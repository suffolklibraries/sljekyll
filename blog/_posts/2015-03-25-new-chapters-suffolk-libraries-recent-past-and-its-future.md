## 2011: Suffolk&#8217;s libraries under threat

Four years ago, it looked very bleak for Suffolk’s libraries.

The council’s consultation suggested that we might have to close a number of libraries if the community didn’t step up to run them.

Nearly 40,000 people across Suffolk responded and an inspiring groundswell of support led to a change of direction with a commitment to keep libraries open, and create a new body to deliver them.

## 2012: The industrial and provident society

Three years ago, we had just registered the new body — Suffolk’s Libraries Industrial and Provident Society ltd — and we were working hard to get everything ready for transfer.

At the time, everyone took a leap of faith. Customers wanted to ensure that their local services would survive and be maintained. Staff wanted to keep the jobs they loved and carry on providing the help and support they excel at to their local communities. The council wanted a sustainable footing for its library service, which was cheaper than the in-house service.

## The service today

So here we are today.

All our libraries are still open. In fact some have better opening hours than before and they offer more, rather than less, with free wifi and new computers everywhere. We’ve just had a countywide book festival, every library has a variety of community activities and events and everyone can use our free music and eBook downloads.

Our libraries are still run by paid staff. This year we introduced the Living Wage, which means that all our staff are guaranteed more than the minimum wage, we have annual percentage increases of pay, and a Rewards Scheme to recognise staff who go beyond. Over 60 people have been recognised in the first ten months.

Our budget for next year from Suffolk County Council will be 30% less than the library budget of 2010/11 which was &pound;8.9 million. We have been inventive and innovative to stretch what we have and make it go further.

In December 2014 we were described as the ‘gold standard’ for others to follow by William Sieghart, the man who led the [Government’s independent enquiry into libraries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-library-report-for-england). This month two other library services have decided to follow our lead and are establishing mutual organisations based on ours.

This is very flattering; however, we know the opinion which matters the most is yours.

We carried out a customer survey in 2013 and will repeat this later in 2015. Over 90% of you felt that your library service had stayed the same or got better.

There is a [community group for every library](/about/member-organisations/) and they give us strong local feedback on what is right for their local service. Some have led a change in opening hours, initiated new services, and there has even been a change to a local library’s name. These groups also elect our Board.

If you would like to get involved in your local group, speak to the local library staff or contact us on help@suffolklibraries.co.uk

## The future

We are also looking ahead. In October last year we launched [our 2020 Vision](/assets/pdf/suffolk-libraries-2020-strategy-our-vision-for-the-future.pdf) (PDF) which sets out our plans to keep our service strong, responsive and viable.

Even a quick read will show you that reading, learning, information and help will always be at the heart of what we are and what we do.

Thank you all for your support. In the past it made the difference between closure and decline. In the future it will help us to survive and flourish as a well-used and thriving library service.
