Our seven libraries in the Ipswich area - [Broomhill](/libraries/broomhill-library/), [Chantry](/libraries/chantry-library/), [Gainsborough](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/), [Ipswich](/libraries/ipswich-county-library), [Kesgrave](/libraries/kesgrave-library/), [Rosehill](/libraries/rosehill-library/) and [Stoke](/libraries/stoke-library) - run several regular activities for children of various ages. These range from stories and singing for babies and toddlers, to crafts and games for primary school children, to activities and groups for secondary school children.

Our libraries also hold occasional one-off events for children. Check your [local library's page](/libraries/) or our [upcoming special events listing](/events-activities/upcoming/) for details.

## Activities for under 5s

Our [Baby Bounce and Tot Rock events for babies and young children](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) run across all seven libraries. These include stories, singing, movement, and play with toys and instruments.

Some libraries in Ipswich provide additional sessions for babies and pre-school children and their parents/carers:

* [Broomhill Library](/libraries/broomhill-library/) holds a Story Starters session on Thursdays in partnership with Highfield Nursery School and Children's Centre, and an Under 5s Friday Club.
* [Gainsborough Community Library](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/) offers parents and carers the chance to socialise at their extended stay and play sessions on Mondays and Fridays.
* [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) offers a play, rhyme and storytime session on Thursdays.
* [Kesgrave Library](/libraries/kesgrave-library/) holds storytime sessions on Fridays during term times, and offers a themed sofa storytime where parents and carers can chat over coffee on the second Monday of every month.

## Craft activities

All libraries in the Ipswich area hold craft sessions for primary school age children on Sundays, with [Chantry](/libraries/chantry-library/) and [Stoke](/libraries/stoke-library/) also offering these on Saturdays. [Gainsborough](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/) additionally offers children the chance to get creative with Hama-beads every Wednesday.

## Games and clubs

Lego clubs are particularly popular in our libraries at the moment, with [Broomhill](/libraries/broomhill-library/), [Chantry](/libraries/chantry-library/), [Gainsborough](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/) and [Kesgrave](/libraries/kesgrave-library/) all offering children the chance to build to a weekly or monthly theme while making new friends. Children who attend Gainsborough's Lego Club also have the opportunity to play board games and table football during the session.

Each Saturday during term-time, [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) hosts the [Ipswich Junior Chess Club](http://www.ipswichchess.co.uk/junior-chess-club.html) for 6-16 year-olds.

Gainsborough has a particularly wide selection of activities and clubs for children of all ages, with groups for boys aged 8-11 and 12-16, a girls' group and girls' self-esteem group, an art group for 11+ year-olds. These all run weekly, along with a children's activity session each Saturday, where children can try out cooking, science and fitness activities among other things.
