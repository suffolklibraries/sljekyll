See my [mental health reading picks](/health) for reading ideas.

Fiction can help us learn about a mental health condition. Depicting a real condition or situation helps us understand it from a personal, subjective view.

Authors often do a large amount of research into certain conditions or have experience in the field of health, which helps them describe conditions accurately when they put pen to paper. Even [when they don&#8217;t do a huge amount of research](http://www.markhaddon.com/aspergers-and-autism), they can get people thinking.

Stories are also a source of healthy escapism; indeed, the health benefits of picking up a book, magazine or newspaper have some research behind them.

*Reading newspapers, magazines and fiction helps relieve stress.*

Consultancy Mindlab International carried out [research on a group of volunteers at the University of Sussex](http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4245076.Reading_can_help_reduce_stress__according_to_University_of_Sussex_research/). Their stress levels and heart rate were increased through a set of tests and exercises before they tried a range of traditional methods of relaxation.

Interestingly, reading a newspaper or book worked better and faster than listening to music, going for a walk or sitting down with a cup of tea to calm frazzled nerves.

Psychologists say this is because the human mind has to concentrate on reading and the distraction eases the tensions in muscles and the heart. In other words, reading really can improve your health.

## Reading ideas

There are a lot of books out there – fiction and non–fiction – that deal with mental health in some way. I&#8217;ll be choosing 2 or 3 books every month that provide a helpful, original or entertaining insight into various conditions. [Take a look at May&#8217;s picks](/health).
