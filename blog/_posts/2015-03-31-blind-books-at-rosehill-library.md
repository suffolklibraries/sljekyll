Our new display at [Rosehill Library](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/rosehill-library) draws attention to the fact that we&#8217;re closed over the Easter weekend, by encouraging our readers to try something different.

All the books are wrapped in plain paper with the first line of the book, the genre and the accession number printed on the front.

The idea is that rather than judging a book by its cover, or the blurb on the back, borrowers will be enticed by the first line and hopefully discover an author or genre that they didn&#8217;t know they liked.

*Blind books at Rosehill Library*

I chose to use Quick Choice books – books you can&#8217;t reserve – as I thought it would get far too complicated if shelf checks came up on them.

We have had a steady amount of interest since I first put them out (just over a week ago) and it has even been requested that I do some children&#8217;s books as well.

*There are moments in your life that change everything*

As you can see, the first line can vary in length. Sometimes I will add a little bit more if it&#8217;s extremely short and I don&#8217;t think it holds any interest. Luckily, I&#8217;m a fairly quick typer so it doesn&#8217;t take me too long!
