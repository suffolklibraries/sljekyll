Although this list features some bestsellers, rather than being purely the most popular titles, these books have been chosen for their particular significance to the Suffolk Libraries stock unit over the past 12 months.

<h2><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2023056">Artemis Cooper - <cite>Elizabeth Jane Howard&#58; a dangerous innocence</cite></a></h2>

We always knew this would be a big title in Suffolk even when it appeared on our pre&#x02013;publication lists three months in advance. Elizabeth Jane Howard was a much loved writer and was in the Friends group at Bungay Library. Artemis Cooper interviewed Howard on several occasions and has produced a fascinating book. With the local connections it was only natural that Artemis Cooper should visit Bungay Library to talk about her new book, which she did in September.

<h2><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1854490">Graeme Macrae Burnet - <cite>His Bloody Project&#58; documents relating to the case of Roderick Macrae&#58; a novel</cite></a></h2>

The Man Booker Award is always an interesting time for us. The longlist is announced and we make sure we have enough copies but we try not to buy too many in case they do not win. This year Graeme Macrae Burnet’s book was the popular choice of Suffolk readers, if not the official jury. As it was from a small Scottish publisher with a short print run it immediately went out of print as soon as everyone wanted it. The idea of the book is an original one, the reader knows that there's been a murder and who's responsible, so the interest lies in the why and an exploration of the 'crime' from different perspectives. This is a book that plays with your mind. It looks like a Non-Fiction book but it is a novel. A tip if you are reading it, do not skip the foreword. I would file this one under ‘a great read’.
