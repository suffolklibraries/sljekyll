excerpt: 'Ipswich County Library staff and volunteers have made videos for the Take 5 project, answering the question: “How does the library make you happy?”'

When Suffolk Libraries was awarded funding for [Action for Happiness](http://www.actionforhappiness.org/) workshops, I never thought I would be involved in putting together a film on how Ipswich County Library makes people happy.

Laura Wigby from [Volunteering Matters](http://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/) and five enthusiastic volunteers spent a day in Ipswich County Library behind and in front of the camera, learning filming and interviewing skills.

The word was put out to Ipswich County Library groups, staff, volunteers and people who have taken part in previous happiness workshops. They share with us on camera, to answer questions such as “How does the library make you happy?” Here is the result.
