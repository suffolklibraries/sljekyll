excerpt: More Suffolk children than ever took part in the Summer Reading Challenge this year, increasing children's library membership.

Suffolk saw numbers rise again this year as 8227 children signed up to read six books over the summer. This year’s Record Breakers theme in partnership with Guinness World Records features on page 8 of the 2016 edition.

59% of children completed all six books, which is above the average completion rate nationwide. 170 older children and young people also took part by volunteering to help children complete the challenge. Children’s library membership increased by 1482 members, in order to take part in the challenge. The stock team were kept on their toes, ensuring libraries had plenty of appealing books to cope with quarter of a million children’s issues over the summer.

The fun didn’t stop there. Our enthusiastic staff held over 120 record breakers events, accommodating 5300 children who took part. Feedback from parents, carers and children was inspiring. Some parents discovered their children had gone up two reading levels over the summer. Mrs Tricker, who has two boys aged 6 and 8 said:

> This scheme encourages both my boys to read — which is especially good for the ‘non-reader’ of the two. It is getting him into the habit of picking up a book to read and we will be continuing to use the library regularly.

Children have more reading adventures to look forward to next summer, when in honour of Roald Dahls’ centenary, The Reading Agency launch “The Big Friendly Read”, with illustrations by Quentin Blake.
