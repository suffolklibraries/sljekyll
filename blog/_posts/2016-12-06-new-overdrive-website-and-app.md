After a year-long trial with 2 ebook services we have decided to continue delivering our eBook and eAudio book service with OverDrive. The trial period allowed us to spend time gathering customer and staff feedback on both services, as well completing our own tests and comparing the ease of use of both the website and app.

We currently have over 10,000 eBook and eAudio book titles available on OverDrive and we will be adding our Cloud Library stock to this as well as continuing to buy more new stock.

One of the factors in our decision to stay with OverDrive is their [new website](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/) which has recently been unveiled. A new and improved app will also be launched in early 2017. The new OverDrive app will provide a faster, easier digital library experience.

What's changed?

**Better Browsing:**

- Simple availability banners
- New ways to find titles
- New account-level audience filters
- The whole digital library on any device

**Easier Borrowing:**

- More options for signing in
- Easy-to-customize lending periods
- Instant access to titles from the details page
- "Books" icon takes you right to borrowed titles

**Other improved features:**

- Improvements to placing and retrieving holds
- Instant recommendations for your library
- Changes to the renewal process

The website is more flexible for staff and will allow us to create different shelf displays and to promote new titles and collections in a more interesting way, just as we do with physical books in a library building.

We will also be able to continue with our self-publishing project, Suffolk Writes. Your writing can be converted into an eBook and added to the OverDrive catalogue for customers to borrow. So far we have added 42 locally written eBooks, broadening the range and style of eBooks available and giving local writers the chance to get their work read more widely.

You can still access the website in the same way using your library card number and the app is still freely available for both Android and iOS operating systems.
