Last week our brand new Enterprise + Innovation Hub at Ipswich County Library began to take shape with the start of an extensive refurbishment of the library’s second floor.

Formerly the home of the arts library, the hub will be located in the soon to be adapted Carnegie Room and will provide the perfect environment for aspiring entrepreneurs and local business owners looking for versatile meeting space, networking opportunities and information on establishing and managing an organisation.

With the help of our partners, the [Suffolk Chamber of Commerce](http://www.suffolkchamber.co.uk/), the [New Anglia Growth Hub](http://www.newangliagrowthhub.co.uk/), and the [Eastern Enterprise Hub](http://www.eehub.co.uk/), we will be hosting workshops, drop-ins, and one-to-ones on topics of interest to the local Suffolk business community.

Opening this spring, we hope the Enterprise + Innovation Hub will become a thriving centre for ideas and innovation and not just in the meeting room.<figure class="figure alignnone">

We’re also investing in our very own ‘MakerSpace’, The Lab, a fully equipped fabrication studio with state of the art technology and equipment, including 3D printers, Raspberry Pi B+ boards and professional sewing machines.

The Lab is designed with both the novice and the expert in mind: from child to student, professional to grandparent – anyone is welcome.

On Saturdays The Lab will be taken over by the popular [Creative Computing Club](http://www.creativecomputingclub.com/), a social enterprise teaching 11-16 year olds digital skills in a fun and informal learning environment.<figure class="figure aligncenter">

If you think that you might have something to offer in regards to business and management or design and technology, or if you are looking for hireable function and meeting rooms, then email Pippa Geaves at hub@suffolklibraries.co.uk

We’ll be sharing project news and photos so keep your eyes peeled for further updates and information.
