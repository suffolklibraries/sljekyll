**In August, education secretary Nicky Morgan announced that [“improving children’s literacy should be a national mission.”](http://www.gov.uk/government/news/nicky-morgan-and-david-walliams-launch-child-literacy-campaign)** Suffolk Libraries has preceded Ms Morgan on this mission for many years and now is ensuring that every young person in Suffolk is reaching their potential and achieving positive outcomes.

## Why it&#8217;s important to get young people reading for pleasure

I have always believed that reading, libraries and librarians are fundamental in sparking the curiosity and imagination of young people. Pick up a book and you can walk through a cupboard and meet a talking lion, travel forwards in time to see the destruction of planets and read funny (and often disgusting) stories about growing up. Enter a library and you can experience a whole lot more.

As the dedicated Literacy Ambassador for Suffolk Libraries, I want to create a real buzz around books and literacy across Suffolk during the 2015/16 academic year and beyond. I will be working with schools, statutory and voluntary organisations and other interested parties to promote reading for pleasure and the importance of literacy to young people and their families in Suffolk.

## How we&#8217;re inspiring young people to get involved

Launching in North Suffolk during the autumn term 2015 and then countywide, Suffolk Libraries will be rolling out a free programme of activities to schools which includes:

  * a brand new library card and activity pack for all year 7 pupils
  * an introductory assembly about reading for pleasure presented to the students
  * activities for teachers to access throughout the year linked to our literacy calendar

This project will develop:

  * young people&#8217;s natural curiosity and a love for learning
  * new social, moral, spiritual and cultural opportunities for young people in their local community
  * a voice for young people to tell us what they want from a library, how they want it to look and how they want to access it

I have already met with some inspirational people who are keen to be involved with projects such as encouraging groups of dads to visit the library with their children and creating literacy pop-up shops in prominent inner city locations.

We are thinking of calling the project <cite>Beyond the Book</cite> because that is what [our gold standard library service](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SLAnnualReview2014-2015.pdf) offers – a range of opportunities that enhances the magical world of reading and enriches the lives of its users.

## My new blog: An Ambassadorial Diary

I’m launching a new blog about books, reading and young people in Suffolk. I&#8217;m beginning with **Banned Books Week**, a celebration of books that the American public has (unsuccessfully) tried to remove from their public libraries. Believe it or not, they tried to ban Harry Potter claiming that it was promoting the occult and that the lead character fails to set a good example to children as he &#8220;lies, breaks rules, and disobeys authority figures, including the professors at Hogwarts,&#8221;. Powerful things, books…
