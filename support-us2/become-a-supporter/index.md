By joining our Supporter Scheme, you can make an annual, financial contribution to get more involved and enhance the service Suffolk Libraries provides. Your donation will be used to safeguard and improve the work of our 44 libraries and three mobile libraries while continuing to provide the same free services and benefits.

You can join by signing up at one of three price levels:

* [Silver: £25 per year](https://www.goldengiving.com/secure/membership/purchase_input?membershipTypeId=dc71b66a-798c-41ec-8682-dbc16a4f9cff)
* [Gold: £50 per year](https://www.goldengiving.com/secure/membership/purchase_input?membershipTypeId=fbe3428f-c8ef-4fcc-bc90-fc127b5cc63e)
* [Platinum: £150 per year](https://www.goldengiving.com/secure/membership/purchase_input?membershipTypeId=16303335-0bab-4661-8acf-ad0a4fa6ecba)

These single, annual payments are processed by our partner Golden Giving. You'll be offered the chance to top up your donation with Gift Aid during the sign-up process.

You can also pay by cash, cheque or debit/credit card at [your local library](/libraries/), or by debit/credit card by calling [01473 351249](tel:01473351249). The scheme is completely voluntary and at the end of the year we'll ask you if you'd like to sign up again.

**If you wish to spread your payments by Direct Debit, email supporter@suffolklibraries.co.uk**

## What you'll get in return

You'll receive a unique enamel pin badge and an exclusive monthly newsletter packed with advance notice of new library titles and recommendations, offers and competitions. You can opt out of receiving the badge and newsletters if you wish.
