Our volunteers work with library staff to regularly visit customers who cannot make it into the library. They provide much needed social interaction and deliver books, CDs, audio books and DVDs.

See our case studies for [info on how rewarding volunteering for the home library service and Suffolk Libraries can be](/volunteer/volunteer-case-studies/).

The minimum volunteers contribute is a morning or afternoon each month. You'll need access to a car, driving yourself or pairing up with another volunteer.

For more information on volunteering for the home library service, or if you'd like to use the service, email **volunteer@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
