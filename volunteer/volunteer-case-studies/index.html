	<p class="ma0 pa0"><strong>Edna is involved in the library's Top Time group which provides social activities and opportunities for older people:</strong></p>

	<p>"I have volunteered for many years for the Summer Reading Challenge and currently help organise and set up the Top Time Group each week and act as the treasurer. At first, volunteering was something for me to do, as I cannot go out much due to my health. The social side of volunteering with the library is my lifeline."</p>

	<p class="ma0 pa0"><strong>Callum is 19 and has volunteered at his local library:</strong></p>

	<p>"Volunteering at the library has been a thoroughly enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Not only was it great socially, in terms of making friends and interacting with the general public, but it also offered me the chance to develop my personal skills. I would recommend volunteering; it has got me out of the house, can add a lot to your CV and contributes to a valuable community asset."</p>
