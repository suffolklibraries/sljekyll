Our volunteers play a vital part in supporting the library service and the services and activities we provide to local people.

They do not replace paid staff, but work alongside them in a range of roles. Libraries are great places to volunteer and there are many opportunities to get involved.

## What's in it for you?

Research shows that when you give your time to others, there are benefits for you as well:

* You'll meet dynamic, friendly people, make new friends and help to inspire and support others
* Choose from a diverse range of opportunities and activities
* Learn new skills, share those you already have and get some great experience for your CV
* Help to strengthen your local community

> Volunteering ... can have a positive effect on your sense of purpose, autonomy and happiness; it helps to develop skills and self-esteem.
