<p>Volunteers can get involved with Suffolk Libraries in many ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/volunteer/home-library-service/">Home Library Service</a> - weâ€™re often looking for volunteers to take books to older and disabled people in their own homes.</li>
    <li>Volunteers support many of our <a href="/events/">events and activities</a>.</li>
    <li>There are many ways to get involved with our libraries' <a href="/about/legal-information/member-organisations/">Community or 'Friends' groups</a>. You might help with fundraising, running events and community outreach.</li>
    <li>We need hundreds of volunteers to help with the <a href="/events-activities/summer-holidays/summer-reading-challenge/">Summer Reading Challenge</a>, which runs every year. Look out for information from spring onwards.</li>
    <li>We're looking for volunteers to help run our <a href="/events-activities/sporting-memories/">Sporting Memories</a> reminiscence sessions at some libraries.</li>
</ul>

Our volunteers play a vital part in supporting the library service and the services and activities we provide to local people.

They do not replace paid staff, but work alongside them in a range of roles. Libraries are great places to volunteer and there are many opportunities to get involved.

## What's in it for you?

Research shows that when you give your time to others, there are benefits for you as well:

* You'll meet dynamic, friendly people, make new friends and help to inspire and support others
* Choose from a diverse range of opportunities and activities
* Learn new skills, share those you already have and get some great experience for your CV
* Help to strengthen your local community

> Volunteering ... can have a positive effect on your sense of purpose, autonomy and happiness; it helps to develop skills and self-esteem.
