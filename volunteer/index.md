Suffolk Libraries have a fantastic team of volunteers who play a vital part in supporting the library service and the services and activities we provide to local people.

They do not replace paid staff, but work alongside them in an ever increasing range of roles. Libraries are great places to volunteer and there are many opportunities to get involved.

## What's in it for you?

Research shows that when you give your time to others, there are benefits for you as well:

* You'll meet dynamic, friendly people, make new friends and help to inspire and support others

* Choose from a diverse range of opportunities and activities

* Learn new skills, share those you already have and get some great experience for your CV

* Help to strengthen your local community

> "Volunteering ... can have a positive effect on your sense of purpose, autonomy and happiness; it helps to develop skills and self-esteem."

## Volunteering opportunities with Suffolk Libraries

Our volunteer opportunities centre around reading, information, learning and skills, community and wellbeing.

Some libraries offer volunteering opportunities that can help you get back on your feet and feel part of your community again after a period of ill health and will always try to accommodate any disabilities you may have.

There are various volunteering opportunities across the county:

* **[Home Library Service](/mobiles-home/home/)** – We’re often looking for volunteers to take books to older and disabled people in their own homes

* Volunteers are involved in supporting many of our **[events and activities](/events/)**. Have a look at what’s going on and [contact your library](/libraries/) for more information

* All our 44 libraries have **[Community Groups or ‘Friends’ groups](/about/member-organisations/)** who support the library service. There are many ways to get involved with things like fundraising, running events and community outreach. For more information [contact your library](/libraries/)

* The **[Summer Reading Challenge](https://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/)** runs in libraries every year and hundreds of volunteers are needed to help. Look out for information from spring onwards and [contact your library](/libraries/)

* We occasionally advertise specific volunteering opportunities on the [Volunteer Suffolk website](http://volunteersuffolk.org.uk/get-involved)
