We’re lucky to have a fantastic team of volunteers who play a vital role in supporting the library service and the services and activities we provide to local people. They do not replace paid staff, but work alongside them in an ever increasing range of roles.

Libraries are great places to volunteer:

- Meet dynamic, friendly people, make new friends and help to inspire and support others
- Choose from a diverse range of opportunities and activities to get involved with
- Learn new skills, share those you already have and get some great experience for your CV
- Help strengthen your local community

## Some examples of volunteering roles

Our [Home Library Service](/mobiles-home/home/) involves volunteers across the county taking library books to disabled and older people in their own homes.

Each of our 44 libraries has [its own Community or ‘Friends’ Group](/about/member-organisations/) made up of local volunteers. These groups are always looking for new members.

You can also [contact your local library](/libraries/) to see if they have any other volunteering opportunities.

 If you’re thinking of volunteering take a look at our Volunteer and Equal Opportunities policies:
