Our volunteers play a vital part in supporting the library service and the services and activities we provide to local people.

They do not replace paid staff, but work alongside them in a range of roles. Libraries are great places to volunteer and there are many opportunities to get involved.

## What's in it for you?

Research shows that when you give your time to others, there are benefits for you as well:

* You'll meet dynamic, friendly people, make new friends and help to inspire and support others
* Choose from a diverse range of opportunities and activities
* Learn new skills, share those you already have and get some great experience for your CV
* Help to strengthen your local community

> Volunteering ... can have a positive effect on your sense of purpose, autonomy and happiness; it helps to develop skills and self-esteem.

## Volunteering opportunities with Suffolk Libraries

Our volunteer opportunities centre around reading, information, learning and skills, community and wellbeing.

Some libraries offer volunteering opportunities that can help you get back on your feet and feel part of your community again after a period of ill health. We will always try to accommodate any disabilities you may have.

To find out more about what our volunteers do, see our [volunteer case studies](/volunteer/volunteer-case-studies/)

If you want to get involved, [contact your local library](/libraries/) or email **volunteer@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.
