      <p class="measure center mb4">In the lead-up to Suffolk Libraries Day (7-12 October), we’ve challenged ourselves to send a book by a local author to all 44 of our libraries, from Bungay to Haverhill. The book will cover a total distance of 323.9 miles!</p>

        <p>Can your organisation facilitate and sponsor a leg of the book’s journey? It can be a short or long part of the trip (distances range from 1.2 to 19.7 miles) and you can use any type of transport. We've already had lots of media interest, so if your transportation method is particularly creative or quirky, it's bound to get some attention — be prepared for photos and possibly interviews!</p>

        <p>We’d also love it if your company would consider match-funding any sponsorship your staff raise for the challenge.</p>
