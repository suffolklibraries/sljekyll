Open Space is a weekly drop-in group run in partnership with Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, Julian Support, Richmond Fellowship and Suffolk Mind. There is no need to sign up, you can attend as often or as little as you like and feel free to come and go during sessions.

Our timetables of discussions and activities are built from suggestions from groups and there is always colouring, word searches and games available, along with a hot drink and a biscuit.

If youâ€™re looking to meet new people and find out about local events and resources to support your wellbeing then please drop in and see us!
