We've launched a new weekly Open Space session especially for young people at Chantry Library. Why not come along and:

* listen, chat and think
* contribute your views and ideas
* try out new activities and provide feedback
* meet and get to know others
* find out about free local events and resources.

Free refreshments and cold drinks will be provided.

If you have any questions please do get in touch, or just come along to a session on Thursdays from 3:30pm-5:30pm at [Chantry Library](/libraries/chantry-library/)! You can come and just listen if you prefer and drop in and out as you please.

We've made a plan for the first few weeks to get the group up and running, but what happens after that is up to you!
