We're currently reviewing our young people's Open Space at Chantry Library to make sure itâ€™s the best it can be. The weekly sessions are on pause for now but we hope to relaunch the group very soon.

If you are a young person in the Chantry area and would be interested in attending, or if you have any ideas you would like to share, email **sarah.lungley@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
