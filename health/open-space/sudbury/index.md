Sudbury Library's Open Space doesn't have a timetable - we have a range of mindful activities on offer each week, or you can just chat if you prefer. There's tea and coffee, no obligation to talk, and you can drop in and out as you please.

If you have any questions please do get in touch, or just come along to a session on Thursdays from 12:30-2:30pm at [Sudbury Library](/libraries/sudbury-library/)&#8211; all are welcome!
