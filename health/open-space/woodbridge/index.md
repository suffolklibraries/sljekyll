Open Space launches at Woodbridge Library on Wednesday 11 September. Drop in for chat, colouring, word searches, games and refreshments. We plan to build a timetable of activities and discussions from suggestions within the group over the coming weeks.

If you have any questions please do get in touch, or just come along to a session on Wednesdays from 2-4pm at [Woodbridge Library](/libraries/woodbridge-library/)&#8211; all are welcome!
