Here is the latest timetable for Open Space at Stowmarket Library. Lots of exciting things coming up and some great discussions.

If you have any questions please do get in touch, or just come along to a session on Tuesdays from 11am-1pm at [Stowmarket Library](/libraries/stowmarket-library/)&#8211; all are welcome!

Running order: lunch/tea/coffee &rarr; informal discussion topic or activity &rarr; tea/coffee. You can come and just listen if you prefer and drop in and out as you please.
