Ten of our libraries currently provide **free sanitary items with no questions asked**:

* [Broomhill Library](/libraries/broomhill-library)
* [Bungay Library](/libraries/bungay-library/)
* [Bury St Edmunds Library](/libraries/bury-st-edmunds-library/)
* [Chantry Library](/libraries/chantry-library)
* [Gainsborough Community Library](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/)
* [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/)
* [Lowestoft Library](/libraries/lowestoft-library/)
* [Newmarket Library](/libraries/newmarket-library/)
* [Rosehill Library](/libraries/rosehill-library/)
* [Stoke Library](/libraries/stoke-library/)

You can request tampons and pads for all flows and preferences by completing a simple, discreet form in the library and handing it to a member of staff.

While exact matches and amounts canâ€™t be guaranteed, we will do our best to provide you with what you request, or something similar.

We are hoping to extend this scheme to other libraries after an initial pilot period. [Find out more about the pilot launch](/news/pride-and-periods/).

The items have been donated by supporting organisations [East of England Co-op](https://www.eastofengland.coop/), [Pink Parcel](https://www.pink-parcel.com/uk/) and [Bloody Good Period](https://www.bloodygoodperiod.com/).

If you have any questions or would like to enquire about making donations, email **sarah.lungley@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
