## Healthy minds

### [<cite>What's Going On Inside My Head?: starting conversations with your child about positive mental health</cite>, by Molly Potter & Sarah Jennings](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2503333)

> "We all know that healthy minds are really important but how do we make sure we look after our mental health from a very young age? <cite>What's Going On Inside My Head?</cite> is a book for children that explores practical ways we can keep our minds in good shape as well as our bodies.

> "By talking about positive self-image, emotional intelligence, relationships, and mindfulness, this book will help children develop healthy habits and good coping strategies from the start. Presented in a warm, child-friendly but no-nonsense way, it will help establish solid foundations for every child's current and future wellbeing."

### [<cite>Healthy for Life: Self-esteem and Mental Health</cite>, by Anna Claybourne & Dan Bramall](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2056639)

> "Growing up isn't always easy - your brain is changing and there's many things to cope with from new emotions to stress. This book explores what is self-esteem and mental health and why it's important and looks at topics such as mental illness, phobias, eating disorders and self-harm. It looks at techniques to deal with issues including stress reduction, mindfulness and assertiveness."

### [<cite>How Not to Lose It: mental health sorted</cite>, by Anna Williamson & Sophie Beer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2522760)

> "Creating healthy habits. Staying in the moment. Breaking negative thought patterns. Finding things to be happy about. Tricks like this are like taking your mood to the gym –helping you feel good and bounce back from obstacles. Attitudes, fears, stress levels: take charge of yours right now!"

## Feelings

### [<cite>How Are You Feeling Today?</cite>, by Molly Potter & Sarah Jennings](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1613106)

> "A great dip-in book where children can choose a feeling that relates to them and then turn to the page that provides child-friendly strategies for dealing with that feeling. Helpful parent/carer notes at the back of the book provide more ideas for parents to use with their child and other strategies to try out together and practice the all-important skill of dealing with feelings."

### [<cite>Exploring Emotions: a mindfulness guide to dealing with emotions</cite>, by Paul Christelis & Elisa Paganelli](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2303811)

### [<cite>Sometimes I Feel Sad</cite>, by Tom Alexander](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2332317)

> "Feeling sad is, unfortunately, a part of everyone's life, and there's not always an easy fix. This touching book helps explain to children that they're not alone in feeling this way, and is especially useful for children who struggle to express their feelings."

## Worries

### [<cite>Ruby's Worry</cite>, by Tom Percival](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2403768)

> "Ruby loves being Ruby. Until, one day, she finds a worry. At first, it's not such a big worry, and that's all right, but then it starts to grow. It gets bigger and bigger every day and it makes Ruby sad. How can Ruby get rid of it and feel like herself again?

> "When Ruby makes a friend –who has a worry too –and talks about what's bothering her, everything explodes with colour and the world goes back to normal. Ruby soon realises that everybody gets worries, and they are nothing to be ashamed of.

> "This is a perceptive and poignant story about anxiety and how a problem shared is a problem halved."

### [<cite>Questions and Feelings About... Worries</cite>, by Paul Christelis & Ximena Jeria](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2402460)

### [<cite>Grobblechops</cite>, by Elizabeth Laird & Jenny Lucander](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2504629)

> "Amir doesn’t want to go to bed. He is scared of the dark and afraid there might be a monster under his bed; a monster called Grobblechops who has huge teeth and growls like a tiger.

> "Dad reassures Amir that if he growls louder, the monster will go away – but Amir can’t help catastrophising and worrying that Grobblechops’s mum and dad will join in the fight and eat him up. Luckily, Amir’s dad is a bit of an expert when it comes to monsters, and can rationalise and defuse all his son’s anxiety to the point where Grobblechops becomes a friend rather than a threat.

> "Stunning, collage-style illustrations reflect the quelling of Amir’s fears as Grobblechops and his parents subtly mutate from frightening to friendly"

### [<cite>Me and My Fear</cite>, by Francesca Sanna](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2403417)

> "A heart-warming and relevant new tale from the bestselling author and illustrator of [<cite>The Journey</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1952416), this book shows us the importance of sharing your Fear with others - after all, everyone carries a Fear with them, even if it's small enough to fit into their pocket!"
