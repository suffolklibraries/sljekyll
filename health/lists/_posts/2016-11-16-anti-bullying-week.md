![Something Else, How To Fly With Broken Wings, The Icarus Show](/images/featured/featured-bullying-2018.jpg)

For Anti Bullying Week, we've put together a list of recommendations for children and young adults on the subject of bullying.

Bullying can be frightening and isolating, so we hope that these titles help young people who are being bullied to feel less alone, and seek help.

Even if they're not being bullied, it's important for children to understand how it feels to be in such a situation and learn what to do if they experience or witness bullying.
