> "On the surface it seems that Bryony Gordon has the perfect life. One of the UK's most successful journalists, she is married to a man she loves with a two-year-old daughter she adores. Yet inside Bryony's head things are never as straightforward as they seem. Is it possible that she's murdered someone and can't remember? Why did her hair fall out when she was a teenager? Is she capable of hurting her daughter? Has she mysteriously contracted an STD? Why is she always so fat? For while Bryony does have a life many would envy, she is also engaged in a daily battle with mental illness.

> "Fighting with OCD, bulimia and depression, like millions of others in this country, sometimes she finds it a struggle just to get out of bed. Here, in <cite>Mad Girl</cite>, she tackles all of these subjects with her trademark humour, warmth and eye watering honesty."

Or at least make you feel like you're not so alone.

## [<cite>What the ******** is Normal?!</cite>, by Francesca Martinez](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1754168)

> "What do you do when you're labelled abnormal in a world obsessed with normality? If you grow up in a world where wrinkles are practically illegal, cellulite is cause for a mental breakdown and women over a size ten are encouraged to shoot themselves (immediately), what the **** do you do if you're, gasp, disabled?

> "When Francesca was two years old, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Her parents were told by a consultant that she would never lead a normal life. For many girls, this would have meant hiding away and accepting some things were beyond their reach. Not this girl.

> "This book is personal, funny and insightful, and explores just how bloody hard it is to learn to like yourself - wobbly or not - in this world."
