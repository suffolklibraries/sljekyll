![Pain Is Really Strange, How I Rescued My Brain, The Selfish Pig's Guide to Caring](/images/featured/featured-reading-well-long-term.jpg)

The Reading Agency and Society of Chief Librarians have released a new list of Reading Well books for people with long-term conditions such as chronic pain, arthritis and diabetes.

The scheme, supported by Public Health England, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the National Association of Primary Care, aims to help library users who live with or care for someone with a long-term illness better understand and manage their conditions.

## General

### [<cite>How to Feel Better: Practical ways to recover well from Illness and Injury</cite>, by Frances Goodhart & Lucy Atkins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1336400)

> "In days gone by, people understood that a knock to your health takes its toll on your emotions, your relationships, your morale, your 'spirit'. But these days, we think that if the doctor has waved you off, then you are 'better'. We neglect what scientific studies show is a vital element of recovery: the emotional side of getting better. As a result, many of us struggle with hidden issues such as depression, stress and anxiety long after a health crisis.

> "This book centres on the crucial, research-based truth that 'getting better' is not just about the body - emotions play a huge part."

### [<cite>Self-management of Long-term Health Conditions</cite>, by Kate Lorig](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2181037)

> "Chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalitis, (CFS/ME) affects approximately 180,000 people in the UK. In addition to persistent and abnormal tiredness, sufferers commonly experience muscle pain, headaches, sleep disturbance and loss of concentration as well as a range of other symptoms. At its worst it can be completely disabling and yet it is still poorly understood and often regarded as purely psychological.

> "This practical manual comes from a nationally recognized centre for the condition and is jointly written by health professionals and their patients. They give straightforward and specific expert advice, accompanied by real life stories, on managing different aspects of everyday life that can affect energy, and they show how to put this advice into practice."

> "Drawing on the authors' extensive experience and the latest research, <cite>Manage Your Pain</cite> explains the positive and practical ways in which you can adapt to chronic pain and minimise the impact it has on your life. The way forward is to understand that there is a pattern to the pain you suffer and that practical steps can be taken to return to normal life."

This book looks at the learning curve involved in sudden and chronic illness, and explores key ways to build psychological resilience during this time of challenge."

### [<cite>Mindfulness for Health: A practical guide to relieving pain, reducing stress and restoring wellbeing</cite>, by Vidyamala Burch & Danny Penman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1336402)
