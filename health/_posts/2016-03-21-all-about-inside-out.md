Not an achievement for ourselves exactly but witnessing the continuing positive impact of the arts on peoples lives. ‘I feel more alive after an Inside Out session’ (recent participant)

I write. I sing. I walk

Charles Dickens. His characterisations are amazing. He knew a thing or two about the human condition.
