Earlier this year (May 16-20) we saw a fantastic range of events and library visits in aid of Mental Health Awareness Week. Here's a little look back at some of the things we got up to...

Several of our wonderful libraries set up displays, using Books on Prescription, Shelf Help for Young people and lots of other books and information on mental health and wellbeing topics. Here's a few pictures from Beccles, Haverhill and Ipswich, including a display for Dementia Awareness week from the Alzheimer’s Society.

Haverhill Library also put together this brilliant creative display, based on the Open Space group's discussion on what happiness is and how you can create it for yourself.

I was lucky enough to spend the whole day with Suffolk Family Carers on their bus, visiting Great Cornard, Haverhill and Hadleigh talking to people about what we can offer. It was a great day full of great conversation, cups of tea, and some very talented reversing from our driver Pete!

I also attended Richmond Fellowship's event in Sudbury, celebrating more than 20 years of incredible support in the community for those with mental health problems (Congratulations to them!). It was wonderful to see so many different organisations coming together to share their work and support, along with meeting lots of people from the local community.

Ipswich County Library held an information event, which was attended by 10 different community organisations and gave customers a great chance to find out about some of the support available in the community. We thank all of you who came to display and those who came to chat to the stalls - it was a great event, and something we hope to do more of in the future.

And to top it all off, our Open Space group in Ipswich was visited by Time to Change's regional coordinator, Maddi Cassell, who spoke about their campaign and signed up some of our attendees to become Time to Change champions. Our very own Time to Change champions will be working together in the upcoming months to talk about creating events in our libraries to help break the stigma surrounding mental health and we couldn't be prouder!

We hope that those of you who visited libraries for events, viewed displays, took out books and chatted to our staff enjoyed Mental Health Awareness week - we're looking forward to next year already!
