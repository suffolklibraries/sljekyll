Our mental health information services information coordinator David Grimmer picks books that deal with health and wellbeing issues. This month it&#8217;s two modern novels, one about a man tackling the mental health system, the other a 90 year old detective with dementia. Both won the Costa award.

You can reserve these books and pick them up from your library:

## [<cite>The shock of the fall</cite> by Nathan Flier](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5491189?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2835744194%29&QRYTEXT=The%20shock%20of%20the%20fall)

Author Nathan Flier is a registered mental health nurse and his book gives us an insight into the life of Matt, a man struggling with the mental health system, doodling and typing out his thoughts on a typewriter. The story also reflects on grief and the loss of Matt&#8217;s brother Simon, who had down&#8217;s syndrome.
