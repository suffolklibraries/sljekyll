<p class="mt0">Aimed at younger readers, this book focuses on Liam’s move to his Grandma&#8217;s house. It sensitively deals with dementia, growing older and losing friendships. Woven into a story of mysterious stone gargoyle and spooky churches, this book will prove to be both educational and entertaining.</p>

<p class="mt0">From the author of <cite>The unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry</cite> comes Joyce&#8217;s second novel, which combines two stories; one starting in 1972, and the other in the present day. The story of Byron and Jim starts during a leap year, where these two friends become obsessed that two seconds could be added to time and what could happen when it does. Dealing with living with and alongside OCD and and the fragility of relationships, this is a story that will stay with you.</p>
