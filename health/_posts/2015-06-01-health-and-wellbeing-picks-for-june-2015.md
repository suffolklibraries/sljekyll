Our [mental health information services](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/community-services/mental-health-information-services) information coordinator David Grimmer picks books that deal with health and wellbeing issues. This month we have recommendations from Sara at Bury St Edmunds Library and Tracey at Haverhill Library.

You can reserve these books and pick them up from your library:

## [<cite>The mirror world of Melody Black</cite> by Gavin Extence](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY_NAME=TI&ENTRY=The+Mirror+World+of+Melody+Black&ENTRY1_OPER=%2B&ENTRY2_NAME=AU&ENTRY2=&ENTRY2_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_NAME=SU&ENTRY3=&ENTRY_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_OPER=%2B&NRECS=20&SORTS=HBT.SOVR&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH&CF=GEN&ISGLB=0&GQ=The+Mirror+World+of+Melody+Black)

This book goes a long way not to paint a negative picture of someone living with bipolar disorder. In fact, it shows an intelligent and witty character who brings humour to the pages. It centres around a character who has bipolar disorder &#8211; not that this is obvious from the start &#8211; and the impact it has on others in her life.

## [<cite>The yellow wallpaper</cite> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20213900?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(573055)&QRYTEXT=The%20yellow%20wallpaper)

Written in the late 19th century, the main character in this novella has depression after the birth of her child. She endures a recommended cure that has the opposite effect! It is a short and intriguing read but also disturbing; it tells how during a period of depression obsessions can take over the mind, and how easy it is to lose the ability to determine the real from the unreal.
