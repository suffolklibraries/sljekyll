  * Gives you a nice feeling inside

  * A positive feeling/ sensation which makes you feel good
  * **Friends**
  * A feeling
  * **Animals **
  * **It&#8217;s a feeling but I think it is a succession of feelings. You start with feeling well, then wellbeing, then making your own happiness, then happy &#8211; Yippee! **
