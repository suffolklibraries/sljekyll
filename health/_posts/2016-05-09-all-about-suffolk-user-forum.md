<strong>Hi there! Which organisation/project are you from?</strong>

Suffolk User Forum

<strong>Could you tell us a little bit about what you and your organisation/project do? </strong>

Suffolk User Forum (SUF) is a user-led charity based in Kesgrave, Ipswich. We are dedicated to speaking out for the mental health &amp; wellbeing of service users in Suffolk. SUF covers the whole range of services from wellbeing to support; from GP led care and treatment through to voluntary and statutory sector services including in-patient care.

We are a team of four part-time staff all with lived experiences of mental ill health and we are committed to represent the voice of mental health and work with service providers in Suffolk.
