            <p>We are inviting local artists to come and use <a href="/libraries/lowestoft-library/" class="blue underline">Lowestoft Library</a> as a work space to explore the role creativity plays as catalyst for nurturing confidence and wellbeing in the community.</p>

            <p>Six artists will be given the opportunity during the residency to explore their practice as well as their role as creative practitioners in community settings.</p>
