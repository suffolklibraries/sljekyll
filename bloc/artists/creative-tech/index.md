            <p>In April 2018, Suffolk Libraries were awarded NPO status by Arts Council England. Suffolk Libraries is made up of 44 individual libraries across the county and as part of this creative process the BLOC -  Building Libraries on Creativity programme was created to develop libraries as creative community hubs. Suffolk Libraries worked with established NPO Metal to develop the programme with artist led practice being at the heart of the programme’s development.</p>

            <h2 class="f4 f2-ns custom-lh-title">Quotes from August 2018 BLOC Artist in Residence:</h2>

            <blockquote><p>It was an incredibly useful period for reflection, idea 'seeding' and professional/personal development ... I was surprised at how lovely the dinner was as a social event. It was a really fantastic experience to enjoy the company of like-minded people in a work context, just as people.</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>The overall atmosphere of the week was just incredible. Everyone was very welcoming and just lovely! This created an environment where I felt very comfortable in expressing myself and communicating with everyone.</p></blockquote>
