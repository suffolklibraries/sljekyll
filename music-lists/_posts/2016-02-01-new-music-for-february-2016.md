      Unbelievably this is Eltonâ€™s 33rd studio album. Judging by the first release from the album this is a return to his musical roots. It also has lyrics by Bernie Taupin so hopes are high for this one.

    <p>
      It is always a pleasure to welcome a new Lucinda Williams album. The songs on <cite>The ghosts of Highway 20</cite> are linked by a common theme. 12 of the 14 songs were inspired by various periods and experiences throughout Williams&#8217; life that all tie into Highway 20 (aka Interstate 20), which runs in part from Georgia to Texas.
