### [Morrissey: World Peace is None Of Your Business](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/30302969?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40610022)&QRYTEXT=World%20peace%20is%20none%20of%20your%20business%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

<cite>World Peace is None of Your Business</cite> finds Morrissey in classic form, bitterly crooning about social inequality over lush orchestration.

Morrissey&#8217;s 10th solo effort since 2009&#8217;s <cite>Years of Refusal</cite>. After struggling to find a record label, Morrissey signed a two-album deal with Harvest Records and Capitol Music in January 2014.

The former Smiths frontman then set about recording <cite>World Peace…</cite> in France, working with producer Joe Chiccarelli (Alanis Morissette, the Strokes) and many of the same musicians who played on Years of Refusal.

His autobiography is still issuing well so we expect his new music to be popular.

### [Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Hypnotic Eye](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/30314344?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40362659)&QRYTEXT=Hypnotic%20eye%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Their first studio album since 2010, <cite>Hypnotic Eye</cite> is the band&#8217;s 13th.

Co–produced by Petty, Mike Campbell, and Ryan Ulyate, early indications are that the new release sounds like earlier albums 1976&#8217;s <cite>Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers</cite> and <cite>You&#8217;re Gonna Get It</cite> from 1978.

“You sing like you did on the first two albums,” said Petty. “Maybe this album does sound like that. But it&#8217;s that band 30 years later&#8230; I knew I wanted to a do a rock and roll record. We hadn&#8217;t made a straight hard-rockin&#8217; record, from beginning to end, in a long time.”

### [The Struts: Everybody Wants](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/30315056?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40360452)&QRYTEXT=Everybody%20wants%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

The Struts are a band who proudly stand apart from the crowd and steadfastly refuse to chase the latest trends and fads.

They’ve built a loyal fan base through fanatical word of mouth, blistering live shows and monstrous hooks that steadfastly refuse to leave your brain.

The result is high octane, heavy, soulful rock n roll that delivers on every level. The Struts recently supported the Rolling Stones so they are one to watch.

### [Chicago: Now (Chicago XXXVI)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/30315607?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41338072)&QRYTEXT=Chicago%20XXXVI%3A%20Now%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Although never what you would term fashionable, Chicago are second only to the Beach Boys as the most successful American rock band of all time. The new album is their 36th(!) since they formed in 1967, and features 11 new songs.

### [The Vikings II (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) by Trevor Morris](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/VHJldm9yIE1vcnJpcw==/29192623/c29ueQ)

Whenever you want to hear a great TV score these days, you usually go to Trevor Morris who has consistently been delivering greatness like <cite>The Tudors</cite> or <cite>Pillars of the Earth</cite>.

In Vikings, a lot of what you hear are mood cues like <cite>The Sunstone</cite>, cues that just linger and tell you about what’s happening on screen in a subtle way.

### [Stay Gold by First Aid Kit](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/Rmlyc3QgQWlkIEtpdA==/29139359/c29ueQ)

It&#8217;s six years since sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg uploaded the woodland–set Fleet Foxes cover that would go on to grant them fame. Three albums in, and their voices still chime like a Swedish Everly Brothers.

<cite>Stay Gold</cite> features the singles <cite>My Silver Lining</cite> and <cite>Cedar Lane</cite>. The album debuted at number 11 in the UK Albums Chart.

### [Blonde by Alizee](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/QWxpesOpZQ==/29174168/c29ueQ)

Blonde is the upcoming 6th studio album of the French recording artist Alizée.

Alizée’s success on French television show <cite>Danse avec les stars</cite> shot her to fame in her homeland.

### [48:13 by Kasabian](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/S2FzYWJpYW4=/29116177/c29ueQ)

48:13 is the 5th studio album from the English rock band and was produced by the band&#8217;s guitarist Sergio Pizzorno.

The album entered at number one on the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release – band&#8217;s fourth consecutive UK number one.

### [Blue Smoke: The Best of by Dolly Parton](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/RG9sbHkgUGFydG9u/29239319/c29ueQ)
