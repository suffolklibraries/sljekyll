      Star title for December. Coldplay’s seventh album features more guests than any previous Coldplay record, including Beyoncé and Noel Gallagher. There is speculation that this could be Coldplay’s final album; in a December 2014 interview Chris Martin said, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34743843">“It’s our seventh thing and the way we look at it it’s like the last Harry Potter book. That’s not to say there won’t be another thing one day, but this is the completion of something.”</a>

      Spanning several genres, this remix album presents a fresh take on the band&#8217;s last album <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12805770?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(15175829)&QRYTEXT=Listen%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D">Listen</a></cite>. While spending time in New York, the band heard a number of DJs mixing their tracks. Then after witnessing the clubbers&#8217; response to a 4/4 beat over their previously more rock orientated productions, they knew they had to pursue the idea of a club focused remix album.

      Cass McCombs is possibly a name you will not be familiar with. Comprising songs from 2003-2014, the album showcases McCombs&#8217; lo-fi style. If you&#8217;re a fan of bands like Eels then this is worth checking out.

      Recorded in concert at the Bouffes du Nord in Paris in December 2014, this live CD features the band performing alongside 75-year-old &#8216;grand dame&#8217; of Tamashek culture, Lalla Badi. A hypnotic evening of guitar and tinde (small mortar drum covered by a taut goatskin) normally reserved for more intimate spaces, this very special show came at the end of a tour comprising more than 130 dates, undertaken in part to promote their last album <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12806769?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36218283)&QRYTEXT=Emmaar">Emmaar</a></cite>.
