## Our picks

<small>Here in the web team, we&#8217;ve chosen a few of our favourite acts appearing at Glastonbury this year.</small>

### Leon&#8217;s pick: [<cite>Grotesque</cite> by The Fall](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31735551?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(94536)&QRYTEXT=Grotesque)

  </div>

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      1980’s <cite>Grotesque</cite> is the Fall’s third album, and the first where they really hit their stride — a year later they’d release their masterpiece <cite>Hex Enduction Hour</cite>. Funny, poppy, ramshackle, spikey and to the point, it has some of Smith’s best lyrical moments. Highlights include trucker anthem <cite>Container Drivers</cite>, a kazoo-driven paranoid tale of wireless enthusiasts and government wiretapping called <cite>New Face in Hell</cite> and the deranged, 9 minute epic <cite>The North Will Rise Again</cite>. Although the Fall and Glastonbury is a seemingly odd mix, I’m sure it’ll be great fun. They will perform at the Park Stage on Sunday.

### Maddie&#8217;s pick: [<cite>Tough Love</cite> by Jessie Ware](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31738884?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17294879)&QRYTEXT=Tough%20love%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      An eclectic mashup of R&#8217;n&#8217;B grooves with smooth soul rhythms. With contributions from electronic producer Julio Bashmore and chart topper Ed Sheeran, <cite>Tough Love</cite> has a lot of talent hidden beneath Ware’s haunting vocals. The songs are perfectly chilled and subtle, some of my favourites being <cite>Say You Love Me</cite> and <cite>Sweetest Song</cite>. If you are looking for an album that relaxes and intrigues, then <cite>Tough Love</cite> should be on your iPod! Jessie Ware is performing on the John Peel Stage on Saturday.
