Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we revealed our libraries' favourite books. But as we have more than 30 libraries, we're spilling over into May! Today, Southwold Library has chosen <cite>Oi Frog!</cite>, by Kes Gray & Jim Field.

> "This is a tale about a frog who discovers that all animals have their special places to sit! Cats sit on mats, hares sit on chairs, mules sit on stools and gofers sit on sofas, but Frog does not want to sit on a log! Jam-packed with animals and silliness, this original story will have young children in fits of laughter."
