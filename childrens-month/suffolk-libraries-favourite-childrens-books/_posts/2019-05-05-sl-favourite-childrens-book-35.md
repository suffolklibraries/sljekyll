Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we revealed our libraries' favourite books. But as we have more than 30 libraries, we're spilling over into May! Today, Oulton Broad Library has chosen <cite>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</cite>, by Jeff Kinney.

> "I'll be famous one day, but for now I'm stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons.

> "Desperate to prove his new found maturity, which only going up a grade can bring, Greg is happy to have his not-quite-so-cool sidekick, Rowley, along for the ride.

> "But when Rowley's star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend's popularity to his own advantage.

> "Recorded in his diary with comic pictures and his very own words, this test of Greg and Rowley's friendship unfolds with hilarious results."
