**[See <cite>Monkey and Me</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=244032)**

Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Stoke Library has chosen <cite>Monkey and Me</cite>, by Emily Gravett.

> "A mischievous little girl and her toy monkey swing irresistibly through the pages of this playful book. Young children will love guessing what animal they are pretending to be, before shouting out the answers as the pages are turned to reveal the real creatures. Soon everyone will be waddling like a penguin, jumping like a kangaroo and waving their arm like an elephant's trunk!"
