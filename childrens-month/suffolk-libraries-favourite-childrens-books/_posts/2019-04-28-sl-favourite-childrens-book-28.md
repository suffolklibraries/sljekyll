Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Kedington Library has chosen <cite>The Paper Dolls</cite>, by Julia Donaldson & Rebecca Cobb.

> "A string of paper dolls go on a fantastical adventure through the house and out into the garden. They soon escape the clutches of the toy dinosaur and the snapping jaws of the oven-glove crocodile, but then a very real pair of scissors threatens."
