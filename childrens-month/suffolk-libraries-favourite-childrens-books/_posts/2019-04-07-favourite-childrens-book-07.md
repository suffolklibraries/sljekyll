Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Ipswich County and Newmarket libraries have chosen <cite>The Gruffalo</cite>, by Julia Donaldson & Axel Scheffler.

> "This is a rhyming story of a mouse and a monster. Little mouse goes for a walk in a dangerous forest. To scare off his enemies he invents tales of a fantastical creature called the Gruffalo. Imagine his surprise when he meets the real Gruffalo!"
