Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Halesworth Library has chosen <cite>Potkin and Stubbs</cite>, by Sophie Green & Karl James Mountford.

> "Lil Potkin lives in bleak Peligan City. Her mum works in City Hall and is rarely at home, so aspiring journalist Lil has all the time she needs to explore the city in her bright yellow raincoat, investigating unsolved stories.

> "One rainy evening Lil meets a sad-looking boy sitting by himself in the bus station and buys him a hot chocolate. That night Lil wakes to find him in her bedroom. He doesn't want to admit to being a ghost, but when he finally remembers his name (Nedly - possibly) he explains that he needs Lil's help to find out what happened to him after he disappeared from his orphanage a year ago.

> "So Lil and Nedly - aka Potkin and Stubbs - team up to solve their mystery, and they call in the reluctant help of once-famous detective Abe Mandrel."
