Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Bungay Library have chosen <cite>Tadpole's Promise</cite>, by Jeanne Willis & Tony Ross.

> "Tadpole loves his friend, the caterpillar, and she loves him too. 'Promise that you will never change,' she says, but as the seasons pass he matures - and what has happened to his friend? As he sits on his lily pad digesting the butterfly he has just eaten, he little realises he will never know!"
