Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Capel St Mary Library have chosen <cite>Dog Man</cite>, by Dav Pilkey.

> "When Greg the police dog and his cop companion are injured on the job, a life-saving surgery changes the course of history, and Dog Man is born. With the head of a dog and the body of a human, this heroic hound has a real nose for justice. But can he resist the call of the wild to answer the call of duty?"
