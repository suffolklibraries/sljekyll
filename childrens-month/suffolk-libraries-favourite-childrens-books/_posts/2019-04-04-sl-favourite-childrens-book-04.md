Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Broomhill Library have chosen <cite>Captain Flinn and the Pirate Dinosaurs: The Magic Cutlass</cite>, by Giles Andreae & Russell Ayto.

> "During the school play, Flinn finds himself slap-bang on the deck of a real-live pirate ship... and he's not alone! Pirate Diplodocus, Pirate Triceratops, Pirate Stegosaurus and, of course, his old arch-enemy, Captain T. Rex, are all there too. They are all on the hunt for the famous magic cutlass that can grant wishes - WATCH OUT, CAPTAIN FLINN! But you have to be careful what you wish for, and that dastardly Captain T. Rex soon finds himself in more trouble than ever!"
