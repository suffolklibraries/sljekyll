Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Clare Library has chosen <cite>Homer the Library Cat</cite>, by Reeve Lindbergh & Anne Wilsdorf.

> "Homer is a very quiet cat. He lives in a very quiet house with a very quiet lady. But one day, while the lady is away, Homer hears a very loud crash, and out of the window he goes! Poor Homer just wants to find a spot where he can curl up undisturbed, but his hometown is a surprisingly hectic place."
