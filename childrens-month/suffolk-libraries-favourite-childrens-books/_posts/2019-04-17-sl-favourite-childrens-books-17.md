Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Framlingham Library has chosen <cite>Owl Babies</cite>, by Martin Waddell & Patrick Benson.

> "This is the story of three baby owls, Sarah, Percy and Bill, who wake one night to find their mother gone. And as the darkness gathers and they perch patiently on their branch waiting for her return, oh how they worry! What are those scary noises all around them? What is mum doing? When will she be back?"
