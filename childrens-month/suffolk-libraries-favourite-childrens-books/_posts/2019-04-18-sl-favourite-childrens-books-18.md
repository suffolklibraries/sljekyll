Every day throughout [Children's Month](/childrens-month/) (April 2019), we'll be revealing our libraries' favourite books. Today, Mildenhall Library has chosen <cite>The Wonky Donkey</cite>, by Craig Smith & Katz Cowley.

> "In this hilarious, cumulative story, each page tells us something new about the donkey until we end up with a spunky, hanky-panky, cranky, stinky-dinky, lanky, honky-tonky, winky wonky donkey who will have children in fits of laughter!"
