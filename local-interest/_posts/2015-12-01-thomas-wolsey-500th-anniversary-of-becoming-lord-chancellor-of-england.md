      Borman skilfully unpicks the political movements of Cromwell throughout his career, serving both the King and Thomas Wolsey. She expertly highlights the fatal actions that caused his downfall, as well as his own ear-bending, which led to the execution of Anne Boleyn.

    <p>
      A lighter read than most academic biographies of Wolsey. Matusiak has made a great effort to consider Wolsey&#8217;s internal self. He is presented not just as proud and cavalier, but also as a perfectionist, who would overload himself with work and became prone to bursts of anger when under pressure and stress-related illness. Matusiak demonstrates how more and more was expected of the King&#8217;s chief advisor, until he eventually cracked.
