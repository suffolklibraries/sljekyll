This page contains free resources created by our 2015-16 Literacy Ambassador Matt Shenton for 'Beyond the Book', a programme promoting reading for pleasure for year 7 pupils in Suffolk. Although the programme has now concluded, we have made its resources available for teachers' continued use.

This page contains resources for schools to use in conjunction with the 'Beyond the Book' activity booklet (downloadable below). For each of the 6 activities in the booklet there is a relevant PowerPoint presentation with slides containing notes and tips on delivery. There is also a teacher handbook containing lesson starters, extension activities and plenaries.

There are also supplementary activities and content that may be of interest.

If you have issues with any of the files please email help@suffolklibraries.co.uk or try right click and select save as to download the files.
