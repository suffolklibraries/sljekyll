      <p class="mt2">Our 2015-16 Literacy Ambassador, Matt Shenton, recorded his experiences of running a reading hack group, 'The Beccles Book Bunnies', at <a href="/libraries/beccles-library">Beccles Library</a>. We hope that these pages will help you come up with ideas for and run your own reading hacks.</p>
