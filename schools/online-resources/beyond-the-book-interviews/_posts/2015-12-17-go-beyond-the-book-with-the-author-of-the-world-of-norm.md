![The World of Norm](/images/featured/featured-the-world-of-norm.jpg)

In my previous life as a school librarian I never had the chance to read any of the [<cite>Norm</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24046409?QRY=SEBIB%3C%20IRN(6071865)&QRYTEXT=World%20of%20Norm) books. In fact it was rare to see one for months at a time they were so popular. Eventually I would be presented with a pile of scruffy bits of paper that must have once looked like a book. The pages would be dog-eared and damp with tears of laughter from the many children who had read it. And with that the book had reached the end of its natural life and was ‘retired’, with great reverence, to the library in the sky, and a new copy bought.

It wasn’t until the other month when I saw author Jonathan Meres taking part in the [#ukmgchat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukmgchat&src=typd) on twitter that I realised now was my chance to read one! That and the fact that during the [#ukmgchat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukmgchat&src=typd) they were discussing the literary merits of toilet humour in middle grade books. Naturally I was professionally required, nay obliged, to investigate this possible depravity.

I got my hands on [<cite>The World of Norm: May Cause Irritation</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24045802?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9299010)&QRYTEXT=May%20cause%20irritation.%20%5BPaperback%5D). This is the second of the <cite>Norm</cite> books and begins with Norm finding himself standing totally naked in a supermarket before being arrested by a talking dog. Luckily for Norm this is just a dream! But it&#8217;s a great introduction to the crazy life of Norm and his daily struggle to grow up in a world that so clearly is out to get him. Norm has to deal with trying to outshine his perfect cousins, outwit his devious siblings, live with the most embarrassing mobile phone ever and put up with a new dog that gets more attention than him. Can Norm hatch a cunning plan to come out on top? What does he stand to gain by shaving a dog?!

I can see why young people love the Norm books as they are such flipping fun to read. Young people love them for the humour and because they deal with issues around growing up and finding your place in the world. There are also brilliant illustrations by Donough O’Malley throughout the book that bring the characters and situations to life.

We asked Jonathan Meres to go &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; with us. He said yes AND provided up with our first piece of original artwork!

### Hello there, where in the world are you today?

55 degrees & 55 minutes North, 3 degrees & 10 mins west. Roughly.

### What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)

Nothing. It&#8217;s completely dark.

### How many words have you written today? (be honest!)

About 700. Or about 7000 if you include Twitter, Facebook & emails.

### What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)

### If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?

[<cite>The Cat In The Hat</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24044076?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(168576)&QRYTEXT=The%20Cat%20in%20the%20Hat) by Dr Seuss. And yes. I&#8217;d hide his hat.

### It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?

Exactly the same as it does now. But with even more choice. Oh and librarians with jetpacks.

### We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?

[<cite>Life on Earth</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24043607?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(27446)&QRYTEXT=Life%20on%20earth%20%3A%20a%20natural%20history) by Sir David Attenborough.

Thanks for going &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; with us Jonathan!
