<p>This page contains a set of 'Beyond The Book' interviews conducted with several children's authors by our 2015-16 Literacy Ambassador, Matt Shenton, during his tenure.</p>

<p>Each author has been asked the same set of questions, making the interviews well-suited to comparison activities. Alternatively, they might be used as an introduction to new authors and books for both teachers and pupils.</p>
