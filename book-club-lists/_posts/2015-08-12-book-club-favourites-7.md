      A much celebrated novel about looking. You will either find this book complex and enjoyable, or deeply confusing! It’s not an easy read, but if you can get beyond the layers of the story there is a lot to reward you, including some strong female characters.

      Non-fiction title about the remarkable efforts of the inhabitants of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and the other villages of the Plateau Vivarais to save several thousand people from the concentration camps in WWII. This book was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Award in 2014. Equally there are those who say that it misrepresents the story. Judge for yourself.
