**We’ll update this page as we get further information about coronavirus from the government, NHS and Suffolk County Council.**

</div>

We’re monitoring advice from the Government, NHS and the county council and keep all staff updated on a daily basis. Library staff are aware of the ways we can reduce the risk of passing on illness, and they will also display public health notices.

If an outbreak were to occur in Suffolk this might have an effect on our libraries and their activities, the mobile service and the home library service. We will keep customers informed of any changes to opening hours and events.

- [See your library page for information on cancelled events and closures](/libraries/)
