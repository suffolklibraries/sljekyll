**We’ll update this page as we get further information about coronavirus from the government, NHS and Suffolk County Council.**

As a public-facing service we have a responsibility to consider the potential impact of the coronavirus if there was an outbreak in Suffolk. We consider the wellbeing of our customers and staff.

We’re monitoring advice from the Government, NHS and the county council and pass on relevant information to our staff. Library staff are aware of the ways we can reduce the risk of passing on illness, and they will also display public health notices.

If an outbreak were to occur in Suffolk this might have an effect on our libraries and their activities. We will keep customers informed about any changes.

Suffolk Libraries also has a role to play in ensuring people know where to access reliable and accurate information. Reliable and up to date information about the coronavirus situation is available from:

- [General information from the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/)
- [What to do if you feel you might have coronavirus: NHS 111 immediate-response COVID-19 advice service](https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19)
- [The government’s advisory service](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public)
