<h2>Code club</h2>
Code Club is a nationwide network of free, volunteer-led coding clubs aimed at children aged 9-11. Volunteers teach programming, encouraging the children to learn while using their imagination in creative projects.

Bring your own laptop or use one of our library Chromebooks. Please note tablets are not suitable for this course.

Children aged between 6-14 can take part. We ask that a grown-up stays within the library during the sessions.

Our first course is fully booked (beginning Saturday 16 January 2016, 2-3pm, for 4 consecutive Saturdays), but you can book a spot for future sessions.

<h2>Business advice</h2>
We have two <a href="http://www.newangliagrowthhub.co.uk/">New Anglia Growth Hub</a> advisors working on a fortnightly, rotating basis. They advise on topics including exporting, digital support, intellectual property, finance, grants and vouchers, and starting up a business.
