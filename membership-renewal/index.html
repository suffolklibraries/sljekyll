<h2>How your donation will help us</h2>

<p>Donations will go into a dedicated Development Fund which will be used to support and improve the work of our 44 libraries in their local communities.</p>

<p>The scheme is completely voluntary. At the end of the year we’ll ask if you’d like to sign up again.</p>

<p class="mt1"><a href="/news/sle-funding/">Read about some of the projects the Suffolk Libraries Extra scheme has supported so far &rarr;</a></p>

        <h2>What you'll get in return</h2>

        <p>All members of Suffolk Libraries Extra will get a <strong>membership card</strong> and a <strong>special newsletter</strong> with exclusive recommendations, advance notice of new library titles and exclusive offers and competitions. So far we've given away signed books, an annual family membership to English Heritage and a year's subscription to <cite>Suffolk Magazine</cite>.</p>

        <p>Platinum level members will also have the option of <strong>attending our AGM</strong> and be <strong>acknowledged in our Annual Review</strong> next year.</p>

        <p>Suffolk Libraries Extra aims to enhance the library service by funding improvements while continuing to procide the same free services and benefits.</p>

        <p>If you’d like to know more or would like help with your application, email <strong>extra@suffolklibraries.co.uk</strong></p>
