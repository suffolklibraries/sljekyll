## Joining

If you live in Suffolk or a neighbouring county complete the [online form](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BRWREG) and we&#8217;ll post your card to you.

Alternatively, visit any Suffolk Mobile library with proof of identification and we&#8217;ll give you a card.

It&#8217;s free. Children and young people up to the age of 16 need a guarantor. To use any of our online services you&#8217;ll also need a PIN. If you don&#8217;t know your PIN contact a member of staff, telephone 01473 263838 or email help@suffolklibraries.co.uk

## Costs

Books on mobile libraries can be borrowed for 8 weeks. If you don&#8217;t return a book om time we&#8217;ll apply an overdue charge. The charge rises for each mobile library visit you miss. If the mobile library is unable to call we&#8217;ll take this into account when we calculate the charge.
