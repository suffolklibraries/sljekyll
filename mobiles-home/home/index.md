The Home Library Service can be provided for anyone whose physical or mental health prevents them from visiting the branch or mobile library.

# Volunteering

Our volunteers work with library staff to regularly visit customers, providing social interaction and delivering library stock.

The minimum volunteers contribute is a morning or afternoon each month. They need access to a car, driving themselves or pairing up with another volunteer.
