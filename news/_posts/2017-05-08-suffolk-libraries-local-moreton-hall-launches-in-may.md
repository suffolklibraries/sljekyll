Suffolk Libraries is launching its third Suffolk Libraries Local session at Moreton Hall Youth Centre near Bury St Edmunds on Tuesday 16 May 2017.

Suffolk Libraries Local sessions supplement Suffolk’s network of public and mobile libraries by creating a weekly library experience in existing community venues at geographical locations not directly served by a static library. Suffolk Libraries Local has already successfully launched at [Red Lodge](/libraries/red-lodge/) and [Shotley](/libraries/shotley/).

Suffolk Libraries Local in Moreton Hall will run every Tuesday from 10:30am to 1:30pm, and residents attending these weekly sessions will be able to browse and borrow from a selection of books, attend a range of activities for all age groups and use IT facilities for research, work and pleasure. The initiative aims to enable different groups to come together to enrich the lives of residents by supporting them to lead healthier, happier and more prosperous lives.

Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries Board, said: "Suffolk Libraries Local is helping us explore new ways of extending the library service to communities in Suffolk. It’s something we are doing to support existing services, and it’s important that we are always looking to the future and how we can ensure the county’s library service meets the developing needs of the people of Suffolk. The locations selected for the pilot project have all been chosen because they are areas of increased housing development and the communities could benefit from the many services and benefits that libraries offer."

We welcome the views of the local community in shaping what activities Suffolk Libraries Local at Moreton Hall will offer by completing the [Suffolk Libraries Local Moreton Hall online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SLLMoretonhall).

The new sessions will not affect [Bury St Edmunds mobile library route 17](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/mobiles-home/bury-st-edmunds-mobile-library-route-17/), which will continue to serve various stops in the Moreton Hall area every fourth Tuesday.

Suffolk Libraries Local is initially a pilot project which will run in each of the three communities for six months. Find out more on the [Suffolk Libraries Local page](/local/).
