Live music returns to Ipswich County Library this summer with one of the best original bands in East Anglia. Norwich-based Americana outfit The Vagaband will be performing at Ipswich Library on Saturday 7 July, supported by Ipswich-based singer/songwriter Tony James Shevlin.

The Vagaband are one of the most universally likeable bands around, playing a style of music that always goes down well wherever they perform. Their music incorporates Americana, bluegrass, folk, jazz, soul, blues, rock and more. Their harmony-drenched songs are both poignant and pulsating, ranging from beautifully crafted ballads to foot-stomping folk. They have played at various festivals around the country, including Bestival, Camp Bestival and Glastonbury, as well as many venues including the much acclaimed Green Note in Camden, where they consistently sell out.

Support act Tony James Shevlin is something of a legend on the Suffolk music scene. Tony has fronted several popular bands over the years and is a highly acclaimed singer-songwriter who has enjoyed three successful US tours in recent years. His Celtic-infused Americana is a perfect match for the Vagaband and will provide a fitting start to the evening.

Daniel Harvey, communities lead with Suffolk Libraries and one of the organisers of the gig, said: “We’re really looking forward to this event; The Vagaband are a fantastic band and we’re so pleased to have secured them.”

“There’s something great about the library as a music venue – there always seems to be such a great, happy vibe in the room at the gigs we’ve put on and I’m sure this one will be just the same!”

Tickets for the gig are £8, with doors opening at 7:30pm and the first act starting at 8pm. You can [purchase tickets online](/events/ipswich-2018-07-07-vagaband/) or at the library enquiry desk.

There will be a reasonably priced bar at the event selling a selection of beer, cider, wine and soft drinks. Profits from the event will go to the Friends of Ipswich Library, a voluntary group who help and support Ipswich Library. You can find out more about the band on [The Vagaband's website](http://www.thevagaband.co.uk/).

Ipswich Library hosted several popular gigs during 2015 and 2016, with sell-out audiences of over 200 people attending shows featuring Police Dog Hogan, Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer and Primo Nelson.
