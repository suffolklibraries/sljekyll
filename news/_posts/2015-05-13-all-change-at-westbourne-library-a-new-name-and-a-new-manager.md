Westbourne Library in Ipswich will be changing its name to Broomhill Library after a consultation with local people.

The change was proposed by the Westbourne Library Friends group who felt that the library was more closely associated with the nearby Broomhill Park and that a new name would better reflect the community that the library serves.

The Friends group carried out an extensive consultation exercise with local people which resulted in nearly 80% of people voting in favour of changing the name to Broomhill Library. Their proposal was recently approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.

Westbourne Library’s name comes from the original library which was based in Richmond Road. The library moved to the current building in Sherrington Road in 1948 and many customers already refer to it as Broomhill Library.

Garath Jones, Chairman of Westbourne Library Friends said: “The proposed name change represents far more than a cosmetic change. The library is at the centre of our community, and our group is working hard to bring the community together. It’s quite a subtle change, yet it’s one which has been positively received and we believe will further strengthen the history of our area and project it to our community and beyond.”

Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries Board, said: “We were happy to endorse this change which is a great example of our community groups suggesting new ways in which their libraries can engage with local people. The new name will hopefully give the library a stronger identity and help it to reach out to more people in the area it serves.”

The change will officially take place in the summer with the aim being to formally launch ‘Broomhill Library’ at the library’s summer fete in early July.

The library will also have a new manager by the time it changes its name. David Cook who already works at the library will become the library’s new manager in May.

## Background information

The name of the library will stay as Westbourne for the next few months with a new sign and the necessary changes to the library catalogue and website will take place just before the official launch so customers do not need to do anything.

The library building has a very interesting history. It was built as an air raid shelter and gas decontamination unit during World War 2. It’s only one of a handful of these type of buildings which still survive across the country.

The building is listed and has close connections with Broomhill Park and Broomhill Pool. The library and pool building were built in the same style by engineer E McLachlan. When listing the library building English Heritage stressed the significance and rarity of two ‘sister’ buildings of the same style and period existing in such close proximity.
