Woodbridge Library is looking for staff or pupils of New Street School – which now houses the town’s library – to come forward with any memories or photographs.

The library is holding a local history fair on Saturday 12 September as part of Heritage Open Days which celebrate historic buildings. The Local History Fair will take place at the library from 10am to 4pm and will provide an opportunity for people to find out more about local history organisations and the history of the local area.

Library staff are also planning to celebrate the building’s previous life as the New Street School, inviting former pupils or teachers to come and share their memories and hopefully recording them for future reference. There will also be displays showing the history of New Street School and Woodbridge Library in its various incarnations so any old photographs would be very useful.

Woodbridge Council School in New Street opened in 1909 following the old British School in Castle Street being condemned. Woodbridge County Primary School moved from New Street to a new school building on the former school playing field on Pytches Road in 2007 with Woodbridge Library opening on its new site in 2010.

The team at Woodbridge Library would love to hear from anyone who went to the school or worked there. Do you have any memories of teachers, friends or national events which happened whilst you were there? Anyone with anything to contribute can contact Amanda Davidson at amanda.davidson@suffolklibraries.co.uk or call 01394 446510 .

Heritage Open Days is England&#8217;s biggest heritage festival celebrating the country’s fantastic history, architecture and culture. It is a once-a-year chance to discover the often hidden or forgotten gems on our doorsteps and enjoy a wide range of tours, events and activities that bring local history and culture to life.
