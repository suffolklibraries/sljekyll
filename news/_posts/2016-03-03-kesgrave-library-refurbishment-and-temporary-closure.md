Kesgrave Library will be closing for a week in April to enable extensive redecoration to take place. The library will be closed from Monday 18 April to Friday 22 April and reopening on Saturday 23 April at 10am.

The work will involve repainting the public library area, installing new shelving &#8211; which will create more storage space, cleaning the carpets and installing new blinds. The work is being paid for by a combination of the Kesgrave Library Community Group and the local Kesgrave charity SPARK.

Customers can use any other library during the closure with Rosehill and Woodbridge libraries being the closest. There are also a mobile library services in this area: [Ipswich Mobile Library Route 10](/mobiles-home/ipswich-mobile-library-route-10) will visit stops in Rushmere and Martlesham on Tuesday 19 April, and [Ipswich Mobile Library Route 12](/mobiles-home/ipswich-mobile-library-route-12) will have stops in Rushmere, Playford and Little and Great Bealings on Thursday 21 April.

Any library loans due back during the closure will be extended to the following week.
