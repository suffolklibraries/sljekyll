Framlingham Library will be closed for refurbishment from 13 - 18 May, reopening on Sunday 19 May.

The improvements will include a new counter and carpets, as well as internal repainting. This will improve the library environment for both customers and staff.

The work is being paid for by a combination of donations from the Friends of Framlingham Library, Suffolk Coastal District Council, The Mills Trust and Framlingham Town Council.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this temporary closure. Any library loans due back during the closure will be automatically extended and local residents are welcome to use any other library during the closure, the nearest being [Wickham Market](/libraries/wickham-market-library/), [Saxmundham](/libraries/saxmundham-library/), [Stradbroke](/libraries/stradbroke-library/) and [Debenham](/libraries/debenham-library/).
