Suffolk Libraries is asking customers for their views on proposed changes to the opening hours at Brandon and Long Melford libraries.

**Brandon Library** is proposing staying open an for additional hour on Wednesdays and closing one hour earlier on Fridays, so the total number of opening hours would remain the same. We are aiming for opening times that are better aligned with other services at the Brandon Centre, where the library is based, as well as more convenient for customers.

The proposed new hours at Brandon Library are:

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Wednesday - 10am - 3pm (currently 10am - 2pm)
* Thursday - 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 6pm (currently 10am - 7pm)
* Saturday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Sunday - 10am - 3pm (no change)

Customers can fill in the [Brandon Library opening hours survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Brandonlibhours) online or in the library.

**Long Melford Library** is proposing opening for six additional hours per week. Due to changes in staffing arrangements at the library, this would be at minimal cost to us. We are aiming for more consistent and longer opening hours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The library would be open on Saturdays but closed on Sundays.

The proposed new hours at Long Melford Library are:

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5:30pm)
* Wednesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5pm)
* Thursday - closed (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 7pm)
* Saturday - 9am - 1pm (currently closed)
* Sunday - closed (currently 12pm - 4:30pm)

Customers can fill in the [Long Melford Library opening hours survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Lmelfordlibrary) online or in the library.

The deadline for completing the surveys is **Friday 12 October** and any change in hours will then have to be agreed by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.
