Suffolk Libraries is marking the first Suffolk Day (Wednesday 21 June) by reflecting on the role the county has played in influencing many well-known books and holding a Suffolk-themed writing competition.

Suffolk has a fine literary tradition, so we've put together a [list of the best Suffolk-related titles](/new-suggestions/articles/titles-for-suffolk-day/), including [<cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite> by W. G. Sebald](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=224777), [<cite>We Didn't Mean to go to Sea</cite> by Arthur Ransome](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=220574) and [<cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite> by Charles Dickens](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1225506). We'd also like to draw attention to the county's vibrant literary festivals which attract world-famous speakers, and the fact that several writers have made their home here.  

We're also launching a competition for local writers. You're invited to submit your own Suffolk-inspired short story, essay or poem through our [Suffolk Writes](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/suffolk-writes/) project. The best entries will be published in a library eBook compilation which people will be able to download for free from our [eLibrary](/elibrary/). Please see below for further information on what is required and how to submit your entry.

Chief executive officer Alison Wheeler said: "We wanted to celebrate and support Suffolk Day and it seemed obvious that the best way to do this was to remind everyone of the literacy riches that our county has to offer. We’ve put together a small selection of the writers and scenes that are part of Suffolk’s literary heritage and we hope people will check out the list and rediscover some of these books at their library.

"We are very proud to have several fine writers who have made the county their home and are currently writing their own chapter in the county’s literary history. We also want to encourage the next generation of writers by inviting them to take part in our very own Suffolk Writes competition."
