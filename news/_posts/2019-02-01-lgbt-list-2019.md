This LGBT History Month, we have added lots of great new titles to our [Young Adult LGBT recommendation list](/new-suggestions/young-adult/lgbt-history-month-2019/).

According to [Stonewall UK](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/media/lgbt-facts-and-figures), nearly half (45 per cent) of LGBT pupils - including 64 per cent of trans pupils - are bullied for being LGBT in Britain's schools. Half of LGBT pupils hear homophobic slurs 'frequently' or 'often' at school. Just one in five LGBT pupils have been taught about safe sex in relation to same-sex relationships.

Suffolk Libraries customer service and marketing administrator Hannah Foulstone said: "These statistics show that there is more we can do to support young people going through troubled and confusing times."

"The new reading list is recommended to anyone who may be searching for representation, information and advice on the LGBTQ spectrum."

We recommend [Mermaids UK](https://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk/), an organisation that works with families of transgender children.
