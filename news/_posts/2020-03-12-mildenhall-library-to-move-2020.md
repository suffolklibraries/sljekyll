Mildenhall Library will be moving to the town’s new public services hub in early 2021.

The multi-million pound project will also be providing education, health and leisure facilities on one site.

Mildenhall Library is currently located in Chestnut Close and is open six days a week providing books, wifi and printing facilities to the public. It also runs weekly sessions for over 55s, baby and child groups and a monthly reading group amongst other activities. The library’s Knit and Natter group recently raised £1,150 for the local St Nicholas Hospice.

Once complete, Mildenhall Hub will bring together a new school, leisure facilities, a health centre, library, advice functions and a children’s centre, and will also house desk space for Suffolk Police, West Suffolk Council, Suffolk County Council and the NHS, including Public Health England.

The project recently celebrated a significant phase in its construction [with a topping out ceremony on site](https://www.buryfreepress.co.uk/news/matt-hancock-visits-as-mildenhall-hub-reaches-milestone-9101954/).

Bruce Leeke, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:  

“We are looking forward to moving to the ground-breaking new library space in the Mildenhall Hub. We hope that the flexible nature of the space and the fact that it’s closer to the town centre will attract new visitors to the library. Our customers will also have access to additional facilities such as a café, public toilets and baby changing and there will be better space for us to provide activities and events. All of this will combine to allow us to make life that bit better for people locally.”  

We will keep customers informed about the project as we approach the move date.
