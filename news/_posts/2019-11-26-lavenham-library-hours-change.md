Following a recent consultation with customers, [Lavenham Library](/libraries/lavenham-library/) will be increasing its opening hours from Wednesday 1 January 2020. The changes have been made following a recent consultation with customers, and have been formally approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.

The library will be open on Monday mornings, and for longer on Fridays. It will have shorter hours on Saturdays, and be closed on Sundays. The total number of opening hours will increase by an extra 0.5 hours at no cost to Suffolk Libraries due to some small changes to staffing patterns.

**The new opening times are as follows:**

* Monday - 10am - 1pm (currently closed)
* Tuesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Wednesday - closed (no change)
* Thursday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5pm)
* Saturday - 10am â€“ 2pm (currently 10am - 4pm)
* Sunday - closed (currently 12:30pm - 4pm)

Lavenham Library Manager Elise Hardy said: ""

New signage will be implemented at the library in the near future to reflect this change.

The library is holding a [Christmas wreath workshop on Tuesday 3 December](/events/lavenham-2019-12-03-wreath-making/) and a [Christmas Lego and crafts session on Saturday 14 December](/events/lavenham-2019-12-14-xmas-lego/). Some of their regular events will be changing their times or relaunching after the change in opening hours.
