Following a recent consultation with customers, [Lavenham Library](/libraries/lavenham-library/) will be increasing its opening hours from Wednesday 1 January 2020. The changes have been made following a recent consultation with customers, and have been formally approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.

The library will be open on Monday mornings, and for longer on Fridays. It will have shorter hours on Saturdays, and be closed on Sundays. The total number of opening hours will increase by an extra 0.5 hours at no cost to Suffolk Libraries due to some small changes to staffing patterns.

**The new opening times are as follows:**

* Monday - 10am - 1pm (currently closed)
* Tuesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Wednesday - closed (no change)
* Thursday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5pm)
* Saturday - 10am â€“ 2pm (currently 10am - 4pm)
* Sunday - closed (currently 12:30pm - 4pm)

Lavenham Library Manager Elise Hardy said: "We are very pleased that we have been able to increase Lavenham Library's opening hours as part of this change. It enables us to extend our service offer on Mondays and Fridays and brings our opening times more in line with other activities within Lavenham Village Hall. We have listened to our customers and will be opening at times that suit them, their families and their lifestyles."

New signage will be implemented at the library in the near future to reflect this change.

Some the library's regular events will be changing their times or relaunching after the change in opening hours.
