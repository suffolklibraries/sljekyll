Two of the county’s libraries are changing their opening hours next month after consultation with local people.

Broomhill Library in Ipswich will be changing and increasing its hours from 18 July. The change has been supported by the Friends of Broomhill Library and is being made to better suit the needs of local customers.

The change will mean that the library will be open seven days a week and will also increase opening hours by two hours a week at no additional cost by making slight changes to working patterns.

The main change is that the library will now open on a Monday from 9.30am to 12.30pm where it is currently closed. It will close earlier on a Tuesday at 5pm where it currently closes at 7pm and on Fridays it will close at 6.30pm where it currently closes at 7.30pm. It will also open a bit earlier during the week.

The new hours at Broomhill Library will be as follows:

* Mondays – 9.30am to 12.30pm (currently closed)
* Tuesdays – 9am to 5pm (opening 30 minutes earlier and closing two hours earlier)
* Wednesdays – 9.30am to 5pm (opening 30 minutes earlier)
* Thursdays – 9.30am to 5pm (opening 30 minutes earlier)
* Fridays – 9.30am to 6.30pm (opening 30 minutes earlier and closing one hour earlier)
* Saturday – 10am to 5pm (no change)
* Sundays – 11am to 4pm (no change).

The new hours are designed to help local people and increase use of the library. After consultation with customers and local organisations, the proposal to open on Mondays has been widely welcomed whereas the two later openings on Tuesday and Friday are less busy than at other times.

As Great Cornard Library is based at Thomas Gainsborough School, it currently has different opening hours for term times and holidays. From the forthcoming summer holidays, the library will be amending its opening hours outside of term time but the term time opening hours will stay the same. The only change is that the library will be open on Monday mornings but closed on Tuesday afternoons.

Statistics show that Tuesday afternoons are quieter during school holidays as the gym next door is closed and opening on Monday mornings could allow the library to run a Tot Rock session for young children during the school holidays.

From Monday 25 July Great Cornard Library’s opening hours during the holidays will be:

* Mondays – 10am to 1.30pm (currently closed)
* Tuesdays – 10am to 1pm (currently also opened 1.30pm to 5pm – meaning the library will be closed for the afternoon
* Wednesdays – closed (no change)
* Thursdays – 2pm to 7pm (no change)
* Fridays – 10am to 1pm and 1.30pm to 5pm (no change)
* Saturdays and Sundays – 10am to 3pm (no change).

Both of these changes have been consulted on with local people and have been approved by Suffolk Libraries’ Board and Suffolk County Council. They have the support of both libraries’ Friends groups and are designed to improve and increase use of the library.
