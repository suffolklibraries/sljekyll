A library service recently asked to see our self-service system in action. If you're unaware, we developed our own system in 2016 instead of buying from the traditional suppliers. It's cheaper, more portable and more user-friendly than the systems that are out there.

I've done lots of presentations to services across the UK, and I'm more than happy to bring a unit along (as I said, they _are_ very portable!) But if you're just interested in seeing what it looks like and how it works, maybe this video will do.

If you're looking to replace your current self-service system, [contact the software developers Dootrix](https://dootrix.com/verso) and they'll arrange a talk or visit with me.
