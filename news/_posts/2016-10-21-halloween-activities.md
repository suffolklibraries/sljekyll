Libraries all over Suffolk are putting on fun activities for children next week to celebrate Halloween.

## Crafts

- [Haverhill Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/haverhill-2016-10-28-book-folding-kids/) are holding a special **’Boo’ book folding session** for children on Friday 28 October. Book folding gives old books a new, decorative purpose, as the pages are reshaped to form pictures or patterns. If that sounds like something you’d like to try yourself, Haverhill are holding a [book folding session for adults on Saturday 5 November](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/haverhill-2016-11-05-book-folding/).

- At [Gainsborough Library on Saturday 29 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/gainsborough-2016-10-29-pumpkins-sat/) and [Sunday 30 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/gainsborough-2016-10-30-pumpkins-sun/), you can **carve pumpkins and make Halloween decorations**. Pumpkin numbers are limited, though, so be sure to get there before they run out.

There are also Halloween-themed craft sessions at:

- [Gainsborough Library on Monday 24 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/gainsborough-2016-10-24-halloween/).

- [Great Cornard Library on Friday 28 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/great-cornard-2016-10-28-halloween/).

- [Oulton Broad Library on Sunday 30 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/oulton-broad-2016-10-30-halloween/).

Why not bring your child to the library to make some spooky decorations for your home?

## Stories

- **Mildenhall Library** are holding special **Stories in the Dark** sessions for 2-5 year-olds at [11am](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/mildenhall-2016-10-28-stories-dark/), [12pm](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/mildenhall-2016-10-28-stories-dark-12/) and [2pm](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/mildenhall-2016-10-28-stories-dark-14/) on Friday 28 October. 2015 Suffolk Skald of the year Marion Leeper will be in the magic tent providing a multi-sensory experience as she explains who stole the darkness, why the sun and moon are high and dry in the sky, and how three monkeys came to be in a canoe.  **Be sure to book in advance, as only 15 people can fit in this tiny theatre!**

- [Haverhill Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/haverhill-2010-10-25-halloween-stories/) are encouraging children to dress up for their **Halloween-themed storytelling** session on Tuesday 25 October, and providing milk and cookies.

- The **half-term crafts** sessions at [Bury St Edmunds](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/bury-2016-10-24-half-term-crafts/) which run from 9am to 1pm each day from Monday 24 October to Saturday 29 October combine storytelling, crafts, and, intriguingly, an **unlucky dip**!

Other libraries whose Halloween sessions feature a mixture of stories, crafts and other activities are:

- [Leiston Library on Tuesday 25 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/leiston-2016-10-25-pyjama-party/).

- [Chantry Library on Thursday 27 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/chantry-2016-10-27-halloween-special/).

- [Lowestoft Library on Saturday 29 October](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/lowestoft-2016-10-29-spooky-saturday/).

## Nature

Children also have the opportunity to **meet birds and mini-beasts** at some of our libraries during half-term.  

- The [Bird of Prey Centre at Stonham Barns](http://www.stonhambarns.co.uk/suffolk-owl-sanctuary/) is holding a session at [Ipswich Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/ipswich-2016-10-25-birds-of-prey-in-the-library/) on Tuesday 25 October, offering children the opportunity to **see and learn out about their majestic creatures**. There will also be **crafts sessions** at the library on the same day.

- [Suffolk Owl Sanctuary](http://www.owl-help.org.uk/), are also visiting us from Stonham Barns. They’re at [Stowmarket Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/stowmarket-2016-10-26-suffolk-owl-sanctuary-visit/) on Wednesday 26 October.  Children can **meet a falconer and owls** from the sanctuary, and **make an owl or Halloween item** courtesy of the Friends of Stowmarket Library.

- Also on Wednesday 26 October, butterflies of Britain are at [Lowestoft Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/lowestoft-2016-10-26-creepy-crawlies/) for **Halloween-themed mini-beast crafts, activities and fun**. We recommend that you book in advance.

- Although there won’t be any animals present, [Kessingland Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/kessingland-2016-10-28-fishy-crafts/)’s **Fishy Crafts and Fishy Tales** session on Friday 28 October is worth a visit. In celebration of the area’s heritage, children will hear fish-themed stories and make fish-themed crafts.

## Something a bit different

- On the spooky/mystical theme, [Hadleigh Library](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/hadleigh-2016-10-25-harry-potter-night/) are holding what looks to be a fantastic **<cite>Harry Potter</cite>-** themed night on Tuesday 25 October.  For £5 your child can make their own wand and a Hogwarts school hat, and enjoy a <cite>Harry Potter</cite>-themed area with props. There’s also a **free <cite>Harry Potter</cite> creature competition and optional extras**; see the event page for full details.

- Children in [Stowmarket](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events/southwold-2016-10-25-meet-catherine-pearson/) have the opportunity to partake in **activities led by Catherine Pearson, author of Southwold-based children’s book <cite>The Sole Bay Railway</cite>**. This sounds like a really exciting book, so this event is bound to be special.

Hopefully, with all these activities, you won’t have to hear the dreaded strains of ‘I’m bored!’.
