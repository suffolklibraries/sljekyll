<p>Are you looking for something to do during the Easter holidays? We've got loads of children's events happening across our libraries.</p>

<p>Easter holiday highlights include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Performances and screenings</li>
    <li>Beachcombing activities from Beach Bonkers</li>
    <li>Easter egg hunts</li>
    <li>Storytime and craft activities</li>
</ul>

<p>April also marks <a href="/news/childrens-month/">Suffolk Libraries Children's Month</a>. We're celebrating everything our libraries offer children and young people, from events to brilliant books to arts and wellbeing activities. We're revealing our libraries' favourite children's books and asking you to tell us yours for the chance to win an iPad.</p>
