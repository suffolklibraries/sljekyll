Halesworth library manager Julie Gulliver will be skydiving on Sunday 12 April to raise funds for the county's library service.

Julie has raised £250 so far. All funds raised minus the cost of the skydive will go directly to Suffolk Libraries, which is an independent charitable organisation contracted to run the county’s 44 libraries, including Halesworth Library.

Julie has worked for Suffolk's library service since 2008 and later became part of Suffolk Libraries when the service was transferred from the county council in 2012. She became manager of Halesworth Library in August last year after the previous manager, [Ali Hopkins](/news/ali-hopkins-halesworth-garden/), passed away.

Julie said: "Having recently reached fifty and having a fear of heights, I thought that I would try to do some things that would take me out of my comfort zone. This certainly will!

It's no secret that libraries face many challenges and I wanted to do a little something to help to raise awareness and raise funds. Our communities need libraries now more than ever."

Nikki Hulse, Business Development Manager for Suffolk Libraries, said: "Libraries are so important for tackling social isolation and improving the wellbeing of our communities. Anyone can help us carry on our work by donating to us through our website or by following Julie’s example and fundraising for their local libraries. It is our hope that Julie’s daring challenge will make people consider Suffolk Libraries if they are looking to fundraise for a local cause."

You can sponsor Julie's skydive via her [GoldenGiving page](https://www.goldengiving.com/f/julieskydive). You can also donate to Suffolk Libraries directly through our [Support Us page](/support-us/)
