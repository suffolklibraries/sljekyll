Libraries across Suffolk are hosting wellbeing-focussed events and activities throughout January 2020 to help people improve their mindfulness and everyday wellbeing.

As part of our first ever wellbeing campaign, [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), we've partnered with [Wellbeing Suffolk](https://www.wellbeingnands.co.uk/suffolk/) to hold free wellbeing drop-ins and workshops across our libraries. The drop-ins offer the opportunity to chat about wellbeing with others over a hot drink, while the workshops aim to improve your mindfulness and everyday wellbeing.

Libraries are also holding additional wellbeing-related events. These include an evening with author Michelle Thomas at Woodbridge Library on Saturday 18 January. Michelle's book, <cite>My Sh*t Therapist and other mental health stories</cite>, is an honest and entertaining account of living with mental illness. It’s also a great time to make a resolution to check out the groups and activities libraries offer year-round that can improve your wellbeing, such as [activities for older people](/events-activities/older/) and [reading groups](/events-activities/reading-groups/).

Sarah Lungley, Mental Health and Wellbeing Coordinator at Suffolk Libraries, said: "We are thrilled to be launching our very first wellbeing month campaign, Jumpstart January. The festive season and following weeks can be a difficult time for many people and we want everyone in Suffolk to know that their libraries can be there to help.

"[Recent independent research](/news/impact-report-published/) on a selection of regular Suffolk Libraries activities has found they reduce isolation and improve wellbeing, especially for parents and people experiencing mental health issues. It’s a fantastic opportunity for us to celebrate this and all that we do to support wellbeing."

You can find out more, see what's on at your local library and book on to events via our [Jumpstart January page](/jumpstart-january/).
