Extensive redecoration and refurbishment work at Sudbury Library is due to end in January, but there will be temporary changes to access while the final work is completed.

The work has been ongoing for some time and has involved full external redecoration and the removal and refurbishment of lighting so that the roof covering could be upgraded and repaired.

Sudbury Library is based in the town’s previous Corn Exchange building which was built in 1841 and is a listed building. The extensive work had to be planned and carried out very carefully and with the approval of Historic England.

There will be one final bit of disruption when a new screen is added to the entrance which is designed to keep heat in during winter months. There will also be some other related improvements to the entrance area. This means customers will notice further work being carried out when they visit the library from early January. On Monday 11 and Tuesday 12 January the front entrance is likely to be closed to public access.

The library will remain open while the front entrance is out of action. Customers will be able to access the library using an alternative entrance on Station Road next to the Salvation Army which will be clearly signposted.

We apologise for any inconvenience during the work and for customers’ ongoing patience. For safety reasons scaffolding was in place for several months but this has not affected the library’s services or activities. The work has been extensive and was vital to protect the integrity of the building which is a cherished part of the town’s heritage.
