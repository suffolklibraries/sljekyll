Two Ipswich Town legends and a former Olympian will be helping to launch our new [Sporting Memories](/events-activities/sporting-memories/) groups at [Ipswich County Library on Tuesday 6 February at 2pm](/events/ipswich-2018-02-06-sporting-memories-launch/).

Roger Osborne and George Burley from the 1978 FA Cup winning Ipswich Town team will be attending the launch and sharing their recollections of the day. Former Olympian Professor Bill Tancred MBE who lives locally will also be sharing stories from his sporting career.

The new groups will be running regularly at Hadleigh, Ipswich County, Lowestoft, Newmarket, Stowmarket and Sudbury Libraries. They offer anyone over the age of 50 the chance to revisit memories and share stories of taking part in or witnessing sporting events and make new friends.

The sessions also involve viewing and handling memorabilia from local and national collections, games, quizzes and gentle activities. All kinds of sport are up for discussion and people experiencing dementia, depression and loneliness are especially welcome.

The launch event is open to everyone, and we particularly encourage anyone who is interested in joining one of the new groups or volunteering to support them to come along. Guests are also encouraged to share their own sporting memories, photos or memorabilia on the day.

The event will include an introduction to the new groups and some activities, including tasters of gentle games such as boccia, a spot the ball competition and a quiz. Attendees also have the opportunity to view a special display of archive material from Ipswich Town Football Club’s history curated by Liz Edwards, the club’s supporter liaison officer. The display is currently available to view at any time inside the entrance to the library.

Councillor Tony Goldson, Suffolk County Council’s Cabinet Member for Health and Alison Wheeler, chief executive of Suffolk Libraries will be opening the event. The East of England Co-op are also supporting the project by providing free tea at the launch and group sessions. They will also be offering the chance to win a pair of matchday tickets.
