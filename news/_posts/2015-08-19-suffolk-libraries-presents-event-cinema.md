Suffolk Libraries, in partnership with [Creative Arts East](http://www.creativeartseast.co.uk/), has announced new events as part of the innovative new project which is bringing quality theatre and exhibition events to Suffolk communities using the latest digital screening equipment.

[Suffolk Libraries Presents&#8230;](/events-activities/presents/) is an Arts Council England funded project which is being run in seven of the county’s libraries with the aim of bringing more Suffolk residents into contact with the arts in a familiar and accessible local venue.

Nationally and internationally acclaimed performance and exhibition events, which have been digitally recorded, will be screened using the latest projection equipment in Stradbroke, Felixstowe, Ixworth, Gainsborough, Hadleigh, Lowestoft and Capel St Mary libraries. Examples of the performances expected to be on offer between September 2015 – April 2017 include the Globe Theatre’s productions of Julius Caesar and The Comedy of Errors; well-known ballets such as Matthew Bourne’s Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake; and unique, commentated tours of visual art exhibitions featuring artists such as Matisse, Rembrant and Van Gogh.

Hedley Swain, Area Director for Arts Council England South East, said:

> Libraries are at the centre of local community life so provide great locations for artistic performances and exhibitions. We are incredibly pleased to be supporting this project that will bring high quality artistic experiences to new audiences.

Tony Brown, chair of Suffolk Libraries, said:

> This project will help us to develop the role of our libraries as centres for cultural, social and learning experiences and hopefully encourage people to visit the library. Some people may be put off experiencing the arts in traditional, formal settings but the library may provide a more familiar and comfortable environment for them to enjoy the arts. New technology is also giving us the opportunity to deliver these experiences in new and exciting ways.

**Notes to editor**

* **Funding:** The project has been funded by a grant of £99,000 awarded to Suffolk Libraries by Arts Council England (ACE) in 2014. The money has been granted through ACE’s ‘Grants for the Arts’ scheme which is a lottery-funded programme to support activities to engage people in creative arts activities and help artists and arts organisations carry out their work.
* **Suffolk Libraries project aims:** Suffolk Libraries have teamed up with Creative Arts East who are using their rural touring and cinema expertise to help put together a programme of events with the potential to attract and ‘wow’ audiences.
    * It is one of Suffolk Libraries’ key priorities to bring cultural experiences to people, particularly those who may be unlikely to otherwise access them. Libraries are seen as familiar community spaces so some people may prefer to visit the library for their first experience of these type of performances.
    * With this project Suffolk Libraries hopes to help to introduce new audiences to the arts and also show them the increasing variety of events and experiences their library can offer.
    * The project, through the programming and screening of arts events, also aims to establish links between communities and arts organisations in order to increase access to, and awareness of, the arts.
* **About Creative Arts East:** Creative Arts East is an arts and community development charity which focuses on engaging those communities or its members who face geographical, physical or other barriers to participating in the cultural life of their area in high quality, stimulating arts and cultural activities. The charity works across Norfolk, Suffolk and the wider eastern region with regular activities such as Creative Arts East Live! &#8211; a rural touring scheme for professional live performance events, and Village Screen &#8211; a touring cinema scheme for rural communities, alongside a portfolio of projects that involve people in cultural education, improve health and well-being and assist in the development of community volunteers. Creative Arts East is an Arts Council funded National Portfolio Organisation.
