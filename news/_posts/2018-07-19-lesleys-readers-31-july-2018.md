Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>The History of Bees</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2201087), by Maja Lunde:

> "This dazzling and ambitious literary debut follows three generations of beekeepers from the past, present and future, weaving a spellbinding story of their relationship to the bees - and to their children and one another - against the backdrop of an urgent, global crisis.."
