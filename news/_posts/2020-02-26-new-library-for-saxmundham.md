People in the Saxmundham area can look forward to improved library facilities. The library will soon be moving into temporary accommodation while the current building is completely remodelled, providing a more modern and much bigger library space for local people.

The current site on Street Farm Road is being redeveloped by Suffolk County Council. Once remodelled, the new library will be twice as big as the current one, providing much more room for events and activities.

The library will be moving into a portacabin for several months so people can continue to access the library service during the work. It will be **closed for one day on Tuesday 10 March, before reopening on Wednesday  11 March in its temporary home further down Street Farm Road (opposite Fromus Veterinary Group)**. The new library is due to open in the autumn.

Saxmundham will be one of three new libraries likely to open in Suffolk in 2020, with Mildenhall Library moving to the new Mildenhall Hub later in the year and Needham Market getting a new library as part of the development of the current site. A new Eye Library also opened in early 2019.

Bruce Leeke, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:

"It’s really exciting to be getting ready for another brand new library building in Suffolk, with two more to follow later this year. This is in contrast to other parts of the country which are sadly losing libraries. We’re very grateful to Suffolk County Council for their ongoing commitment to the library service in providing this new facility.

"I know there’ll be a bit of disruption for local people initially but I’m sure they and our staff will see the benefits in a few months' time. The new library will be able to offer much more to local people, with services and activities which we know make such a positive difference to local communities."

Space in the portacabin will be limited, so events and activities that normally take place in the library will be held at Sax'cess House (the former Barclays building). The amount of library stock on display will naturally be more limited, but customers will still be able to request items either in the library or online, which they can then collect as usual. Opening hours will remain the same.

During the one-day closure people can also use any other library, with the nearest being [Leiston](/libraries/leiston-library/), [Aldeburgh](/libraries/aldeburgh-library/) or [Framlingham](/libraries/framlingham-library/). As the stock available at Saxmundham will be limited during the work, customers are also welcome to visit these libraries at any time if they wish.

We apologise for any inconvenience to customers. We have worked with the county council to minimise the impact as much as possible and the end result will be a much-improved library facility.
