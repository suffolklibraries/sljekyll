Suffolk Libraries is looking for someone to represent the views and interests of young people in the future development of the organisation.

The new young trustee would join the Suffolk Libraries Board, which helps to oversee the running of the organisation and makes key decisions on the future strategy and shape of the county’s library service.

The opportunity is open to anyone aged 18-30 who is interested in getting involved and is prepared to commit a few hours to attending Board meetings, which take place roughly five times a year.

Bruce Leeke, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:

“Suffolk Libraries is always looking ahead and we want to make sure the library service remains relevant to people throughout their lives. Our Board is a fantastic group of committed volunteers but we’d like to include more diversity and representation from key customer groups. We’re already working more closely with younger people through [our arts programme](/bloc/) and this is an ideal opportunity for a young person to make a real difference and give their generation a voice.”

Many other charities in Suffolk have seen the benefits of recruiting a young shadow trustee and the role would help to develop leadership and communication skills and gain some great experience of the voluntary and public sector.

Anyone wishing to volunteer is invited to contact Janet Perry at Community Action Suffolk at **janet.perry@communityactionsuffolk.org.uk** by **Friday 20 March**.
