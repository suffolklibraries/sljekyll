Many of our libraries have released initial details of the events and activities they plan to hold on and around the first ever [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) on Saturday 12 October.

Suffolk Libraries Day is designed to generate support and awareness of Suffolk’s library service and its impact on the county. It takes place at the end of National Libraries Week and will see special events take place at all 44 of our libraries, with the aim of showcasing everything they have to offer the community. The day will also raise funds to support the service.

Suffolk Libraries business development manager Nikki Hulse said: "We’re thrilled at the creativity and dedication of our staff to run such a range of fun and diverse events. Like our library spaces, there’s something for everyone and we hope that they encourage people to see what libraries have to offer and show why we need the public's support."

During the week leading up to Suffolk Libraries Day, a [Book Journey Challenge](/suffolk-libraries-day/book-journey/) will also take place, with Suffolk businesses coming together to get the book from Bungay to Haverhill, visiting all of the county’s libraries in between.

Full details of all the events will soon be confirmed and posted on our [Suffolk Libraries Day page](/suffolk-libraries-day/). You can also visit [your local library](/libraries/) to find out more
