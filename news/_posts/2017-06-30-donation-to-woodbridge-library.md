The Seckford Foundation has donated £1,000 to create a new permanent collection of informative books for young people at Woodbridge Library. The donation is in recognition of former Farlingaye High School headteacher Sue Hargadon, who retired last year after almost 20 years of outstanding contribution to the school and wider community.

The Sue Hargadon Collection for Young People includes fiction and non-fiction titles. The books cover a wide range of subjects relating to personal issues and wellbeing including mental health, cookery, LGBT issues, being a young carer, career support and university guides. The selection was recommended by Sue Hargadon and will be maintained by Woodbridge Library for future generations.

Helen Scrivener, Woodbridge Library manager, said: "I would like to thank Sue Hargadon and the Seckford Foundation for the opportunity to have this special book collection at Woodbridge Library. We have a diverse range of titles in the collection that will offer help and advice to young people, which will really enhance the selection of books we already have on offer here."

Graham Watson, director of the Seckford Foundation, said: "We are very pleased to offer this donation to Woodbridge Library in recognition of Sue’s outstanding contribution to education. We are also delighted that the town now has a brilliant local resource for young people who are looking for help, information and guidance on a number of areas. It is the Foundation’s aim to support young people to access important opportunities, resources and services, which enable them to flourish in education and beyond."

As a charity, the Seckford Foundation is committed to promoting and supporting the education and care of the young and elderly in and around Woodbridge and Suffolk. For more information, visit the [Seckford Foundation website](http://www.seckford-foundation.org.uk).
