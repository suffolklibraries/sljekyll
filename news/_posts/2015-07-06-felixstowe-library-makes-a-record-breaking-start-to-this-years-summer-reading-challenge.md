Felixstowe Library will be getting ready for this year’s summer reading challenge by hosting a record attempt and demonstration by Dean Gould, founder and president of Record Holders Republic tomorrow (Tuesday 7 July) at 10am.

Dean lives in Felixstowe and holds nearly 40 world records himself including beermat flipping/catching, brick flipping, coin snatching and pancake tossing/flipping.

He will be inspiring visiting children from nearby Langer Primary School by attempting to set new records as part of the World Record Holders Republic’s World Record Organisation Cup which involves people from the UK and US competing as a team against India, Georgia and Indonesia to achieve the most World Records from 26 June until 31 July.

The Summer Reading Challenge is a major literacy campaign organised by The Reading Agency which gets underway in all the county’s libraries on Saturday (11 July). The aim is to encourage 4-11 year olds to read six library books throughout the summer holidays to maintain reading skills and it’s also a great way of introducing them to their local library.

This year the theme is ‘Record Breakers’ and there’ll be a series of collectable incentives and rewards for children. Suffolk Libraries is hoping this year’s campaign will itself break records. For the last two years the county has seen increasing numbers of children taking part every year with a record-breaking 7,800 in 2013 and then a new record of over 8,000 in 2014.

Children can sign up to take part from this Saturday (11 July) onwards in their local library – it’s totally free to join in. There will be related activities running across the county’s libraries throughout the summer holidays.
