Barclays is working with Suffolk Libraries to offer basic banking services at Aldeburgh Library on Mondays from 9am-1pm. The service is currently running as a three-month trial to be reviewed at the end of August.

Customers can visit a Barclays' Moment Banker in a private office in the library for general banking tasks such as opening accounts, transferring funds, printing statements, changing addresses and booking appointments with mortgage and financial planning specialists.

The service does not include the facility to pay in cheques or withdraw or pay in cash, but customers who need to do so can use their nearest Post Office or Barclays branch.

Barclays is also planning to run Tea and Teach events at the library, where people can learn a range of digital skills from Barclays' Digital Eagles. These informal and friendly sessions will help people get to grips with online banking, Skype, email, online shopping, paying utility bills online, social media, choosing strong passwords and avoiding becoming victims of fraud. Anyone who is interested in learning or enhancing these skills can put their name down during the Monday sessions.

Chris Channell, Barclays market manager for Norfolk and Suffolk, said: "We are really excited to be working with Suffolk Libraries in Aldeburgh and look forward to seeing how we can connect with the local community through this new access point."

Nikki Hulse, business development manager at Suffolk Libraries, added: "We are very pleased to be working with Barclays to help local people access local banking services and advice. Libraries are ideal places to host services like this as we have a county-wide network of 44 different sites in local communities which are easy to access throughout the week. Weâ€™re always happy to hear from anyone with innovative ideas like this and hope the trial sessions with Barclays are a great success."
