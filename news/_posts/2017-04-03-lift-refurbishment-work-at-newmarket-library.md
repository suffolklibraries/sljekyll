The lift at Newmarket Library will be out of service for two weeks from Monday 24 April to 8 May as essential work is carried out to replace and refurbish it.

During this time, the library will be open as usual but there will be no step-free access to the library. During the first week, access to the first floor will be provided via an alternative staircase to the left of the library entrance.

This will mean at times the noise levels may be higher than usual and the libraryâ€™s Top Time, Baby Bounce and Tot Rock groups will not be running during the work as some older people and people with pushchairs may find it difficult to get to the library.

There will be a small selection of stock available for people to browse and borrow in the downstairs foyer and library staff will be on hand to help people access reserved items or other library stock.  The Shopmobility service will be available as usual.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers. The work is essential and has been scheduled to cause the minimum amount of disruption to people. Anyone with any concerns about using the library during this period can speak to a member of staff before the work takes place or call the library on [01638 661216](tel:01638661216).
