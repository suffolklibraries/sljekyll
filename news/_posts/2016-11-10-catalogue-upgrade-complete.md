We have finished upgrading our [online library catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk) and you can now make reservations and place inter-library loans as normal.

We would like to thank our customers for their understanding and patience during the upgrade period.

You will notice that the catalogue interface has changed. It is now more responsive and works better on mobile phones and tablets. Please bear with us while we iron out any problems with the new system. If you encounter any difficulties using the catalogue, please call us on <a href="tel:01473 263838">01473 263838</a> or email us at help@suffolklibraries.co.uk.
