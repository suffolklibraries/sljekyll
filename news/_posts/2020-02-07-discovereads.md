Suffolk Libraries is launching a new reading promotion which aims to get people to read something a bit different. [Discovereads](/discovereads/) is an exciting new project featuring six books handpicked by our librarians, with the help of reading groups across the county.

We're encouraging customers to step out of their reading comfort zone and borrow, read and discuss the books. You can reserve them from [our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH?HOMEPRMS=GENPARAMS) and the full collections will be on display at [Brandon](/libraries/brandon-library/), [Bungay](/libraries/bungay-library/), [Felixstowe](/libraries/felixstowe-library), [Stowmarket](/libraries/stowmarket-library/) and [Sudbury](/libraries/sudbury-library/) libraries.

Discovereads will launch on Wednesday 11 March at Stowmarket library with a [special event featuring Stella Tillyard, author of <cite>The Great Level</cite>](/events//stowmarket-2020-03-11-stella-tillyard/), one of the chosen books.

The six Discovereads books are as follows:

* [<cite>I Am, I Am, I Am</cite>, by Maggie O'Farrell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2374796)
* [<cite>The Graveyard Book</cite>, by Neil Gaiman & Chris Riddell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=45294)

Lisa Brennan, Content and Reader Development Librarian at Suffolk Libraries, said:

"We’re delighted to be launching a promotion of these six amazing books chosen with help from our book groups across Suffolk. We’d love people to take part and discover something new. You don’t have to be a regular reader or library customer – we’d love to engage with as many people as possible."

The programme will run until the end of May, with other events and discussions also taking place. [Anyone feeding back their views on the Discovereads titles by Tuesday 30 June will also be entered into a prize draw to win paperback copies of all six books](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/discovereads/competition-entry/).
