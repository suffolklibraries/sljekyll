Chantry Library has now reopened on Sundays.

The library had been closed on Sundays since Christmas. This was a temporary measure to enable us to work with staff and other organisations to tackle some persistent anti-social behaviour issues which seemed to be worse on Sundays.

We apologise to customers for any inconvenience during the time the library has been closed and appreciate their patience and ongoing support for the library.

Chantry Library also now has a new telephone number: [01473 927275](tel:01473 927275).
