Chantry Library will be closed on Sundays 24 and 31 December and 7, 14 and 21 January.

This is a temporary measure while we work out how best to manage some anti-social behaviour issues which have escalated in recent weeks. Opening times on other days are unaffected.

We apologise for any inconvenience but feel this move is in the best interests of customers and staff, whose wellbeing is always our first priority. We hope that closing for a few Sundays, the day the problem has been worst, will help the situation and allow us to work with staff and other organisations on potential solutions.

Libraries are warm and welcoming places which are open to everyone and from time to time some visitors to the library act in a way which is detrimental to staff and other customers. We always take these issues very seriously and know from past experience that closing a library at certain times or on certain days for a short time can help to alleviate the issues.

The monthly health walk which starts from outside the library on 7 January will still be going ahead as usual.
