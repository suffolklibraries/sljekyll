Suffolk Libraries chief executive Alison Wheeler has been awarded an MBE in the New Year’s Honours List 2018.

The MBE is being awarded to Alison in recognition of her significant contribution to Suffolk’s library service.

[Alison is retiring from her position in February 2018](/news/suffolk-libraries-ceo-to-retire/). She has been CEO of Suffolk Libraries since the library service was transferred from the County Council in 2012. She has lived and worked in Suffolk for over 38 years since qualifying as a librarian in 1979 after studying at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth. Since then she’s worked as a children’s librarian, managed branch libraries and eventually became the lead manager for frontline library services in 2001. In 2003 she oversaw the introduction of Sunday opening across all the county’s libraries and the first self-service equipment.

Alison has also worked at regional and national levels to develop partnerships and profile for public libraries. In the late 1990s she set up and led a regional agency for libraries in the East of England, and in 2009 she led the development and signing of a national agreement between the Department of Health and the public library sector.

Alison said “I am thrilled to be honoured in this way, and regard this as a well-earned compliment to all the people I have worked with over the years and all the supporters of Suffolk’s libraries.”

The New Year’s Honours recognise outstanding achievement or service to the community. They are awarded every year on 1 January by Her Majesty The Queen.
