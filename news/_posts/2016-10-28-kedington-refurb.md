Kedington Library reopened on 25 October after a week of redecoration.

The library is based at Kedington’s Community Centre and has been working with the Parish Council and Kedington Community Association to complement the ongoing improvements to the Community Centre. The library now has a new pathway and doors leading into the redecorated bright and accessible space.

The work has also involved new carpets and replacement shelving. The new doors are next to a new garden area which is in progress and will be a nice relaxing space for visitors to the library.

As well as some developer funds the project has also received £1,000 from local county councillor Tony Brown and £500 from District Councillor Karen Richardson. The project has also been supported by the Kedington Library Friends and a local resident has also donated items of furniture.

Kedington Library also recently launched a new scheme lending iPads to customers. The first event at the library following the refurbishment is a Teddy Bears' picnic on Thursday 10 November at 4pm. Young children are welcome to bring their teddy to the regular storytime session to mark the launch of the new <cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure activity book</cite>.

Dawn Bamford, Manager of Kedington library, said: "We're very grateful to everyone who has supported this project which has made the library more accessible, brighter and more colourful.  I'm delighted with the end result and I hope people will come along and visit the library to see the it - particularly as we've lots of new books to lend too.”
