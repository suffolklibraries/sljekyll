We'd really appreciate your feedback on our eBook and eAudio download services. These are:

* Overdrive eBooks and eAudio
* Borrowbox eAudio
* 3M eBooks

We already know that some of our services have more content available than others. What we would really like your help with is feedback on **how you find using each of our services**.

**[Complete our eBook and eAudio feedback survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SL-eLibrary)**.

If there is a service you've not used before please just answer "No" to the first question on the page about your usage and move to the next page/service.

Everyone who completes the survey (excluding Suffolk Libraries staff) will be entered into a **prize draw to win a £50 Love2shop voucher**.

You have until Thursday the 1 September 2016 to complete the survey and the winner of the prize draw will be contacted on Friday 2 September.
