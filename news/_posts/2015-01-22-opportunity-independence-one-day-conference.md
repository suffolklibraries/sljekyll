Opportunity & Independence is a one day conference looking at Suffolk Libraries’ unique independent community model, which offers a way forward for library services.

It’s for senior library service and council staff who want to find out how we’ve moved from a council service to a community based, independent model.

You’ll meet board members, library staff, partner organisations and council staff.

We’ll also discuss our market research into the future of libraries and 2020 strategy.
