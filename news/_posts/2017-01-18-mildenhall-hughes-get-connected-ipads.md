Lakenheath Library is teaming up with Hughes Electrical to provide a special Get Connected event on Saturday 4 February to launch their new iPad lending scheme.

The event is free and will run from 10.30am to 12.30pm. Get Connected events are designed to provide people with advice on how to make the most of tablets, eReaders and smart phones.

The library will also be the latest in Suffolk to launch a scheme which will give customers the opportunity to borrow and test drive an iPad. The library has two iPad minis which people will be able to borrow for free for up to three weeks. The iPads have been funded by West Suffolk Council and supplied by Hughes Electrical.

 The event is also a great opportunity for anyone to come along and get advice on how to make the most of their own device or on buying a new one. It’s also a great way to find out more about the wide range of online services available from Suffolk Libraries including eBooks, eMagazines, eAudio books and free music. Tech engineers from Hughes Electrical, as well as community group volunteers and library staff will be on hand during the event to provide information. It’s an ideal event for anyone wanting to get more out of their device or thinking of buying a new one. Refreshments will also be provided on the day.
