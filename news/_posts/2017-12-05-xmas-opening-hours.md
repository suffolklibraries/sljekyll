Our libraries will be closed on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, 27 December and New Year's Day, with half-day opening on Christmas Eve.

Our Christmas Eve opening times vary from library to library, so check [your local library's page](/libraries/) to find out their exact opening hours.

Remember that our online services are always open. You can [log in to our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH?HOMEPRMS=GENPARAMS) with your library card number and PIN to check and renew your loans and place reservations. You can also borrow eBooks and eAudiobooks, download eMagazines and stream music through our [eLibrary](/elibrary/).

If you're not sure what to read or listen to next, our stock team are always adding new themed eBook and eAudiobook collections to our [OverDrive](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/) and [BorrowBox](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/mainPage.html?b2bSite=4172) platforms. You can also find lists of our best new eAudio arrivals in our [Audiobooks section](/new-suggestions/audiobooks/).
