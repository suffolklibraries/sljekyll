We will be kicking off National Libraries week by turning several libraries into Fun Palaces this weekend (Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 October).

Fun Palaces are the brainchild of author Stella Duffy, who strongly believes that in lots of different ways “everyone is an artist and everyone is a scientist and we are all geniuses”. Each October, community venues hold Fun Palace events to enable everyone to explore their creative and scientific side and also have lots of fun. Activities available to try at our Fun Palaces range from simple crafts to science experiments to learning new instruments and languages and even belly dancing and historical re-enactment.

We are joining in with over 300 Fun Palaces across the UK and globally, all set to erupt with free and fun activities, celebrating culture in our community – and everyone is invited! This is the first time Suffolk Libraries have taken part and Stella Duffy herself will be visiting some of the events on Sunday.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: “We’re really excited to be transforming our libraries into Fun Palaces which is a perfect way to kick off National Libraries Week and show the diverse range of activities and experiences which libraries can offer. We’re also particularly grateful to Ipswich Borough Council for their funding for the Ipswich Library events which will also allow us to provide more activities in the future.”

All the events are free and open to all ages. Follow the links below for further information about the Fun Palace at your local library.
