Suffolk Libraries is pleased to announce that the 24th annual Suffolk Libraries Book Mastermind competition has been launched, thanks to the support of the [Suffolk Book League](http://www.sbl.org.uk/).

The quest to find the county’s next Book Mastermind champion has now begun, with 22 secondary schools across Suffolk taking part in the early rounds of the competition.

The challenge is designed to test how well secondary school students know their favourite books, as well as their general knowledge. Young people will then represent their school at one of three area finals in March 2019, with the top scoring contestants going through to the county final in May.

The current ‘Book Mastermind’ is [Katy Shaw from Thurston Community College](/news/book-mastermind-2018/), who won the competition in 2018. The Suffolk Book League have again provided sponsorship for the event.

Krystal Vittles, head of service delivery at Suffolk Libraries, said: "We are very grateful to the Suffolk Book League for their support which means we are able to run this competition for an amazing 24th consecutive year.

"It’s a fun but competitive event which many young people across the county take part in and is a great way of getting them to think about books and test their general knowledge."
