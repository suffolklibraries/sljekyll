Suffolk Libraries will be officially introducing its exciting [new arts programme](/arts/) at a special event at Ipswich County Library next Thursday evening (2 August).

The event is part of a week-long ‘Culture Lab’ where ten Suffolk artists will explore different media with the theme of Arts in the Community. It offers an opportunity to meet the artists and find out about their work. It will also be the first chance to hear the programme’s new name and how we worked with young people to come up with branding they could identify with.

[The event is free and takes place on Thursday 2 August from 7pm to 9pm](/events/ipswich-2018-08-02-culture-lab/). Anyone is welcome but as space is limited, please contact Suffolk Libraries arts programmes coordinator Melissa Matthews at **arts@suffolklibraries.co.uk** if you would like to come.

[As of April 2018, we have National Portfolio Status](/news/national-portfolio-organisation/), which was awarded to six library services by Arts Council England last year. National Portfolio Status means the Arts Council considers an organisation is doing work of national significance. They awarded us over £700,000 to carry out this work over four years.

As part of Year 1 of the programme, we have invited ten local artists to take over Ipswich County Library for a week to explore the role creativity plays as a catalyst for nurturing confidence and wellbeing in young people. The residency will run from next Monday (30 July) and will also explore the role of the arts in the community and provide the artists with a chance to develop their own ideas and practice. We are also encouraging the artists to visit, learn about and creatively respond to the communities which surround our other libraries on a ‘Library Safari’.

Bruce Leeke, chief executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: “Libraries at their heart are community spaces and they can offer somewhere where everyone can access culture and the arts. We’re all incredibly excited to see the programme progressing well and I’m hoping that giving it a name and a brand that young people will identify with will help us to enthuse and engage even more people as the it develops.”

Suffolk Libraries arts programmes coordinator Melissa Matthews added: “We decided we wanted our first artist residency to explore the role of arts in the community and how being creative can be used as a catalyst for bringing communities together and to support wellbeing in young people (11–25 years).

“We were keen for the focus to represent the range of creative community activities which libraries now offer, so our ten artists are from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, from a digital sound artist through to writers and illustrators.”
