Several libraries in the west of the county have teamed up to launch a project to turn April into MAPril!

Staff from Clare, Glemsford, Great Cornard, Kedington and Sudbury libraries who run Sunday craft sessions for children have come up with an idea to create a colourful map of their local area.

The aim is for children visiting these libraries during April to contribute their ideas and drawings and to add in important places in their town or village to create colourful 3D maps of the place they live.

Any local children can come along to these libraries on the following Sundays &#8211; 3, 10, 17 and 24 April to take part.

The Sunday craft sessions where children can take part in the map project are running as follows:

  * Clare Library &#8211; 11.30am to 1.30pm
  * Great Cornard Library &#8211; 11am to 2pm (children will be able to add to it at other times during the holidays)
  * Glemsford Library – 12pm to 2pm
  * Kedington Library – 2pm to 4pm
  * Sudbury Library – 10.30am to 12noon
