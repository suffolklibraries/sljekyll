We won the Digital category award at this year’s [EDGE library conference](http://edgeconference.co.uk/) in Edinburgh for our series of “Get Connected” events.

The awards recognise innovative library and information projects which demonstrate the benefits of library services to communities.

At the events we provide advice on our online services, such as free wifi, ebook loans and free MP3s and streaming. Anyone can come along with their tablet, phone or ereader so they can get the services set up.

## Services we offer

  * [Free wifi at over 30 branches](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/help/using-wifi-in-libraries/ "Using wifi in libraries")
  * [Over 6000 ebooks to borrow](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/)
  * [3 million songs to download or stream](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/)
