October will be a busy month for Suffolk Libraries with a series of events for Silver Sunday, Get Online Week, National Libraries Week and Fun Palaces.

This Sunday (1 October) is **Silver Sunday**, a national day of fun and free activities for older people to celebrate their contributions to our communities and combat loneliness and isolation. Five libraries are holding Silver Sunday events:

* [Afternoon tea at Beccles Library](/events/beccles-2017-10-01-silver-sunday/)
* [Health walk from Chantry Library, in Ipswich](/events/chantry-2017-10-01-silver-sunday/)
* [Afternoon tea party at Framlingham Library](/events/framlingham-2017-10-01-silver-sunday/)
* [Tea party at Great Cornard Library](/events/great-cornard-2017-10-01-silver-sunday/)
* [Tea party at Newmarket Library](/events/newmarket-2017-10-01-silver-sunday/)

We would also like to remind customers of the [regular activities for older people across our libraries](/events-activities/older/).

We're also marking **Get Online Week** between 2 and 8 October, which aims to help people make the most of the internet. This year, the campaign is encouraging everyone to 'Try 1 Thing' by using the internet to do just one thing they would normally do, for example, in a shop or by phone. There will be [free internet taster sessions at Ipswich County Library on Tuesday 3 and Friday 6 October](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) and IT consultant Jeremy Bull will be providing [free 1-to-1 IT starter sessions at Chantry Library on Thursday 5 and Friday 6 October](/libraries/chantry-library/).

Many of our libraries provide [IT courses for beginners](/events-activities/get-online/) and help people use their devices and our [eLibrary](/elibrary/) services at Get Connected events throughout the year.

**National Libraries Week** runs from 9-15 October and we're starting the celebrations early with **Fun Palace** events on Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 October. Every October, community venues around the world hold Fun Palace events to enable everyone to explore their creative and scientific side while having lots of fun. Six libraries are creating Fun Palaces, and author Stella Duffy, the brain behind Fun Palaces, will even be making an appearance at Lowestoft Library:

* [Fun Palace at Chantry Library on Saturday 7 October](/events/chantry-2017-10-07-fun-palace/)
* [Fun Palace at Elmswell Library on Saturday 7 October](/events/elmswell-2017-10-07-fun-palace/)
* [Fun Palace at Gainsborough Community Library on Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 October](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/)
* [Fun Palace at Ipswich County Library on Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 October](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/)
