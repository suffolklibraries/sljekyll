On Saturday 19 November, Ipswich County Library are celebrating [International Games Day @ Your Library](http://igd.ala.org/). They will be launching a new Games Library service and holding free board and computer gaming programs and events suitable for all the family.

This will be the ninth International Games Day @ Your Library, and Ipswich will be joining thousands of other libraries around the world in inviting customers to try a new game, show off their gaming prowess, make new friends of all ages and, most importantly, have fun. Throughout the day, they are offering free access to the games from their new [Games Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/), which normally cost £1, £2, or £3 to borrow.

The day will feature:

- **Free tables for board game use on the ground floor all day.** Bring your own game or borrow one from the Games Library.
- **Children’s board games at the Children’s Library on the ground floor all day.** These will include giant snakes and ladders in the morning and giant chess in the afternoon.
- **Wii Dance in the refreshment area on the ground floor from 9:30am-12noon.**
- **[Ipswich Junior Chess Club](http://www.ipswichchess.co.uk) in the first floor lecture hall from 10am-12noon.** Any standard of budding chess player aged 6-16 welcome.
- **Board game demos and further free tables for board game use in the first floor lecture hall from 12noon-4:30pm.**
- **Junior Minecraft Club in the second floor Hub from 9:30am-11:30am**. Bring your own wifi device to share worlds with one another.
- **A raffle to win a Waterstones voucher** to buy a board game (or a book or two).

This is a free event but donations to increase our Games Library would be welcome.

International Games Day @ Your Library was set up in 2007 to reconnect communities through their libraries around the educational, recreational and social value of all types of games. Since then, an estimated 9,978 libraries and 260,000 participants in 53 counties have taken part in International Games Day @ Your Library events.
