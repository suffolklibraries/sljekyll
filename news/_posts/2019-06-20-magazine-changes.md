However, we will continue to offer a huge range of digital magazines free of charge via our [PressReader](/elibrary/pressreader/) service. PressReader offers much more choice, with over 8,000 digital magazine and newspaper titles available, including titles from around the world and covering a wide range of subjects.

Titles include <cite>Autocar</cite>, <cite>Amateur Photographer</cite>, <cite>Cosmopolitan</cite>, <cite>Country Homes and Interiors</cite>, <cite>Cycling Weekly</cite>, <cite>Elle</cite>, <cite>Empire</cite> and <cite>Esquire</cite>, as well as <cite>BBC Music</cite>, <cite>BBC History</cite>, <cite>BBC Top Gear</cite> and <cite>BBC Good Food</cite>. The service also offers free access to national daily newspapers.

We are also continuing to offer eBooks, eAudiobooks and digital music though [OverDrive](/elibrary/overdrive/), [BorrowBox](/elibrary/borrowbox/) and [Freegal](/elibrary/freegal).
