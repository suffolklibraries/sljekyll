Suffolk Libraries is giving the winner and runner up of a writing competition for students of University Campus Suffolk (UCS) an extra boost by converting their entries into library eBooks.

The Student New Angle Prize (SNAP) is aimed at UCS students and is run by the organisers of the New Angle Prize for Literature in conjunction with the English department of UCS. (SNAP) is an annual award for a piece of new writing (of 500 words) with an East Anglian connection: theme, topic, influence or association.

The 2016 winner was BA (Hons) English student Matt Annis for his piece entitled [<cite>The Bridge</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/A6F53760-E8DF-45E4-875E-8F79EA8B0F5F/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=C79784C2-5290-4FAC-B706-50A939C3E721). The runner-up was Janet Attfield, also a student of English at UCS, with [<cite>The Sailmaker</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/A6F53760-E8DF-45E4-875E-8F79EA8B0F5F/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=7521EABC-2AD3-43AE-A347-3273EF1AB87D).

Both pieces of writing have been converted into eBook format and are now available to download from the eLibrary catalogue at [www.suffolklibraries.co.uk](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk) which any member of Suffolk Libraries can access.

Hugh Pierce, General Manager of the Ipswich Institute, said: “The Ipswich Institute, organiser of the biennial New Angle Prize for Literature was delighted to recently welcome Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries on to its organising committee and we are looking forward to the involvement of Suffolk Libraries in promoting East Anglia’s major literary award. We were thrilled when Alison offered to help promote the SNAP by turning the top two entries into library eBooks.”

Suffolk Libraries recently launched the Suffolk Writes project as part of its Year of Reading campaign. Suffolk Writes gives aspiring writers the opportunity to showcase their work as a library eBook.
