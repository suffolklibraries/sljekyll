Chantry Library is one of the venues for the first ever festival of books and stories in South Ipswich later this month.

The library has teamed up with local schools, Ipswich Children's Book Group, Let's Talk Reading and Waterstone's to bring this celebration of children's books to Chantry from 13-19 November.

Authors James Campbell, Jane Elson, Steve Antony and Andy Briggs will be working in schools and taking part in Human Library and Book Jam events at the library.

The Human Library offers visitors a chance to borrow a 'human book' and find out about someone else's experiences by talking to them. The Book Jam features crafts, games and activities for children to celebrate books and incorporates a book wreath workshop for all ages from 10:30am-1pm.

Events confirmed so far are:

* Book Week at Hillside Primary School - 13-17 November
* Woodland Storytime at Dusk at The Oaks Primary School - Thursday 16 November, 3pm
* Book Jamboree Fair at The Oaks Primary School - Friday 17 November, 1:30-3pm
