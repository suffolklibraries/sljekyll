The trustees of Bungay Community Library are delighted to announce that Sir Laurie Magnus has agreed to become the library’s newest patrons.

Sir Laurie, who lives in Bungay, is Chairman of Historic England and a trustee of the English Heritage Trust. He has also had a long association with the National Trust and other not-for-profit organisations.

The library's other patrons are Luke Wright and <cite>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</cite> author Louis de Bernières, who both live locally.

Sylvia Knights, Secretary of Bungay Community Library, said: "We are delighted to welcome Sir Laurie Magnus as our newest patron. We are lucky to have so many well-known local people who recognise the value of our library service and wish to support us and I’d like to pay tribute to former patrons Elizabeth Jane Howard and Jim Prior who have sadly passed away in recent years."
