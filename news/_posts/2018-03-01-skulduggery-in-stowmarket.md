Stowmarket Library has launched Suffolk’s newest crime writers’ festival.

Skulduggery in Stowmarket will take place at the library over four days from 27 - 30 April. There will be talks from top crime writers including Elly Griffiths and Alison Bruce. There will also be a crime-themed quiz, a murder mystery, activity a self-publishing workshop and activities for younger readers.

Ursula Scott, Stowmarket Library Manager, said: “We’re really excited about Skulduggery in Stowmarket. The aim of the event is to bring some of the country’s best crime writers to the library, including local authors and those from further afield. The weekend will be a celebration of this hugely popular genre with a local twist and with a day of activities for younger readers, there will be something for everyone.”

The event will also build on the success of Slaughter in Southwold, the established crime writers' festival organised by Southwold Library every summer.

Tickets can be bought from [Stowmarket Library](/libraries/stowmarket-library/) and [Mid Suffolk Tourist Information Centre](https://www.visiteastofengland.com/Stowmarket-Mid-Suffolk-Tourist-Information-Centre/details/?dms=3&venue=0140657) from 6 March and will also be available online.
