Monday 20 January 2020 is known as Blue Monday - considered the most depressing day of the year. The holidays are over, the nights are long and dark, you’re back at work with no holidays in sight and your bank account is still recovering from all that Christmas spending.

Why not boost your mood by visiting a library? We've listed ten events and activities we hope will make you feel better.

## 1. Write down your worries

Throughout January, Newmarket Library are displaying a [worry tree](/events/newmarket-2020-01-02-jumpstart-worry-tree/), which you can add your worries to anonymously. Writing down your concerns has been repeatedly shown to have a positive impact on wellbeing and provide a much-needed therapeutic release, allowing you to focus on moving forward.

## 2. Enjoy the seaside

Do you miss the clement weather and seaside visits of the summer? Woodbridge Library are holding an [exhibition of amateur photographer Richard Mitchell's work](/events/woodbridge-2020-01-02-artlib-jan/) this month, which focusses on beaches, boats and the sea. Fulfil your longings for the seaside without getting cold or wet!

## 3. Connect through comics

Local artist and author Irina Richards has an exhibition, [Seeing Stories](/events/newmarket-2020-01-04-manga-exhibition/) at Newmarket Library until Sunday 26 January. Her work investigates life experiences, human relationships and connections with the world around us using the medium of comics and graphic novels, deals with sensitive issues and draws influences from diverse visual narrative traditions, including Japanese manga.

## 4. Take a break with chair-based relaxation

Ease the stresses of everyday life with a [chair-based relaxation session at Felixstowe Library](/events/felixstowe-2020-01-20-jumpstart-chair-relaxations/) from 2:30-3:30pm. Contact the library to book your place.

## 5. Learn to be mindful

Ipswich County Library will be running a [Mindfulness taster session with Wellbeing Suffolk](/events/ipswich-2020-01-20-jumpstart-mindfulness-workshop/) from 12-1pm which can boost your wellbeing and help you become more mindful of your surroundings.

There are six weekly sessions altogether, and you can pick which classes you want to go to for £5 each, or go to all six for £25.

## 8. Have fun with words

If you’re looking for a challenge or just enjoy socialising and playing games in good company, the new Chantry Scrabble group meets at [Chantry Library](/libraries/chantry-library/) from 2-4pm. The library also serves refreshments for a small charge and has a place where people who are happy to chat can offer company for others.

## 9. Improve your IT skills

Whether you want to make everyday tasks a little easier or connect with family and friends, drop in to [Kesgrave Library's](/libraries/kesgrave-library/) monthly IT drop-in session, where staff can help you get more from your device.

## 10. Grab a coffee at Open Space

[Open Space](/health/open-space/) is a weekly drop-in group run by Suffolk Libraries in partnership with Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, Julian Support, Richmond Fellowship and Suffolk Mind. There is no need to sign up and you can attend as often or as little as you like. On Blue Monday, the [Bury St Edmunds Library Open Space group](/health/open-space/bury/) will be going to Edmundo's for coffee and a chat - you can meet them at the library at 2pm.
