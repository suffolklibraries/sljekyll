Aldeburgh Library will be getting a makeover this autumn with an extensive refurbishment planned for September. The library is also soon welcoming a new manager with Caroline Boyd due to start later in July.

The refurbishment work is being funded by the Aldeburgh Library Foundation and will involve new carpet tiles, internal glazing panels in the foyer, new wheeled shelving, new wall shelving and IT areas. IT equipment used by customers will also be upgraded and enhanced with some additional equipment to benefit young people. To minimise the impact on customers, the work is being scheduled to coincide with additional work being carried out by Suffolk County Council to replace the library’s windows and doors.

Whilst the work is taking place, the library will have to close for two weeks from Thursday 1-18 September, reopening on Monday 19 September. The aim is to carry out the work when the current programme of adult education classes is finished and after the end of the Summer Reading Challenge.

The Aldeburgh Library Foundation has raised an impressive £30,000 over the past three years which is being used to fund the work. This has come from various sources including profits from the library’s popular adult education classes, our loyalty card scheme, sale of charity Christmas cards and grants from Aldeburgh Town Council, Suffolk County Council.

Lynne Walker, Chair of the Aldeburgh Library Foundation, said:

>We’re excited about these developments which should really modernise and improve the look of the library. I’m delighted that the activities of the Foundation, working together with Suffolk Libraries and with the support of many other people and organisations, will come to fruition in this project for the benefit of the community.

Suffolk Libraries and the Aldeburgh Library Foundation are grateful to the following for their generous fundraising contributions: Suffolk County Councillor Richard Smith, Suffolk Coastal District Councillors T-J Haworth-Culf and Maureen Jones, ATC, Waitrose Ltd, East of England Co-op, The Brittan-Pears Foundation and The Latymer Trust.

Suffolk Libraries apologises to any customers for the inconvenience during the closure and is advising local people of the interim arrangements.

Customers can use their library cards at any other Suffolk Library (the nearest are Leiston and Saxmundham). On Friday 2 September the mobile library also visits the nearby stops of Thorpeness, Aldringham, Knodishall, Friston, Snape, Sudbourne and Orford - [see all the stops here](/mobiles-home/saxmundham-mobile-library-route-8/).

People can also use the Suffolk Libraries website at [www.suffolklibraries.co.uk](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk) to renew books or reserve them and there is a free eBook and eMagazine download service. On Any library loans due back during the closure will have their return date automatically amended until after the library reopens.
