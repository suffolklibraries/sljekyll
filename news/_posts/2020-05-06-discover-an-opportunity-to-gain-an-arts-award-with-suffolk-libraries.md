Suffolk Libraries are sharing a new resource to inspire creativity amongst children and young people during lockdown.

The [Arts Award Discover logbook](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/assets/pdf/arts-award-discover-logbook.pdf) gives children and young people the chance to earn an Arts Award. This special logbook can be downloaded and printed at home and used to record experiences of taking part in reading, being creative and researching an author or illustrator.

Arts Award Discover is an introductory award open to children and young people aged from 5 to 25. Once the logbook is completed, they will receive a certificate of achievement.

Physical copies of the Discover Arts Award Logbook are also being delivered to families in Ipswich as part of a [‘creative pack’](https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/project/ipswich-respect/) coordinated via Volunteering Matters who are supporting families by delivering activity packs to over 100 families across Ipswich, prioritizing those who have limited access to technology and internet.

Several local organisations have worked together to contribute resources and materials to these packs through the We are Ipswich partnership which includes Suffolk Libraries, Ipswich Museums, DanceEast, Eastern Angles, Gecko, New Wolsey Theatre, Pacitti Company (SPILL Festival) & Red Rose Chain.

Whilst many activities are currently available digitally, the aim of the activity packs is to support families who do not have access to a computer or the internet and to continue to encourage creativity at home for Suffolk’s young people.

Tonia Wilson, Project Manager at Volunteering Matters said:

“RESPECT (Respect, education, support and praise equals a community that trusts) from Volunteering Matters Ipswich is a project to respond to COVID-19 to help the community to volunteer safely and stay connected. One aspect of the project is to create children and adult packs to deliver to the wider community, which have been added to by volunteers and partners. These packs are fun, informative and user-friendly to allow them to reach all areas of the community. The family pack is bilingual to support parents with English as an additional language.”

Sally Garwood, Creative Programmes Coordinator at Suffolk Libraries added:

“Coronavirus has changed a lot for families in the past few weeks and we understand parents and carers might be worried about balancing working from home with family life, from creating structure to coping with difficult feelings. We want to support families by inspiring creative learning at home through easy resources, and Arts Award is designed to be accessible to children and young people with a range of abilities, backgrounds and individual learning requirements. Suffolk Libraries are committed to supporting free learning and creative opportunities for children and young people - especially during this uncertain time.”

Suffolk Libraries' Arts Programme has also created a series of [workshops and podcasts](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/online-and-streamed-events/recordings/) during lockdown and Suffolk Libraries is hosting a new [directory of online arts experiences](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/online-and-streamed-events/arts-activities/).

**Note to parents:**

You may wish to print the logbook in black and white to save ink. Once your child has completed their logbook please email arts@suffolklibraries.co.uk to notify us with your name and contact number. You will need to keep hold of your child’s logbook for the time being. Once it is safe enough for libraries to reopen to the public, you will be able to drop off or send the completed logbook to your local library once it is safe to do so. 

When you drop off or send the logbook, please make sure your name and contact details are included so we can arrange to send your child their certificate.
