From Monday 16 February Felixstowe Library will be open 7 days a week.

The new hours are being partly funded by new partnership working arrangements with Suffolk Coastal District Council, which will see Felixstowe Library effectively become a ‘one stop shop’, providing the council’s customer services and information, as well as library services, under one roof.

Following consultation with customers, the library will open on Mondays from 10am to 4pm from 16 February and from the first week of March late opening on Fridays will reduce, closing at 5.30pm instead of 7.30pm. The library will carry on opening until 7.30pm on Fridays until March &#8211; meaning in future the library will be open a total of 4 extra hours a week.

Prior to the move, a new meeting room has been created and new desks for the Suffolk Coastal and library staff have been installed. The library has also recently refurbished its children’s library area as a result of fundraising efforts, ready for the library’s new launch.

Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries Board, said: &#8220;We welcome this new partnership facility at Felixstowe Library. A similar arrangement in Beccles Library was launched a year ago and has been working very well with increased visits to the library and positive feedback from both library and council customers. I’m sure local people will appreciate being able to access an even wider range of key services in one place.&#8221;
