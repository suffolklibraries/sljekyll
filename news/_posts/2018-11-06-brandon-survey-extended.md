Brandon residents now have until the end of November to give their views on the library's proposed new opening hours.

The library is proposing staying open an for additional hour on Wednesdays and closing one hour earlier on Fridays, so the total number of opening hours would remain the same. We are aiming for opening times that are better aligned with other services at the Brandon Centre, where the library is based, as well as more convenient for customers.

The proposed new hours at Brandon Library are:

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Wednesday - 10am - 3pm (currently 10am - 2pm)
* Thursday - 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 6pm (currently 10am - 7pm)
* Saturday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Sunday - 10am - 3pm (no change)

Customers can fill in the [Brandon Library opening hours survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Brandonlibhours) online or in the library. The deadline for completing the survey is now **Friday 30 November** and any change in hours will then have to be agreed by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.
