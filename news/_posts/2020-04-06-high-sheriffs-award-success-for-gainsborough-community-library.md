Gainsborough Community Library in Ipswich is celebrating after winning the Strengthen Your Community Award at the [Suffolk High Sheriff’s Awards](https://www.suffolkcf.org.uk/meet-the-2020-high-sheriffs-award-winners/) recently.

Gainsborough Community Library plays a pivotal role in its community. Although the library is closed at the moment due to the coronavirus situation it runs around 30 different types of events and activities. These include activities for children, young people and older people, as well as health and wellbeing, arts and crafts and even sports and martial arts sessions. It also has a popular volunteer-run café.

Mandy Grimwood, Manager of Gainsborough Library, said:

“We are incredibly honoured to have received the Strengthen Your Community Award at The High Sheriff's Awards; we are so passionate about the community we are in and providing the best we can to those around us. It’s not just our incredible staff and volunteers but every face that we see, that smiles with us, that uses the library or any one of our activities or services that makes Gainsborough Community Library what it is. We hope you are all safe and well, we hope to see you all soon!”

Rachel Wood of Newmarket Library Friends Group was also shortlisted for the Volunteer of the Year award.
