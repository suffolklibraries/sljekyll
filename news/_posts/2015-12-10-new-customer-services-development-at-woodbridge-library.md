Suffolk Coastal and Suffolk Libraries are sharing plans for the new customer service facility at Woodbridge Library.

In September, Suffolk Coastal agreed to expand and improve its Customer Service provision at the library. This investment supports Suffolk Coastal’s planned move from its current offices to smaller accommodation in Melton during autumn 2016.

The improved Customer Service Centre within Woodbridge Library will be the face to face point of customer contact for Suffolk Coastal, with more staff being based at the library and able to deal with more enquiries. Customers will also benefit from services that the library provides including printing services, internet access and free WiFi.

The development will incorporate a new shared helpdesk for library and council staff, a new private interview room and a quieter dedicated area for accessing computers and for reading or study. These changes will enhance the overall customer experience for all customers.

Alison Wheeler, Suffolk Library’s General Manager, added:

> We are pleased to be enhancing our partnership working with Suffolk Coastal over this exciting project, which builds upon the presence they have had at Woodbridge Library for several years.
>
> Working together in this way provides additional income to support the running of the library, which is a vital community resource, servicing everyone including tourists, families, students, reading groups and so many more!

The improvements are planned to be carried out between mid-February and the end of March, organised by Suffolk Coastal’s in-house Property Services Department. The library and Suffolk Coastal Customer Services will remain open during this time, and will ensure that any disruption to customers is kept to a minimum.

Further details of the work schedule will be issued, ahead of the project starting, early next year in 2016.
