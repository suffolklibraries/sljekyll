From 1 - 15 August, you can borrow <cite>The Binding</cite> by Bridget Collins on OverDrive without a wait list and join in a UK-wide discussion.

> "Emmett Farmer is working in the fields when a letter arrives summoning him to begin an apprenticeship. He will work for a Bookbinder, a vocation that arouses fear, superstition and prejudice – but one neither he nor his parents can afford to refuse.

> "He will learn to hand-craft beautiful volumes, and within each he will capture something unique and extraordinary: a memory. If there’s something you want to forget, he can help. If there’s something you need to erase, he can assist. Your past will be stored safely in a book and you will never remember your secret, however terrible.

> "In a vault under his mentor’s workshop, row upon row of books – and memories – are meticulously stored and recorded.

> "Then one day Emmett makes an astonishing discovery: one of them has his name on it."
