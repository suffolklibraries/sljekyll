A conference to help businesses in the region tackle the issue of poor mental health in the workplace is taking place in Ipswich on Monday 30 March.

The [Proactive Workplace Mental Health Summit](https://hivesuffolk.co.uk/) is taking place at on the University of Suffolk's Waterfront Building.

The conference aims to help companies understand the costs of poor mental health and stress in the workplace. It will also help to show the positive action they can take to address the issue to benefit their employees and their bottom line. The event is being organised by Suffolk Libraries’ new HIVE network in partnership with Suffolk Mind.

A 2017 government-commissioned report by Deloitte estimated that poor mental health in the workplace costs employers between £33bn and £42bn every year. Although workplace absence has fallen in recent years, the proportion of days lost due to mental health issues has risen.

However, the research also found that the return on investment of workplace mental health interventions can make a big difference when it comes to tackling the issue.

HIVE has also engaged key business leaders to support the development of the conference, with the following acting as advisors to the programme:

* David Sheepshanks CBE, Business and Life Coach for Vistage Group and former Chairman of Ipswich Football Club
* Doug Field, CEO of East of England Co-op and Chair of the LEP
* Jon Neal, CEO of Suffolk Mind.

Jon Neal said: "Wellbeing and health in the workplace has never been so important, or had such a high profile as it does right now. It’s not just about social responsibility and being a considerate employer because it’s nice to be one – there is more and more evidence of its impact on the bottom line as well.

"Mental wellbeing in the workplace makes a big difference, not just to sickness and absence rates, but also to motivation and performance. The most successful employers are those that create environments in which their teams can meet their physical and emotional needs in healthy ways.”

The all-day conference will feature speakers and discussions exploring the legal framework around the Equality Act, Disability Discrimination Act and Mental Health Act review. It will also show delegates how to put a mental health and wellbeing framework in place.

Speakers on the day will represent the experiences of top companies including UBS, Direct Line Group, Astra Zeneca, ACAS, Adnams, C&I Wellbeing, RWE, Aon, Havas Creative Group and City of London Corporation.

There is an early bird 33% discounted rate of £199 for bookings made before Friday 7 February. There are also opportunities on the day for sponsors and exhibitors. Anyone interested should contact Nikki Hulse at Suffolk Libraries at **nikki.hulse@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
