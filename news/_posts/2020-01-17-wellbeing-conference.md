A conference to help businesses in the region tackle the issue of poor mental health in the workplace is taking place in Ipswich on Monday 30 March.

The [Proactive Workplace Mental Health Summit](https://hivesuffolk.co.uk/) is taking place at on the University of Suffolk's Waterfront Building.

The conference aims to help companies understand the costs of poor mental health and stress in the workplace. It will also help to show the positive action they can take to address the issue to benefit their employees and their bottom line. The event is being organised by Suffolk Libraries’ new HIVE network.

The recent [Mental Health and Employers: Refreshing the Case for Investment report from Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consulting/articles/mental-health-and-employers-refreshing-the-case-for-investment.html) estimated that poor mental health at work costs UK employers up to £45 billion a year. Although workplace absence has fallen in recent years, the proportion of days lost due to mental health issues has risen.

However, the research also found that the return on investment of workplace mental health interventions can make a big difference when it comes to tackling the issue.

HIVE has also engaged key business leaders to support the development of the conference, with the following acting as advisors to the programme:

* David Sheepshanks CBE, Business and Life Coach for Vistage Group and former Chairman of Ipswich Football Club
* Doug Field, Chair of New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership and Joint CEO of the East of England Co-Op

Doug Field, said:

“I’ve learned the hard way about the importance of looking after your own and others’ emotional wellbeing. The agenda, speakers and discussions at the Suffolk Hive event look like they can help and make a real positive difference to how you lead your organisation. I’d definitely recommend attending this day on 30 March to get some top tips for managing and improving mental health in your organisation.”

The all-day conference will feature speakers and discussions exploring the legal framework around the Equality Act, Disability Discrimination Act and Mental Health Act review. It will also show delegates how to put a mental health and wellbeing framework in place.

Speakers on the day will represent the experiences of top companies including UBS, Direct Line Group, Astra Zeneca, ACAS, Adnams, RWE, Aon, Havas Creative Group and City of London Corporation.

There are also opportunities on the day for sponsors and exhibitors. Anyone interested should contact Nikki Hulse at Suffolk Libraries at **nikki.hulse@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
