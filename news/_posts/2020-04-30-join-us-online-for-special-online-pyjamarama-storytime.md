Many of our libraries will be sharing a fun-filled festival of online storytelling for children and families on Friday (1 May) as part of Booktrust’s Pyjamarama event.

[Pyjamarama](http://www.booktrust.org.uk/pyjamarama) is an annual event run by the charity Booktrust to celebrate the bedtime story. This year the event is being run online and Booktrust have kindly sent copies of the children’s book ‘My Pet Star’ by Corrinne Averiss to several Suffolk Libraries staff to read to their online audience via Facebook.

Many staff will be reading the book in their pyjamas throughout the day. The storytelling events will be shared via the libraries’ Facebook pages along with other star-themed activities. Additional copies of the book will be sent to libraries to give away to parents once they reopen. 

James Powell, Marketing and Communications Manager at Suffolk Libraries, said:

“Like many events at the moment, this year’s Pyjamarama is taking place online. Many of our library staff were very quick in volunteering to get involved and read the story online. Our staff have already embraced this new way of working, sharing hundreds of online activities, including storytelling, crafts, puppet shows and many other activities which have been enjoyed many thousands of times across the county. We hope many families will join in with Friday’s Pyjamarama event and enjoy hearing the story together at home.”

Many of the My Pet Star readings will take place during the [regular storytime sessions for children](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/online-and-streamed-events/live/) which are now being run online.

The full list of libraries sharing a reading of the book is as follows. These will all be shared on the library Facebook pages on Friday 1 May.  Many library staff will be wearing their pyjamas when reading the book and anyone watching is encouraged to do the same!
