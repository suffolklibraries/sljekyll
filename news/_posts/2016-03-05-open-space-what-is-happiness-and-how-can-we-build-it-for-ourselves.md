(Answers in bold were the most common answers)

What is happiness?

  * A feeling, atmosphere, people/ places
  * Something that&#8217;s evasive
  * Gives you a nice feeling inside
  * Music
  * Bodybuilding
  * Exercise
  * A positive feeling/ sensation which makes you feel good
  * **Friends**
  * A feeling
  * **Animals**
  * **It&#8217;s a feeling but I think it is a succession of feelings. You start with feeling well, then wellbeing, then making your own happiness, then happy &#8211; Yippee!**
  * Happy &#8211; feeling good in the moment
  * Play on my laptop
  * **Feeling at peace**
