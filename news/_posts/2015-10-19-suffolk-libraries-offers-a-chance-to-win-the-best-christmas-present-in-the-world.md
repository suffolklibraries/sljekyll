Suffolk Libraries is running a fantastic festive children’s competition and has two family tickets up for grabs for a special concert on 18 November hosted by Waterstones Bookshops at St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds. The concert will feature War Horse author Michael Morpurgo reading from his short story <cite>The Best Christmas Present in the World</cite>.

To win one of these family tickets Suffolk Libraries is asking children to write a letter to Michael Morpurgo explaining what their ‘Best Christmas Present in the World’ would be.

The winners will also receive a signed copy of <cite>The Best Christmas Present in the World</cite> and will get a chance to meet Michael Morpurgo to give him their letters after the performance.

The former Children’s Laureate will be accompanied by the renowned stage and screen actress Virginia McKenna and the six-piece acapella group Voices at the Door who will be singing Christmas carols from Britain, France and Flanders.

The competition is open for any Suffolk children aged under 16. Entries should be less than 200 words and should be emailed to competition@suffolklibraries.co.uk or handed in to any branch of Suffolk Libraries (with contact details attached). The competition closes on Thursday 5 November at 5pm. The winners will be selected and notified on Friday 6 November 2015. The two winning entries will each receive a family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) for the event at St Edmundsbury Cathedral at 7pm on 18th November.

<cite>The Best Christmas Present in the World</cite> is a moving short-story of a young soldier named Jim and his personal account of the famous World War One Christmas Truce of 1914 in which an unforgettable football match took place in No-Man’s Land between the British and German troops. A century on from this landmark event, a soldier’s letter is found by chance in an antique desk &#8211; “Jim’s Last Letter: to be buried with me when the time comes.” And thus begins the quest to find his “Dearest Connie”.

Tickets for the event are £15 for adults, £8 for children and £40 for a family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) and are available from Waterstones Bury St Edmunds Butter Market (01284 750877) or Waterstones Bury St Edmunds Arc Centre (01284 750726) and [www.waterstones.com/events](http://www.waterstones.com/events).
