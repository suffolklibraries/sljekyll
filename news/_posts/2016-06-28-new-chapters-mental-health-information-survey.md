It’s been a busy year so far for Suffolk Libraries’ Mental health and wellbeing information service. We’ve had radio interviews, adverts, articles, bus tours, new leaflets and not to mention the makeover and new name!

The Open Space group in Ipswich is going from strength to strength and are planning a few trips out over the summer, some of the group have also formed a Time To Change campaign group and we’re almost ready to pilot Open Space in Bury and Haverhill.

Our libraries have created wonderful book displays themed around mental health and wellbeing, including some great creative displays for Mental Health Awareness Week and together we helped to launch the new Books on Prescription list for Young People.

We’ve teamed up with Suffolk Refugee Support to help set up a network for women who have survived FGM, some of our libraries are working with their local Dementia Action Alliance groups to contribute to dementia friendly communities and we’ve got some fantastic new projects on the horizon, including a film club and some employability programmes. I was also lucky enough to spend the day at the Wellcome Trust and hear of all the exciting things happening around libraries and health. We’re in a really lucky position here in Suffolk, in having resources dedicated to mental health and wellbeing information (As far as we know, we’re the only county).  We want to ensure we’re reaching as many people as possible and that up to date, reliable information is easy to access.  

With this in mind, we would like to hear people’s ideas and views on the service, to help us see what works for you and discover any areas in which we can improve. So we have set up an online survey at [www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SLNewchapters](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SLNewchapters). You don’t have to be a customer of the library to complete it as our information is available to everyone. If you have any questions please get in touch at **mentalhealth@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.
