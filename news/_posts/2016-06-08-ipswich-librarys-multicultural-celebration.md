Ipswich County Library’s annual Multicultural Day returns on Saturday 25 June with a day of performances and activities celebrating the diverse Ipswich community.

The popular annual event is completely free and runs from 10.30am to 3.30pm.

The events and activities this year include: a middle eastern live band, flamenco performance and workshop, African drummers, cuban samba, ATS tribal bellydance, African and Indian food, Henna tattoos, face painting, a fashion show, African stories and a live kids’ radio station.

Anyone is welcome to drop in to the library throughout the day and there will be other stalls provided by local multicultural organisations. The event will close with a set by nationally acclaimed folk band Kiss the Mistress.

The event has developed into a very popular celebration and a great way of bring people from different communities in Ipswich together.

Helen Milne at Ipswich Library who takes a key role in coordinating the event, said:

>Ipswich County Library is very proud to be running this popular event, now in its eighth year. It is more important than ever to celebrate the diversity and creativity in our town and what better way to celebrate than with a free day packed full of performances, activities, food and information. This year we really do have the best line-up ever, with lots to enjoy.

The event will also include a print-making workshop by Oyster Community Press as part of a project they are running at the library called ‘Eye for Ipswich’ which will feature a special exhibition on display at the library from 23 June for a month. Members of the library’s Chat n’ Chill group which runs twice a week for women who do not speak English as their first language have been involved in this project.

Oyster Press will be demonstrating printmaking techniques at the Multicultural Day from 11am to 12noon and from 1pm to 3pm there will be a chance for people to create their own piece of art using traditional printmaking equipment. Places on this workshop are limited and must be booked in advance.

Staff from Ipswich Library work with various local groups including people from India, Africa, Zimbabwe, Poland, Afghanistan, Romania, Lithuania, Russia and China. Ipswich Library has also worked with the Anglo Chinese Cultural Exchange to deliver Mandarin classes at the library and helps many people with their British Citizenship information.
