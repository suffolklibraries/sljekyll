Ipswich County Library’s annual Multicultural Day returns on Saturday 27 June and is bigger than ever this year!

This year’s event features bagpipes, Bollywood dance, panpipes, Chinese children&#8217;s dragon dance workshop, polish songs, recorder music and tribal belly dance. There will also be children’s craft activities, world food and craft stalls, a pop-up café’, a fashion show and information stands from multicultural community groups from across Ipswich.

The event runs from 10.30am to 3.30pm and anyone is welcome to drop in to the library throughout the day. The event has been running for the past few years and has developed into a very popular celebration and a great way of bring people from different communities in Ipswich together.

Helen Milne at Ipswich County Library who takes a key role in coordinating the event, said: “Our Multicultural Day celebrates the diverse local community and is a free and fun-filled event bringing the people of Ipswich together. There are usually over a thousand visitors to the library throughout the day and I hope more people will drop in this year to enjoy the activities and there will be plenty of opportunities to join in.”

This will be the first year that members of the library’s Chat n’ Chill group have performed. The Chat n’ Chill sessions run twice a week for women who do not speak English as their first language.

Staff from Ipswich County Library work with various local groups including people from India, Africa, Zimbabwe, Poland, Afghanistan, Romania, Lithuania, Russia and China. Ipswich County Library has also worked with the Anglo Chinese Cultural Exchange to deliver Mandarin classes at the library and helps many people with their British Citizenship information.

Note to editors: There are plenty of photo opportunities throughout the day and an agenda of the timings of each performance will be available nearer the time if that would be useful. We have plenty of photos from previous events if they would be useful.
