Three libraries in east Suffolk are raising funds by challenging people to walk or cycle between their sites.

[Aldeburgh](/libraries/aldeburgh-library/), [Leiston](/libraries/leiston-library/) and [Saxmundham](/libraries/saxmundham-library/) libraries are offering the opportunity for customers to register at their starting library, collect a map and 'challenge passport' and walk or cycle to one or both other libraries, where their passport will be stamped as a record of their journey. It costs £5 to register for the challenge, and you can do it over more than one day if you wish.

This challenge has been organised in support of [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) (Saturday 12 October), a fundraising campaign for Suffolk Libraries supported by Hughes Electrical, Adnams, Ipswich Buses, the University of Suffolk and many other partners. The three libraries will be keeping track of their participants' miles, with the winning library to be announced on the big day.

Nikki Hulse, business development manager at Suffolk Libraries, said:

"Suffolk Libraries Day is a fantastic opportunity for libraries to be creative and think of new and exciting activities and challenges that encourage people to see what libraries have to offer and have fun doing it.

"The Three Library Challenge allows people to get to know their libraries and what they provide for their communities – and keep fit at the same time!"
