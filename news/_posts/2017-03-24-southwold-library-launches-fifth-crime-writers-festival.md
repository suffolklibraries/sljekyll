[Southwold Library](/libraries/southwold-library) has launched its fifth annual [Slaughter in Southwold festival](/slaughter). The established crime writers' festival will feature a number of top crime writers giving talks about their writing at on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 June.

This year the event is moving to a bigger venue - Southwold Arts Centre - and will be part of [Southwold Arts Festival](http://www.southwoldartsfestival.co.uk/). Slaughter in Southwold is organised by Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark with support from the [Friends of Southwold Library](/about/member-organisations/friends-of-southwold-library-fosl/) and the [Crime Writers' Association](http://www.thecwa.co.uk/).

This year’s packed programme features Elly Griffiths, M.J. Arlidge, Isabelle Grey, Harry Brett, Guy Fraser-Sampson, John Nightingale, Paul Harrison and Ruth Dugdall.

Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark said: "It's amazing to be celebrating the fifth birthday of Slaughter in Southwold. We never envisaged in 2013 when we started with one day in the Scout Hut that in 2017 we would have a whole weekend revelling in meeting established and up and coming crime writers. It's great to welcome back Ruth Dugdall, who first came in 2013 and Elly Griffiths, who came to our second festival. This year Slaughter in Southwold has moved to a bigger venue, Southwold Arts Centre, so even more people can come and enjoy the weekend."
