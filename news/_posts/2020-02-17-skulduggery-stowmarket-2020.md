Stowmarket Library has announced the programme for the 2020 [Skulduggery in Stowmarket](/skulduggery/) crime writers' festival, taking place from 24-26 April.

2020 marks the festival's third year, following its successful launch in 2018 and well-received return in 2019. This year's line-up includes Laura Purcell, Harry Brett, Rebecca Tope and Simon Brett.

Stowmarket Library Manager Ursula Scott said: "Last year’s festival was hugely successful with more than 250 people attending the various events, and this year’s festival promises to be even bigger and better.

"We received great feedback from the event last year, including 'brilliant – wish I had done both days', 'lovely atmosphere', 'exceptionally well run', and 'sparkling!'"

The weekend starts on Friday 24 April with a live music event from local band Skiffuffle, playing a mixture of skiffle, Americana, novelty and other songs from the 1920s-70s. There will be a licensed bar and the ticket price includes a pizza supper.

On Saturday 25 April and Sunday 26 April, the library will play host to five authors on each day, giving talks and Q&A sessions about their books and styles of writing. The authors on Saturday are Rebecca Tope, Harry Brett, Louise Millar, Jim Kelly and Rory Clements. Sunday’s authors are Michael Jecks, JM Hewitt, Ruth Dugdall, Laura Purcell and Simon Brett.

Single-session, all-day and all-weekend tickets are available to purchase online or by contacting the library.
