Several Suffolk Libraries will be celebrating the magic of bedtime stories for BookTrust's [Pyjamarama](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/pyjamarama/) campaign next week (3 - 9 June).

Libraries across the county are inviting parents and children to come to special [Bookstart sessions](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) and one-off events dressed in their pyjamas and enjoy stories, rhymes, crafts and more. We've also picked out some of our [favourite bedtime stories](/parents-carers-and-children/pyjamarama-bedtime-stories/) to mark the occasion and inspire parents to pick up a book at bedtime.

Last week, BookTrust reported that [54% of parents are swapping bedtime stories for tech](https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/bedtime-stories-suffolk-libraries-1-6071965). The Pyjamarama initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of bedtime stories in children's learning and development, and help as many families as possible enjoy them.

Suffolk Libraries head of service delivery Krystal Vittles said: "Books at bedtime help develop good bedtime habits. Getting small children into healthy bedtime habits is hard at the best of times and books can be a good tool to bring the child down to a place of calm and comfort, which are the perfect conditions for sleep. This ultimately has a positive impact on the adult as the child will be ready to sleep.

"We know that reading is the biggest influence when it comes to positive life outcomes, so reading at night builds good habits that can last a lifetime for a child."

BookTrust states: "There’s nothing quite like a bedtime story. It’s a magical, joyful time for little ones and their families. There’s nothing quite like a bedtime story. It’s a magical, joyful time for little ones and their families."

A full list of Pyjamarama events across our libraries follows. If [your local library](/libraries/) does not appear here, please contact them as they may still be celebrating Pyjamarama as part of their Bookstart sessions.
