Several Suffolk Libraries will be celebrating the magic of bedtime stories for BookTrust's [Pyjamarama](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/pyjamarama/) campaign next week (3 - 9 June).

Libraries across the county are inviting parents and children to come to special [Bookstart sessions](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) and one-off events dressed in their pyjamas and enjoy stories, rhymes, crafts and more. The initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of bedtime stories and help as many children as possible enjoy them.

A full list of Pyjamarama events across our libraries follows. If [your local library](/libraries/) does not appear here, please contact them as they may still be celebrating Pyjamarama as part of their Bookstart sessions.
