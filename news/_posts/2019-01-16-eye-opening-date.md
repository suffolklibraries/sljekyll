The new [Eye Library](/libraries/eye-library/) is due to open its doors for the first time next week - at 2pm on Thursday 24 January.

The new library in Cross Street was designed and overseen by Concertus Design & Property Consultants Ltd and constructed by building firm RG Carter during 2018, and handed over to Suffolk Libraries just before Christmas. The current library closed for the last time last Sunday (13 January) and staff are currently moving and setting up everything at the new library so that it is ready for opening.

Tony Brown, chair of Suffolk Libraries said: "It’s hugely positive to be able to open a new library. It’s been a great team effort with Suffolk County Council, Concertus and RG Carter working together with Suffolk Libraries to deliver a modern facility that will provide a better library environment and experience for everyone in the local community."

Julie Shepherd, manager of Eye Library, said "Everyone’s very excited about our new library including staff and our regular customers. Hopefully everyone will come along and take a look at the new library and what we have to offer, particularly anyone who may not have visited the library for a while. Everyone is always welcome!"

Councillor Paul West, Suffolk County Council’s Cabinet Member for Communities, said: "It’s fantastic to see the plans to open the new library in Eye coming to fruition. With the new facility up and running by the end of the month, I’m sure many customers will flock to the library to see everything that is on offer. It’s a great investment for Eye, one that I’m certain will be welcomed by residents and visitors alike."

Katherine Williams, architectural designer at Concertus Design & Property Consultants Ltd, said: "We are delighted to have been part of this rare opportunity, collaborating with Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Libraries, to provide a brand-new library facility for Eye.

"The use of colour showcases a modern, vibrant facility to form a focal point for Eye, rejuvenating Cross Street by making use of a site occupied by an unattractive, dilapidated office building. The vaulted ceiling in the internal library area, creates a light and inviting space which offers itself to becoming flexible as a resource centre to the benefit of Eye and the wider community.”

The new library will have wheeled shelving which can be moved aside to create more space for events and activities. It will also offer accessible toilet facilities and an interactive information screen and a hireable meeting room. Like all of our libraries, it will offer a range of books, DVDs and other items, activities for children and families, free wifi and internet access, printing facilities and information about the local area.

The plans for the project were agreed by Suffolk County Council in March 2018, with the new building being funded by the sale of the current site where the library has been for around 40 years. The old building was never designed to be permanent and the new library will provide a modern and purpose-built facility for the residents of Eye and surrounding areas to enjoy.

We apologise to customers for any inconvenience during the temporary closure. The move has been planned to minimise the impact on customers as much as possible and people should see the benefits when the new library opens.

While the library is closed, you can use any other Suffolk library, the nearest being [Stradbroke](/libraries/stradbroke-library/) and [Debenham](/libraries/debenham-library/). Any library loans due back during the closure will have their return date automatically amended until after the new library opens. You can also [renew and reserve items online](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/).
