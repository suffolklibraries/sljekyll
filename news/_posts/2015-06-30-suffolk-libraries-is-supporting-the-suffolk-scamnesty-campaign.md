Every year, more than three million people in the UK fall victim to scams, losing hundreds and sometimes thousands of pounds to fraudsters. To raise awareness of this increasing problem, Suffolk Trading Standards, in partnership with BBC Radio Suffolk’s Mark Murphy Show, has launched Scamnesty; a month long initiative that encourages people to report potential scams and help prevent others from falling victim.

Throughout July, Scamnesty bins will be available across the county for people to discard any suspicious letters/leaflets/mail they suspect may be fraudulent. Everything placed into the bins will be analysed and the information shared with Trading Standards and partner enforcement agencies in the UK.

Suffolk Libraries are supporting the campaign with scamnesty bins in our libraries and we’ll also be promoting it via our home library service and mobile libraries.

Don’t forget you can report any potential scams by calling Suffolk Trading Standards on 0345 404 0506.
