As the Summer Reading Challenge draws to a close, local libraries are gearing up for their award presentations. Thousands of children who completed this year's space-themed challenge will be presented with a medal and certificate for their efforts, with many of the ceremonies having local dignitaries and authors in attendance.

Two weeks ago, we released the early statistic that [more children signed up to the Summer Reading Challenge in 2019 than last year](/news/latest-src-figures/).

Suffolk Libraries head of digital and marketing Leon Paternoster said: "We’re thrilled that just under 8,000 children took part in this year’s challenge, an 8% increase on last summer. We helped increase literacy levels in preparation for the new school year, gave parents a chance to spend some quality time with their children and had lots of fun along the way."

All children who have signed up for the Summer Reading Challenge and read the six books as required will be rewarded for their efforts at one of the local library presentations below. Contact [your local library](/libraries/) if their ceremony is not listed.
