Clare Library will be closed for refurbishment from 10 - 17 June, reopening on Tuesday 18 June.

Among other improvements, the library will be enhancing its current children’s facilities and adding to its existing storage facilities.

The refurbishment has been paid for by developer contribution funds and fundraising from the Friends of Clare Library.

Library manager Karla Greenwood said: "We are refurbishing Clare Library to create an enhanced children’s area, at the same time creating a more flexible space, with more storage.

"It will enable us to provide a more user-friendly environment which will also be better for our Ciné Clair evenings, from which funds raised have gone towards this work."

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this temporary closure. Any library loans due back during the closure will be automatically extended and local residents are welcome to use any other library during the closure, the nearest being [Kedington](/libraries/kedington-library/) and [Glemsford](/libraries/glemsfordlibrary/).
