Suffolk Libraries is asking customers for their views on its online research, study and leisure resources.

People can access various online resources from libraries or via the [Suffolk Libraries website](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/) including a [version of Ancestry](http://www.ancestrylibrary.com/) so they can look into their family history and [Access to Research](http://www.accesstoresearch.org.uk/) which provides access to millions of academic research papers and journals.

Suffolk Libraries is asking customers to complete an online survey to help organise these resources so they’re easier to find and access in the future. The survey shouldn't take longer than 10 to 15 minutes to complete. [Take the survey](https://suffolklibraries.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/g32ukdz1).

The survey closes on Friday 18 November. Everyone who completes the exercise will be entered into a free prize draw to win a £50 love2shop voucher.
