Suffolk Libraries is increasing opening hours at Kesgrave by six and a half hours a week to meet local demand.

Following a consultation with customers, as of Monday 2 July, the library will be open for two additional sessions a week - Monday mornings from 9am to 12pm and Friday afternoons from 2.30pm to 6pm. This means the library will be open every day of the week.

Kesgrave Library is a small but increasingly popular library and Suffolk Libraries Board recently agreed that the hours should increase to reflect demand from local people.

The recent consultation was completed by over 260 people who were asked to give their preference for which extra sessions would be most helpful to them.

The new opening hours will be:

* Monday - 9am - 12pm (currently closed)
* Tuesday - 9am - 12pm and 2:30pm - 5pm (no change)
* Wednesday - 2:30pm - 6pm (no change)
* Thursday - 2:30pm - 8pm (no change)
* Friday - 9am - 12pm and 2:30pm - 6pm (currently 9am - 12pm)
* Saturday - 10am - 5pm (no change)
* Sunday - 10am - 3pm (no change)

Bruce Leeke, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: “Opening hours in our libraries had not changed for many years and Suffolk Libraries has been happy to work with staff and community groups to support changes in several libraries to reflect local demand.

“Most have kept the same hours but there was a strong case for increasing the hours at Kesgrave to improve our service for local people. In challenging times when libraries in other places are being closed or are having hours cut, the Suffolk Libraries model continues to be a success, with our opening hours being sustained or, in this case, even increasing.”
