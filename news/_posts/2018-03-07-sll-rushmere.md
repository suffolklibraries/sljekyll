A new Suffolk Libraries Local session in Rushmere launched at Ransomes Sports Pavilion on 14 March.

Also known as 'Library @ the Pavilion', [Rushmere (Suffolk Libraries Local)](/libraries/rushmere/) will run every Wednesday from 1:30pm - 4:30pm at the Sidegate Avenue venue.

The sessions are part of the [Suffolk Libraries Local scheme](/local/) and have been funded by a £10,460 grant by the Borough’s North East Area Committee, with additional support from Suffolk County Councillor Sandra Gage through her locality funding.

Each week, residents will be able to borrow from a selection of books and can reserve books from the main Suffolk Libraries catalogue and use IT facilities.

There will also be a range of activities, including ‘singing and stories’ for pre-school children, a social group for older people and a homework club.

Bruce Leeke, chief executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Ipswich Borough Council to deliver a new library service to this part of Ipswich. The new Suffolk Libraries Local session will aim to deliver a regular slice of library life to people in the Rushmere area with not just books but free computer access and regular children’s activities. We’re also very pleased to be able to extend the existing Suffolk Libraries Local session in Shotley until March 2019.”
