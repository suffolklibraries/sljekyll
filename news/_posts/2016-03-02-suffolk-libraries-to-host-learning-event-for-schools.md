Suffolk Libraries is holding a learning event for schools and education professionals in the region to help them promote reading as a way of tackling mental health or crisis in young people.

<cite>Building wellness through reading</cite> will bring together a number of exciting and thought-provoking speakers and experts from across the country. Krystal Vittles, Innovation and Development Manager for Suffolk Libraries, said:

> This event will provide schools with a solid understanding of how to develop a reading culture to promote wellness and good mental health amongst their students. We’re really excited about some of the speakers we’ve got lined up and the event is part of our ongoing aims to boost literacy levels and encourage reading for pleasure.

The event is being held at the IP-CITY Centre in Ipswich on Friday 27 May. The keynote speaker is Geoff Barton, Suffolk Headteacher, education consultant and author of a number of books on educational practice. He said:

> Having a strong culture of reading is one of the most important ingredients in any successful school. It isn’t just that reading ability is a big predictor of a child’s future educational and social success. It’s also that a capacity to interpret, empathise and respond to inky words in books and in screens remains one of the most powerful human gifts. We forget at our peril just how urgent literacy is. The conference will be an ideal opportunity to reassert our shared mission for reading and to pick up lots of practical ideas to reinvigorate reading for pleasure across all our schools.

Other speakers at the event include:

  * Juno Dawson – a multi award-winning author of young adult fiction who has recently undertaken a gender transition and has written about the experience for young people.
  * Kate Maryon – an accomplished young adult author who will talk about her personal experience of crisis and how reading and writing helped her through it. Kate’s focus for her writing is to help young people raise their emotional literacy.
  * Speakers from Ofsted, The Reading Agency and National Literacy Trust – the leading mental health charity for young people who will be talking about national research, pilot programmes and help and advocacy to promote good mental health in young people.

There will be an opportunity for discussion and debate and a chance to take part in workshops which will explore some of the day’s main themes. There will also be an opportunity to network and to purchase books from the speakers and get them signed.

The event is £200 per delegate or £175 for schools who already subscribe to Suffolk Libraries Literacy Books and Reading Team for Schools services. Anyone interested will be able to book a place online or email events@suffolklibraries.co.uk for more information.

The launch of the event follows the recent launch of Suffolk Libraries reading campaign for 2016.
