Following a recent consultation with customers, Kedington Library will be changing its opening hours from Friday 17 August.

The total number of opening hours is staying the same, but the library will be closed on Sundays, open on Fridays, and will open and close earlier on Tuesdays. The proposals are designed to provide opening hours which better meet the needs of local people and will fit better with other activities at the community centre where the library is based.

Local people were asked for their views on the proposals before the changes were approved recently by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council. The changes also have support from The Friends of Kedington Library and Kedington Parish Council.

The new opening hours will be:

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 11:30am - 1pm and 1:30pm - 6pm (currently 2pm - 5pm and 5:30pm - 7:30pm)
* Wednesday - 9am - 1pm and 1:30pm - 4:30pm (currently 9am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm)
* Thursday - 1pm - 5pm (currently 11am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm)
* Friday - 11am - 3pm (currently closed)
* Saturday - 9am - 1pm (no change)
* Sunday - closed (currently 1pm - 5pm)
