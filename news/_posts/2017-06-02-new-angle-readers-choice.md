The Ipswich Institute, with support from Suffolk Libraries, has launched a Readers' Choice competition to run alongside the New Angle Prize for Literature.

The New Angle Prize is awarded biennially for works of literary merit associated with or influenced by the region of East Anglia and is sponsored by Gotelee Solicitors and Scrutton Bland Financial Services.

A panel of judges will decide the overall prize winner and runner up, but the Readers' Choice offers people a chance to vote for their own favourite out of the six which have been shortlisted.

You can vote for one title which you feel represents the best of the region’s literature from the past two years via the [Readers' Choice online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/NewAngleReadersChoice) or in person at the Ipswich Institute at 15 Tavern Street, IP1 3AA before Friday 18 August.

The six books include Julia Blackburn’s biography of a Norfolk fisherman-turned-artist [<cite>Threads: The delicate life of John Craske</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1740584), Fiona Melrose's debut novel, [<cite>Midwinter</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2055342), and Rosy Thornton’s collection of short stories, [<cite>Sandlands</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1978720). Also listed are Sarah Perry’s multi-award winning [<cite>The Essex Serpent</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079962), Jill Dawson’s [<cite>The Crime Writer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098880) and Julie Myerson’s [<cite>The Stopped Heart</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079980).

Voters can enter their name into a draw to win two free tickets for the new Angle Prize Awards Dinner on Wednesday 6 September at Hintlesham Golf Club, where the winners of the New Angle Prize Judges’ award and Suffolk Libraries Readers' Choice award will be announced.

There will also be a special Shortlist Showcase event on Wednesday 28 June where the shortlisted authors are invited to an evening of reading and conversation at the Ipswich Institute Reading Room in Tavern Street, Ipswich at 7pm. Tickets are £8 and include refreshments provided by Waitrose, and are available from the Ipswich Institute on [01473 253992](tel:01473253992) or via library@ipswichinstitute.org.uk
