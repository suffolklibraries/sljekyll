Leiston Library is reopening next Tuesday (5 May) after extensive refurbishment and improvement works.

The library has been closed for three weeks and has been completely redecorated with new carpets and shelving being fitted thanks to funding from Leiston Sizewell Community Benefit Fund and the Enabling Communities Fund.

Suffolk Libraries are grateful for customers&#8217; patience during the closure and we hope local people will come in to take a look at the new look library.

**Ends**

**Note to editors:** There will be an official reopening event soon which I&#8217;ll notify you of shortly.
