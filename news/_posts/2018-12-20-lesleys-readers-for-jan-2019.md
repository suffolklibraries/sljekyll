Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>Christmas at the Beach Hut</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2458236), by Veronica Henry:

> "Everyone adores Christmas - especially Lizzy Kingham. But this year, she is feeling unloved and underappreciated by her family. The present-buying, decorating, and food shopping have all been left to her. So she wonders - what would happen if she ran away and left them to it?

> "Lizzy heads to her favourite place: a beach hut on the golden sands of Everdene. There she meets an unlikely collection of new friends, all running away from something. But the spirit of Christmas gets under Lizzy's skin: soon the fairy lights are twinkling and the scent of mulled wine mingles with the sea air.

> "Back at Pepperpot Cottage, her family are desperate to find her. For Christmas isn't Christmas without Lizzy. Can they track her down in time and convince her she means the world to them, every day of the year?"
