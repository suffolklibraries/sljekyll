Nikki Hulse, Business Development Manager at Suffolk Libraries said:

Azzouz El-Mahraoui, Company Director of Coffeelink, said:

"When Suffolk Libraries approached us to talk about a potential partnership, we were both delighted and honoured and we felt a real sense of privilege.”

“We are so excited about the launch of our new venture and we are proud to support Suffolk Libraries. This initiative will help bring communities together in a relaxing central hub at the heart of Ipswich Library in Suffolk.”

The new coffee shop will be available to customers at the following times:

* Monday to Friday - 9am to 5pm
