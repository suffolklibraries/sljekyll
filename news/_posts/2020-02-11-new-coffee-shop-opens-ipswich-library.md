Library users can now enjoy a hot drink or a delicious pastry while browsing books at [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) with the opening of a new Coffeelink café.

The coffee shop at the library on Northgate Street is open to the public as of 11 February.

Nikki Hulse, Business Development Manager at Suffolk Libraries said:

“We’re very excited to welcome Coffeelink to Ipswich County Library and are proud to be working with such a well-loved and ethical local business. We hope library customers will enjoy this new service and that it’ll also bring new people into the library too.”

Azzouz El-Mahraoui, Company Director of Coffeelink, said:

"When Suffolk Libraries approached us to talk about a potential partnership, we were both delighted and honoured and we felt a real sense of privilege.”

“We are so excited about the launch of our new venture and we are proud to support Suffolk Libraries. This initiative will help bring communities together in a relaxing central hub at the heart of Ipswich Library in Suffolk.”

The new coffee shop will be available to customers at the following times:

* Monday to Friday - 9.30am to 4.30pm
* Saturday - 10am to 4pm
