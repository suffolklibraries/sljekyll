Suffolk Libraries has launched a new service to provide advice to people who are missing the opportunity to seek help from staff whilst libraries are closed.

In normal circumstances library staff are usually asked thousands of questions every week. Whether it’s about research, local services, or where to go for help with a particular issue. 

The new online [‘Ask a Librarian’](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/research-and-reference/ask-a-librarian/) service brings together a small team of Suffolk Libraries’ trained and professional librarians who can answer questions from Suffolk residents. 

Kellie Dimmock, Suffolk Libraries Information for Living Librarian is one of the team. She said:

“People may not realise how many questions library staff are asked on a daily basis from local people who find it easier to ask someone they know and trust. With so many of us currently stuck at home, those who aren’t so confident using the internet can now get some more help from Suffolk Libraries. It can sometimes be difficult to find trusted and reliable information online but we’re here to point you in the right direction.” 

Anyone is now welcome to email askalibrarian@suffolklibraries.co.uk and the team will get back to you with an answer. The kind of general questions the service can help with include things like:

* “Where can I go for reliable information about the coronavirus?”
* “Which local organisations can help me with my health or wellbeing?”
* “I’m a parent and need some ideas for entertaining my children.”  

The team will aim to respond to emails within 3-5 days.
