Southwold Library has launched the programme for [Slaughter in Southwold 2018](/slaughter/). A number of top crime writers will be giving talks at the established crime writers’ festival on Saturday 16 and Sunday 17 June.

This year, lucky crime fiction fans can meet Mark Billingham, Martyn Waites, Robert Goddard, Peter Guttridge, Sophie Hannah, Mary-Jane Riley, Stella Rimington, Simon Scarrow and Edward Wilson.

There will also be a range of other activities on offer including a Murder Mystery Night based on <cite>The Wenlock Mummy</cite> by Elly Griffiths, a crime quiz and a chance to have lunch with the visiting authors. For the first time there will also be screenings of a series of classic crime film double bills in the days leading up to the festival.

The event takes place at Southwold Arts Centre and is part of Southwold Arts Festival. It is organised by Southwold Library manager Charlotte Clark with support from the Friends of Southwold Library and the Crime Writers' Association.

Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark said: “I’m really excited about this year’s programme, which is bigger and better than ever. I hope that screening some classic crime movies in the run up to the festival will help to get everyone in the mood. The event is a big part of the Suffolk calendar now and I hope as many people as possible come along to Southwold and enjoy it.”

Slaughter in Southwold has been so successful that it has inspired Stowmarket Library to organise their own crime writers' festival. [Skulduggery in Stowmarket](/skulduggery/) takes place at the library this weekend (26 - 30 April).
