The Friends of Great Cornard Community Library have been marking a double celebration recently.

Joan Herbert, a member of the Friends group, which works to support and develop the library, was 80 on 25 November and was presented with flowers, cards and a cake. Joan is a valued member of the library community – she is also a member of the library’s Top Time group, a summer reading challenge volunteer and helps out on craft and activity days.

This celebration came two days after the birth of the library’s newest member, Nathan Easting, whose mum Kelly-Jane is the Friends group’s treasurer. Nathan visited the library on 27 November where he was signed up as a Suffolk Libraries member and received his first library card.
