We would like to advise customers of our library opening hours over the Easter weekend:

- Friday 14 April - closed
- Saturday 15 April - open as usual
- Sunday 16 April - closed
- Monday 17 April - closed

Please note these are general opening hours and we recommend that you refer to specific opening hours for [your local library](/libraries).

If your library loan is due back on a Bank Holiday we will automatically extend the return date until when the library is open again. Donâ€™t forget you can also [renew and reserve items on our website](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/), or [use our online services](/elibrary).

You can also call us on [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) or email us at **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.
