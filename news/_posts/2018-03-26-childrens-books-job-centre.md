Any parents or carers visiting Ipswich Jobcentre with their children can now enjoy a small selection of children’s books thanks to a donation from Suffolk Libraries.

We have donated a number of good quality withdrawn children's books to keep children amused while their parents or carers use the centre's services.

Philip Carter-Goodyear, Suffolk Family Focus manager and work coach team leader at the Jobcentre, said: “We are delighted to receive these books from Suffolk Libraries. We want to ensure that our Jobcentre is as welcoming as possible. Many of our customers attend with their children and by providing these books we hope to make their visits easier.

"We would like to thank Suffolk Libraries for their kind generosity and for their continued commitment to working together to help us create a cohesive, supportive community and to spread the enjoyment of reading as widely as possible.”

Krystal Vittles, Suffolk Libraries development manager and children’s lead, said: “We are really pleased to be part of this project. It is so important to encourage children to read as much as possible and providing books to other spaces who see children and young people on a daily basis is a really effective way of normalising reading for families.

"By providing books we also aim to make visits to the Jobcentre a more interesting experience for children and young people as it can sometimes be a lengthy visit. Suffolk Libraries and the Jobcentre share a goal of helping people reach their potential and providing books to promote reading for pleasure goes a long way to achieve this.”
