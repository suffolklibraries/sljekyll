This April marks 50 years since [Felixstowe Library](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/felixstowe-library) opened for the first time.

The library will be marking this milestone in several ways.

The celebrations will kick off with a visit from Felixstowe Community Choir on Saturday 23 April from 11am to 12noon. This is also the same day as World Book night. This very special one-off performance is a real treat as the choir are in great demand. On the day the library will also be decorated with memorabilia from 1966 with staff dressed in clothes from the 1960’s and music from the same era.

There will be a 1966 quiz running throughout the month. It costs £1 to enter and any money raised will help to support the library. The winners will be announced on 30 April and there are great prizes to be won.

Look out for a special exhibition about the history of the library and if you want to contribute there&#8217;s also a celebration box in the library for anyone to post their memories, photos or comments.

Felixstowe Library is also hosting an afternoon with local crime author Alison Bruce on Saturday 30 April at 2pm with doors opening at 1.30pm. She will be talking about her Cambridge-based crime novels and will be signing copies of her books. Tickets are £5 and must be booked in advance.

A recent comment from a customer:

> Felixstowe Library is a fantastic asset to our local community. The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. The range of groups/activities for ALL ages and sections of the community is outstanding.
