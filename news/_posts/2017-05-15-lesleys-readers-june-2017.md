Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with
journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers Monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>Mothering Sunday</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1890577), by Graham Swift:

> "It is March 30th 1924. It is Mothering Sunday. How will Jane Fairchild, orphan and housemaid, occupy her time when she has no mother to visit? How, shaped by the events of this never to be forgotten day, will her future unfold?"

If you've read the book, why not join in the discussion at 2:30pm
