On Saturday 7 November, Suffolk Libraries will be showcasing its free digital music service across all 44 of the county’s libraries.

Freegal is a free digital music service offered by Suffolk Libraries that allows customers to download free music direct to their device or computer every week from a catalogue of over six million. Once downloaded you can keep the tracks forever and also transfer them into iTunes.

The Freegal Day on 7 November will involve all the county’s libraries playing music from the Freegal catalogue to celebrate and promote this free service which has recently been extended to include unlimited music streaming.

In the evening of 7 November, Ipswich County Library is also hosting a live music gig with acclaimed Americana band Police Dog Hogan playing live in the library. The latest Police Dog Hogan album is available on Freegal and tickets for the gig are available for £12 online or via Ipswich Library.

Freegal (named because it’s free and legal!) was launched by Suffolk Libraries two years ago. Customers are now using the service to download over 4,500 songs a month and stream over 10,000 tracks. There is also an option to download music videos.

The Freegal catalogue features over 6 million tracks including top artists from a wide range of genres and also includes the entire Sony Music catalogue.

Suffolk Libraries Information and Content Librarian, Lisa Brennan said:

> Our Freegal day aims to give customers a taste of the free music on offer from this fantastic free service, if they’ve not discovered it already. Staff will be on hand to answer questions and there will be an opportunity to browse and listen to songs. Freegal is available to anyone with a Suffolk Libraries card and with over 6 million songs to choose from there is something for everyone.

Freegal features:

* Download up to five free MP3 music tracks a week (or two music videos)
* Keep downloaded tracks forever and transfer them into the media player of your choice
* Stream unlimited free music

For more information visit [our Freegal website](http://www.suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com) or [our eLibrary page](/elibrary/). Anyone wanting to use the service who hasn’t already got a Suffolk Libraries card can sign up for free online or at any library. All you need to access Freegal is a Suffolk Libraries membership number.
