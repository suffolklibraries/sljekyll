Suffolk Libraries is pleased to be working with Sutton Hoo to host a series of roadshows over the next few months whilst the world famous site is closed for major development work.

Sutton Hoo will be closing from October until spring 2019 as work gets underway on a £4 million project to transform the site called ‘Releasing the Sutton Hoo Story’.

To ensure that people can continue discovering the story of the Anglo-Saxons who buried their king in Suffolk, the Sutton Hoo team will be embarking on an ambitious roadshow that will see them visiting libraries, schools, supermarkets and other venues around the county.

The stunning replica helmet, buckle and shoulder clasp will be joining them on the road and the team will be on hand to talk about the site – both its fascinating history and its exciting future.

Although the details are still being finalised the following library events have been confirmed so far:

* [6 October - Saxmundham Library](/events/saxmundham-2018-10-06-sutton-hoo/)
