Suffolk Libraries is pleased to be working with the National Trust's Sutton Hoo to host a series of roadshows over the next few months whilst the world famous site is closed for major development work.

Sutton Hoo has now closed until Spring 2019 as work gets underway on a £4 million Heritage Lottery funded project to transform the site called ‘Releasing the Sutton Hoo Story’.

To ensure that people can continue discovering the story of the Anglo-Saxons who buried their king in Suffolk, the Sutton Hoo team will be embarking on an ambitious roadshow that will see them visiting libraries, schools, supermarkets and other venues around the county.

The roadshows will include a chance to see the stunning replica artefacts including the famous Sutton Hoo helmet, buckle and shoulder clasp, there will also be activities for children and expert talks about both the site’s fascinating history and its exciting future.

James Powell, spokesman for Suffolk Libraries said: "We’re really excited to be hosting these roadshows in our libraries. It’s a fantastic idea to bring the treasures of one of the county’s most significant historic sites out to the community while the site is closed and the team at Sutton Hoo have a range of engaging activities planned which I’m sure will be very popular."

Allison Girling, property operations manager for Sutton Hoo said: "Closing the site for the work to take place is an essential, so we decided that if visitors can’t go to Sutton Hoo, then Sutton Hoo will go to them.

"As well as an unusual way to meet the team and discover more about the Sutton Hoo story, it’s also a rare opportunity to see some of our exhibition items up close, ask questions and imagine what life must have been like for a Suffolk king in Anglo-Saxon times."
