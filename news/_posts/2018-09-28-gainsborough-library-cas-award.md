The Community Action Suffolk (CAS) Awards were held at the [Museum of East Anglian Life](http://eastanglianlife.org.uk/) this week to honour organisations and individuals who have gone above and beyond in their volunteering commitment.

Gainsborough Community Library provides a wide range of activities and services to the local community for people of all ages and acts a hub for the local community. There are many volunteering opportunities at the library including the [Voices for Gainsborough Community Library](/about/member-organisations/voices-for-gainsborough-community-library/) which supports the library and volunteer-run café.

Mandy Grimwood, manager of Gainsborough Library, said: “We’re thrilled with this award and I’d like to thank everyone who is involved in supporting the library. In a year which has been very challenging for this part of Ipswich, I think it’s a reflection of the important role our library plays in in bringing people together in our local community.”

Gainsborough Library was nominated by Carol Debman from the Voices for Gainsborough Community Library.

Every year, CAS calls for nominations to help recognise the people and campaigns which are helping to make a difference across the region. This year’s haul of CAS award nominations saw an exceptional entry level, with suggestions coming in for libraries, hospital projects, youth centres and countless young people who are contributing to their towns and villages in Suffolk.

On the same night of the CAS awards, one volunteer from Gainsborough Library, Colin Mayes, received a Suffolk Libraries Friends Group Volunteer of the Year award at the [Suffolk Libraries AGM](/news/agm-report/).
