Suffolk Libraries is taking part in a project to host a pop-up exhibition on the origins, means and future of the act of writing.

The [Writing: Making your Mark exhibition](https://www.bl.uk/events/writing-making-your-mark) will open at the British Library on Friday 26 April, with free pop-up exhibitions starting a tour of libraries around the country on the same day.

The Suffolk exhibition will start at Ipswich County Library and then move on to Bury, Lowestoft and Felixstowe libraries, finishing at the end of August. Through images of carved stone inscriptions, medieval manuscripts and early printed works, the family-focused pop-up displays will span five millennia and five continents to deconstruct the act of writing and consider its future in the digital age. The exhibition dates for each library follow:

* Ipswich County Library: 26 April - 17 May
* Bury St Edmunds Library: 31 May - 21 June
* Lowestoft Library: 5 July - 26 July
* [Felixstowe Library: 9 August - 27 August](/events/felixstowe-2019-08-09-writing-making-your-mark/)

The exhibition is organised through the [Living Knowledge Network](https://www.bl.uk/projects/living-knowledge), an innovative partnership of public libraries working in collaboration with the British Library, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales. Suffolk Libraries is part of this network which shares resources, skills and ideas, promotes the enduring values of libraries, and aims to benefit the millions of people who use public libraries in the UK every day.

Liz Jolly, chief librarian at the British Library, said: "The Living Knowledge Network is a unique partnership of national and public libraries united by a shared vision to bring knowledge alive for everyone and we are delighted to be to be working with 22 libraries across the UK to share the British Library’s exhibition, <cite>Writing: Making your Mark</cite>.

"We are looking forward to building on the success of the [first Living Knowledge Network display](/news/history-of-magic/), which was based on the British Library’s Harry Potter: A History of Magic exhibition and welcomed over 775,000 visitors between 2017 and 2018."
