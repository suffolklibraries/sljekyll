This October, [Film Feast](https://filmfeast.co.uk/) will be bringing three films and delicious dishes from local and independent businesses to Ipswich County and Woodbridge libraries.

The screenings are being presented in association with our Arts Council funded programme, [BLOC](/bloc/). Suffolk Libraries creative programmes manager Melissa Matthews said:

"We are really excited about this collaboration with Film Feast and having the chance to bring these types of events to our libraries. Libraries are relaxed spaces and we want to change people’s perceptions of what they have to offer their communities. We are absolutely going for it with the cosy autumn vibes and cannot wait to collaborate with our favourite local cafés."

The events are as follows:

* <cite>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</cite> at Ipswich County Library with sweet treats from East of England Co-op - Saturday 5 October
* <cite>Brooklyn</cite> at Ipswich County Library with New York style bagels and Guinness cake from Applaud Coffee - Saturday 5 October
* <cite>When Harry Met Sally</cite> at Woodbridge Library with New York style foodie classics from The Cooks Shed - 6 October
