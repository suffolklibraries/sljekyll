We're proposing to increase the opening hours at Kesgrave Library and are would like to know local people's views.

The proposals are a response to the increasing popularity of and local demand for the library. The potential change would add two additional sessions to the library's opening hours, meaning it would be open for at least six hours more every week.

Before making the changes, we're keen to ask as many local people as possible which of the following options would be the most useful to them:

* The library opening on either Monday or Wednesday morning; and
* The library opening on either Monday or Friday afternoon.

You can have your say by completing a survey in the library or completing [our online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/kesgraveincrease) by 21 April.

Any changes would have to be approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.
