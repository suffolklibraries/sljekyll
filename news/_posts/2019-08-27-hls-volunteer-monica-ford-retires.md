Broomhill Library volunteer Monica Ford recently retired after 32 years of delivering library books to people in their homes. Manager David Cook and volunteer engagement manager Diane Moore presented her with a card and flowers on behalf of Suffolk Libraries to thank her all she has done for us over the years.

Monica said: "It all started with a poster at my local library asking for volunteers. And I thought to myself 'If I one day couldn’t get out of the house, I'd want people to bring me books.'

"At first I only visited people in their homes, mainly. Over the years, I visited local care homes as well. It's sometimes difficult to know what they want at first, what type of books they’re interested in, but then you get to know them and find out what they like.”

With a fond smile, Monica recalled how she’d be missed if she ever couldn’t visit one week. "If I hadn’t been for a week, when I would arrive they’d say 'It's about time! I’d just run out of books!'"

She added: "I learned to be a bit more tolerant and understanding of people. It's been enjoyable and I would recommend it, it’s just a nice thing to do."

If you would like to volunteer for the [Home Library Service](/mobiles-home/home/), or you or someone you know would like to receive it, contact your [local library](/libraries/) or email **hls@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
