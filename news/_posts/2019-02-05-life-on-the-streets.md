Ipswich County Library is currently hosting an exhibition of photographs taken by local people affected by homelessness.

The exhibition has been organised by the charity Volunteering Matters as part of their Perspectives project in partnership with Essex Partnership University Foundation Trust (EPUT), whose health care services have been accessed by the photographers.

The Life on the Streets exhibition is on display on the ground floor of the library until the end of February. It aims to engage with and give a voice to some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community. Everyone is welcome to come and take a look, and there is also a comments book inviting people to share their reaction to the exhibition.

Fiona Hanlon, mental health specialist at Volunteering Matters said: "Many of the photographers have said that when you are homeless every day is the same 'groundhog day' and that boredom is a huge issue. Being involved in the project has given participants a chance to do something positive and creative, work as part of a team and many have uncovered a talent they didnâ€™t know they had.

"These pictures reflect the diversity, talent, hopes and hardships of a unique group of individuals and we are very proud and excited to share them with the public."
