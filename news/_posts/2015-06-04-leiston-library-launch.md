Leiston Library is hosting a celebration event on Tuesday 9 June to mark the library’s recent reopening and refurbishment.

The event takes place on Tuesday 9 June from 2pm to 3pm. The library in the town’s main street has been completely redecorated with new carpets and shelving being fitted thanks to funding from Leiston Sizewell Community Benefit Fund and the Enabling Communities Fund.

The library reopened in May after a three-week closure and this event is being held to showcase the new library to local people and thank everyone who helped with the redecoration including library staff and volunteers.
