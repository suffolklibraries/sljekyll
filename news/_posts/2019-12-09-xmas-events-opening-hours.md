In the lead-up to Christmas, you're invited to join in the festive cheer with a range of seasonal events.

All Suffolk libraries will be closed on 24, 25 and 26 December, and 1 January 2020.

If [your local library](/libraries/) normally stays open late on Tuesdays, it will be closing at the earlier time of 5pm on Tuesday 31 December.

Several libraries are celebrating Christmas with special events. Highlights include:

* Opportunities to meet Father Christmas at Haverhill, Lowestoft and Sudbury libraries
* A chance for 0-5 year-olds and their parents/carers to meet owls, hear stories and enjoy seasonal refreshments at Suffolk Owl Sanctuary, with staff from Stowmarket Library
* Christmas tree festivals at Stowmarket and Thurston libraries
* Festive family film screenings at Ipswich County Library
* A very special community pantomime at Chantry Methodist Church starring members of library staff!

A list of festive events across our libraries follows.
