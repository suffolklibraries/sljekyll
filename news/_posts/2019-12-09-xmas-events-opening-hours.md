All Suffolk libraries will be closed on 24, 25 and 26 December, and 1 January 2020.

If [your local library](/libraries/) normally stays open late on Tuesdays, it will be closing at the earlier time of 5pm on Tuesday 31 December.

We'd like to wish all our customers a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
