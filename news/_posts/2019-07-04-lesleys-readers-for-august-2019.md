Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>Death in the Dordogne</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1940622), by Martin Walker:

> "When an old man, head of an immigrant North African family, is found murdered, suspicion falls on the son of a St Denis doctor, found in flagrante playing sex games surrounded by Nazi paraphernalia. But chief of police, Captain Bruno Courreges, isn't convinced and instead suspects this crime may have its roots in that most tortured period of recent French history - the Second World War, a time of terror and betrayal that set brother against brother."
