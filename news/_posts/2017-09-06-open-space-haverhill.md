Haverhill Library has launched new Open Space sessions to encourage people to come along and talk about their health and wellbeing.

The Open Space sessions are a joint project between Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, Suffolk Libraries and Julian Support and have been a success at [Ipswich](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) and [Bury St Edmunds](/libraries/bury-st-edmunds-library/) libraries.

Open Space sessions run at Haverhill Library every Friday from 12:30pm to 2:30pm and provide a relaxed and informal opportunity to drop in to listen, chat and think. Free tea and coffee is provided and people can come and go as they please during the sessions, with no pressure to attend every week.

The sessions aim to encourage people to talk about their mental health and wellbeing, a subject which still has a stigma attached for many. The sessions are very relaxed and anyone interested in coming along to find out more would be very welcome.

Anyone who drops in can contribute their views and ideas, try out new activities, get to know new people and find out about local events and resources they might benefit from.

The sessions have been launched as part of Suffolk Libraries New Chapters service which helps people to access health and wellbeing information via their local library. For more information contact [Haverhill Library](/libraries/haverhill-library/) or email **mentalhealth@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
