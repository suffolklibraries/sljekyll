<p>Several libraries in Suffolk are holding colourful events to celebrate Elmer the Patchwork Elephant this month.</p>

<p>Elmer Day celebrates the ongoing popularity of the colourful elephant who has featured in over 30 books by David McKee. Elmer Day is also a celebration of reading, elephants and accepting yourself and others. Activities will be taking place across the country with children being encouraged to dress up in bright colours.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1765621">first Elmer book</a> was published in 1989. It was inspired by an incident where McKeeâ€™s mixed-race daughter was verbally abused. His stories promote acceptance both in other people and ourselves and have sold millions of copies round the world.</p>

<p>Elmer Day takes place on Saturday 26 May, with many libraries holding events on or around this date:</p>

{% assign elmer-events = (site.events | where: "event-category", "elmer-day" | sort: "event-start-date" ) %}

{% for event in elmer-events %}

    <article class="{% include /c/listing.html %}">

        <h1 class="{% include /c/listing-title.html %}"><a href="{{ event.url }}">{{ event.name }}</a></h1>

        <p class="{% include /c/page-meta.html %}">

            <span>{{ event.event-start-date | date: "%a %-d %b" }}</span> - {{ event.event-end-date | date: "%a %-d %b" }} <span>{{ event.event-start-time }}</span>
