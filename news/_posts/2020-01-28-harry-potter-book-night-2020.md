Harry Potter Book Night is back this February. Libraries across Suffolk will once again be hosting events in celebration of the bestselling books by J. K. Rowling.

The annual event officially takes place on Thursday 6 February, with a number of our libraries hosting games and crafts based on the series on or around this date.

Sophie Green, Suffolk Libraries Stock Librarian, said: "The Harry Potter titles are incredibly popular and magical books. Each year they are revisited as old favourites by generations as well as being discovered for the first time by those lucky muggles who have yet to explore the fantastic world of Hogwarts and beyond."

A list of confirmed Harry Potter themed events follows.
