**Suffolk Libraries are celebrating the most successful Summer Reading Challenge ever!**

Over 8,260 children signed up to take part in this year’s reading challenge, which has lived up to the theme of the ‘Big Friendly Read’, proving hugely popular with young children across the county. The Roald Dahl inspired theme, together with a wide range of engaging, fun activities has encouraged primary school aged children to visit libraries and read up to six books over the summer holidays.

The Summer Reading Challenge is coordinated by the Reading Agency and run in libraries across the UK. In Suffolk libraries it has increased in popularity year on year with more children taking part each year since 2012. Last year the number signing up was 8,226, in 2014 it was 8,100 and the number was 7,800 in 2013. The final figures for 2016 are likely to be even higher as libraries are still inputting their data.

This year hundreds of older children have also enjoyed a new activity in libraries called ImagiNation which asked them to create artwork based on books they have read.

All children who have managed to read all six will be receiving medals and certificates at special presentations in the county’s libraries and the fun will continue with more events taking place in libraries to celebrate Roald Dahl Day on 13 September which would have been the authors 100th birthday.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, welcomed the news: “We’re delighted to have again seen an increase in the number of children taking part in the Summer Reading Challenge. The Reading Agency have again created a very popular theme this year and it’s wonderful to see so many children and families visiting libraries to take part. The Summer Reading Challenge showcases the very best of what the library service has to offer – it promotes reading and literacy in a fun way, encourages families to visit libraries, and our wonderful staff create a range of inspired activities to support it throughout the summer.”
