Two top children’s authors will be inspiring young bookworms from schools across the county on Friday as they compete in the final of Suffolk Libraries annual search to find the county’s best read pupils.

This Friday (6 May) is the final of the 21st Suffolk Book Mastermind which is organised by [Suffolk Libraries Literacy, Books and Reading Team for Schools](/schools-literacy/schools/) which works with schools to provide them with expert reading advice and resources.

Suffolk Book Mastermind is also supported by the [Suffolk Book League](http://www.sbl.org.uk). This year’s competition has involved students from 29 schools across the county competing in earlier rounds for a chance to represent their school in the final.

The event takes place on Friday 6 May at the Riverside Centre in Stratford St Andrew will involves pupils from eight different schools, with their fellow students cheering them on. To win the final, pupils from each school have to answer questions on their chosen book and then a series of general knowledge questions including a picture round.

In the afternoon popular children’s authors Hayley Long and Chris Priestley will be talking to the students about their writing careers. Hayley was born in Suffolk and is the author of the popular Lottie Biggs stories. Her most recent book 'Sophie Someone' was shortlisted for the 2015 Costa Children's Book Award. Chris Priestley’ books have been nominated for many awards including the Edgar Awards, the UKLA Children's Book Award and the Carnegie Medal. His stories include the award-winning and critically-acclaimed Tales of Terror series.

The Literacy Books and Reading Team for Schools (formerly the Schools Library Service) works closely with schools, school librarians and public libraries. The service aims to support children’s literacy and reading for pleasure as this is an important part of their academic and personal development. This is the 21st annual Book Mastermind. The event is a celebration of books and reading, giving young people a fun opportunity to test their book knowledge and general knowledge.

Both Hayley Long and Chris Priestley have been interviewed for Suffolk Libraries’ Beyond the Book blogs:
