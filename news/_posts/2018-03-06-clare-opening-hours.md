We're asking people living in and around Clare their views on potential changes to the library’s opening hours.

The total number of opening hours would stay the same under the proposals, but the library would be open on Friday mornings and offer more consistent and regular hours during the week.

Before making any changes, we want to canvas local people's views. We're also interested in your use of and thoughts about Clare Library. We're inviting you to [complete our online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ClareLibrary18) or fill in a paper form from the library by 28 March.

**The proposed changes and opening hours are as follows:**

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Wednesday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Thursday - closed (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 12:30pm - 5pm)
* Saturday - 10am - 1pm (currently 9:30am - 1pm)
* Sunday - 10am - 2pm (currently 11am - 4pm)

Any changes to the opening hours will have to be approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council in 2018.
