Following recent consultations with customers, [Kessingland](/libraries/kessingland-library/) and [Rosehill](/libraries/rosehill-library/) libraries will be changing their opening hours from Monday 3 February. Both libraries' total number of opening hours will remain the same.

**Kessingland Library** will be opening half an hour earlier and closing two hours earlier on Tuesdays, and opening half an hour later and closing two hours later on Saturdays. This better meets customer demand, which is higher on Saturday afternoons than Tuesday evenings, and improves staff safety by reducing lone working time in the evening.

**The new opening times for Kessingland Library are as follows:**

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 2pm - 5pm (currently 2:30pm - 7pm)
* Wednesday - 10am - 5pm (no change)
* Thursday - closed (no change)
* Friday - 10am - 5pm (no change)
* Saturday - 10am - 3pm (currently 9:30am - 1pm)
* Sunday - 10am - 3pm (no change)

**Rosehill Library** will be opening 30 minutes earlier on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and closing an hour and a half earlier on Fridays. This meets customer requests for earlier opening times and improves staff safety by reducing lone working time in the evening.

**The new opening times for Rosehill Library are as follows:**

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 9:30am - 5pm (no change)
* Wednesday - 9am - 5pm (currently 9:30am - 5pm)
* Thursday - 9am - 5pm (currently 9:30am - 5pm)
* Friday - 9am - 6pm (currently 9:30am - 7:30pm)
* Saturday - 9:30am - 5pm (no change)
* Sunday - 11am - 4pm (no change)

New signage will be implemented at the libraries in the near future to reflect this change.
