Suffolk Libraries is launching a wedding venue with a difference.

Ipswich County Library’s Northgate Room is now licensed to hold weddings, civil ceremonies and other celebrations.

The library’s Northgate Room is the library’s most attractive and striking room. Normally used as the library’s study and reference area, the room is now available to hire for your special day.

To launch the new venue Suffolk Libraries is running a competition to offer a free hire for the best love story. All you need to do is write between 100-200 words on why you’d like to hold your celebration in the library and what your library means to you. The winner will be able to hold their wedding, naming ceremony, renewal of vows, commitment ceremony or civil partnership free of charge.

The room can hold up to 40 people and has a full licence from Suffolk Registrars for weddings and the other celebrations listed above.

Ipswich County Library is a listed building which is 92 years old this year. Its Northgate Room is 100ft long with a vaulted ceiling and old oak bookshelves and tables. It’s a room which celebrates Suffolk’s cultural heritage and historic significance with several coloured glass windows depicting famous historic literary figures, scientists, politicians, artists, soldiers and sailors with links to Suffolk – including life size images of Geoffrey Chaucer, Francis Bacon and Thomas Wolsey.

There are also many other smaller coloured glass panels marking the arms of Suffolk towns and commercial families from the county.

Marion Harvey, Manager of Ipswich County Library, said:

> The Northgate Room is a beautiful part of the library and we think it offers a unique and historic venue for ceremonies in the heart of Ipswich. It would be a great choice for book lovers, regular library customers or anyone looking for a reasonably priced venue with a difference. We’re hoping it will also provide some additional income to support the library.

Thanks to the support of Suffolk Bridal and Bedwells Florist the library has already hosted a dress rehearsal wedding to showcase how the room would look for a real ceremony.

The Northgate Room will be available to hire for £350 on Fridays and Saturday and £300 Monday to Thursday. This price covers the hire of the room but not the Registrars or other associated costs. The ceremony license also covers the library’s Lecture Hall and Enterprise and Innovation Hub which are also available for hire.

Anyone interested in booking the venue is encouraged to arrange a visit by contacting Ipswich County Library on 01473 263815 or emailing **ceremonies@suffolklibraries.co.uk**. There are also photos of the room and how it would look for a wedding together with more information about booking the room at [www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/ceremonies](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/ceremonies).
