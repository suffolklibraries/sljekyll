We’re looking for people who love their library and are prepared to tell us about their experience of using our services.

Would you or your family or group be happy to your photo taken or maybe even filmed talking about what their libraries mean to you or the difference they may have made to your lives? Perhaps you’ve had a really positive experience in one of our libraries you’d be happy to talk to us about?

We think sharing the stories of the people who use libraries is a really powerful way of showing their value to local communities and encouraging more people to visit libraries and make the most of the huge range of services and activities we offer.

If you’re interested in talking to us please contact our customer services team by calling [01473351249](tel:01473351249) or emailing **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
