Three Suffolk libraries will be taking visitors on a journey to where magic and myth began with Harry Potter: A History of Magic.

Have you ever wanted to delve into Divination, ponder the peculiarities of Potions and discover magical creatures? Now you can. A regional display of a selection of images from the British Library's Harry Potter: A History of Magic exhibition will be on show at Ipswich County Library, Haverhill Library and Felixstowe Library this autumn.

The display has been created in association with the British Library throughout the Living Knowledge Network, an innovative partnership with 21 major libraries across the UK. It is the first major project for this Arts Council England funded partnership, and celebrates and explores the historical, folkloric and mythological origins of magic that J. K. Rowling draws on in the creation of her wizarding world. It also celebrates the 20-year legacy of the publishing phenomenon of Harry Potter and will be accompanied by a new Suffolk Libraries book collection.

The display will be touring the three libraries from October to February as follows:

* [Ipswich County Library – 20 October-4 December](/events/ipswich-2017-10-20-history-of-magic/)
* [Haverhill Library – 8-31 December](/events/haverhill-2017-12-08-history-of-magic/)
* [Felixstowe Library – 5 January-5 February 2018](/events/felixstowe-2018-01-05-history-of-magic/)

There will also be an opportunity to take selfies with the display and join in the conversation online with #BLHarryPotter.

Ipswich County Library will be livestreaming two British Library Hogwarts Curriculum lectures: [Astronomy with Maggie Aderin-Pocock on 29 October](/events/ipswich-2017-10-29-astronomy-lecture/) and [Herbology with Anna Pavord on 12 November](/events/ipswich-2017-11-12-herbology-lecture/).

Harry Potter: A History of Magic is a major exhibition at The British Library in partnership with Bloomsbury. It is open in London from 20 October 2017–28 February 2018. If the Suffolk Libraries display whets your appetite for the full exhibition experience, you can book your ticket on [the British Library's website](https://bl.uk).
