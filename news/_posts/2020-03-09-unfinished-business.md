Suffolk Libraries is celebrating International Women’s Day by announcing a series of events as part of the [<cite>British Library’s ‘Unfinished Business: The Fight for Women’s Rights’ exhibition</cite>](https://www.bl.uk/events/unfinished-business) this spring.

Suffolk Libraries is part of the British Library’s Living Knowledge Network and will be hosting a version of its national exhibition in three of the county’s libraries. This will involve pop-up display panels, along with exhibitions and other events at [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/), [Lowestoft Library](/libraries/lowestoft-library/) and [Bury St Edmunds Library](/libraries/bury-st-edmunds-library/) between April and August.

The exhibition explores how contemporary fights for gender equality and liberation in the UK have their roots in the long and complex history of women’s activism and campaigning. It will include items ranging from personal diaries, letters, banners and protest fashion, to subversive literature, film, music and art.

As well as the exhibition panels, the three libraries will be hosting events including other artwork, film screenings and author talks.  Dr Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emily Pankhurst, founder of the UK Suffragette movement will also be visiting the exhibition at Ipswich Library in April.  

Suffolk Libraries has also published [special lists of films and music](/new-suggestions/articles/unfinished-business-elibrary-titles/) with an Unfinished Business theme which are available to stream via its [Kanopy](/elibrary/kanopy/) and [Freegal eLibrary services](/elibrary/freegal/). Recommended lists of books will also be published when the exhibition is launched in April.

Melissa Matthews, Creative Programmes Manager for Suffolk Libraries said:  

“At Suffolk Libraries our female staff represent 84% of our overall workforce. The equality and respect that we expect daily is as a result of those who have had to fight for equality. Inspired by those who paved the way, Suffolk Libraries will be using this exhibition to invite discussions about battles not yet won and recognising that inequality is experienced differently depending on race, gender identity, class and sexuality. This exhibition celebrates those who have struggled to overcome the barriers to living a fully-realised life. Suffolk Libraries looks forward to inviting our communities to add their voices to the many fighting for a fairer world for everyone.”
