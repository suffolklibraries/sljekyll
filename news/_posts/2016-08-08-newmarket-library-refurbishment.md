Newmarket Library will be getting a makeover this autumn with an extensive refurbishment planned for September.  The refurbishment work is being funded by developer contribution money and fundraising by the Friends of Newmarket library and Newmarket library staff, and will involve new carpet tiles, redecoration, a new library counter and new wheeled shelving.

Whilst the work is taking place, the library will have to close for three weeks from Monday 12 September to Monday 3 October, reopening on Tuesday 4th October. The aim is to carry out the work after the end of the Summer Reading Challenge.

Kate Ashton, manager of Newmarket Library said, “This is an exciting time for Newmarket Library. The new counter and mobile shelving will make the space within the library much more flexible and enable us to offer a variety of activities. I am delighted that the hard work and fundraising by the Friends group, library staff and previous manager, Grace Myers-Crump has enabled us to purchase the new shelving, which will also have images of Newmarket, its history and heritage on its ends. We have been fortunate to receive kind and generous support from Peter Norman and Newmarket Local History Society, Newmarket Racecourse, Cyril Coombes, Phil Fuller at the Newmarket Journal and Jockey Club Estates who have all donated the pictures to make this possible.”

Suffolk Libraries apologises to any customers for the inconvenience during the closure and is advising local people of the interim arrangements. 

Customers can use their library cards at any other Suffolk Library (the nearest are Mildenhall, Haverhill and Bury St Edmunds).

People can also use the [Suffolk Libraries website](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk) to renew books or reserve them and there is a free eBook and eMagazine download service. Any library loans due back during the closure will have their return date automatically amended until after the library reopens.
