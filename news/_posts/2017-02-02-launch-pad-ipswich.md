Ipswich County Library will be hosting ‘Launch Pad’ sessions in March which aim to giving people the skills they need to find work.

Six free sessions will be taking place over two weeks on 7, 9, 14, 16, 21 and 23 March, running from 10am to 3pm on each day. The sessions will be running in the library’s Enterprise Hub.

Suffolk Libraries are working in partnership with [Realise Futures](http://www.realisefutures.org/) to deliver the sessions, which are aimed at local people who are not currently in work. They will cover essential subjects such as numeracy, literacy, digital skills and other key skills. Please contact Ipswich Library to book a place.
