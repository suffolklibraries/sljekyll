Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with
journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers Monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1314856"><cite>The Last Runaway</cite></a>, by Tracy Chevalier:

> "When Quaker Honor Bright sails from Bristol with her sister, she is fleeing heartache for a new life in America, far from home. But tragedy leaves her alone and vulnerable, torn between two worlds and dependent on the kindness of strangers, and life in 1850s Ohio is precarious and unsentimental."

If you've read the book, why not join in the discussion at 2:30pm
