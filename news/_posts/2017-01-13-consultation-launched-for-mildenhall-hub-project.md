Mildenhall residents are being asked for their views on plans for a new ‘Mildenhall Hub’ which would involve a number of local services being delivered on one site, including the relocation of the library.

The Mildenhall Hub would involve the creation of a new school, leisure facility and health centre in Sheldrick Way. As well as a new library, the Hub would also house council offices for Forest Heath District and Suffolk County councils, emergency services, a pre-school and adult learning space, as well as the Citizens’ Advice Bureau and the Department for Work and Pensions.

The project could provide several benefits for the library:

* It would create a modern library space, closer to the town centre

* Being based in a shared building with other organisations has worked successfully in other places and the library is likely to attract new visitors who come to access other services.

* There will be a better space for library activities

* The hub could provide new and exciting opportunities to work together with other organisations based there.

There is an opportunity for local people to comment on the initial plans before a planning application is submitted in the spring. Full details on the project and the consultation can be found at [http://www.mildenhallhub.info/](http://www.mildenhallhub.info/)
