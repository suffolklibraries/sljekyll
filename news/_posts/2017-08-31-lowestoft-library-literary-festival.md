The UK’s most easterly literary festival, The Lowestoft Library Literary Festival, returns on Saturday 7 October with another stellar line-up.

The event, which takes place in the library, has been organised by the Friends of Lowestoft Library for the past few years. The programme features biologist and primatologist Ben Garrod, who has recently appeared on television presenting the documentary <cite>The Day the Dinosaurs Died</cite>, household favourite presenter, author and journalist Libby Purves, poet and translator George Szirtes and historical author Simon Scarrow.

Beverley Cadby of the Friends of Lowestoft Library said: “The Friends committee are delighted and very excited to announce a list of well-respected authors to please all tastes and ages. We are fortunate to be able to present this strong line-up and would encourage anyone interested to book their tickets as soon as possible as space will be limited.”
