This year's World Book Day (Thursday 1 March) has the message 'Share a Story' and we have picked out [some great books to share with children](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/wbd-list-2018/).

This is the 21st World Book Day, an annual celebration of authors, illustrators, books and (most importantly) reading. It’s the biggest celebration of its kind and is marked all over the world.

The main aim of World Book Day is to encourage children to explore the pleasures of books and reading by giving them the opportunity to have a book of their own. 15 million book tokens are being distributed by schools and libraries across the country and can either be exchanged for a free book or used to get £1 off the price of a full price book at a participating bookshop.

Krystal Vittles, Suffolk Libraries development manager and children’s lead, said: “Research has shown that spending just ten minutes a day reading with a child has huge benefits. It’s a great way to increase their literacy but the act of sitting together and enjoying a story is also really important and also fun. We think it’s really important to remind everyone how many brilliant children’s books are out there for families to enjoy together.”
