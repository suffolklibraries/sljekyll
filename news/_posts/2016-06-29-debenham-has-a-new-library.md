Suffolk’s newest library has opened in Debenham.

The village’s library has relocated to its new home at Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School.

The old library building in Cross Street was Suffolk’s smallest library but the new library provides a larger, more modern and more flexible space. The new library has new furniture including wheeled shelving to make holding activities easier and being located at the school will make it easier for school pupils to engage with the library. The new library has opened in time for the Summer Reading Challenge and pupils from the primary school have already visited. Although based at the school, the library is open to everyone and retains the same opening hours as the old library.

The project has involved Suffolk Libraries, the Debenham Library Foundation, Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School, Suffolk County Council, Sir Robert Hitcham Foundation Trust, Mid Suffolk District Council and Debenham Parish Council working in partnership and has also had the support of Aspall Cyder and many local people who have helped to raise funds for the move.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries said:

>I’m delighted that people in Debenham and surrounding villages now have access to a larger library with more space and flexibility for events and activities. As with all such projects, it has come about through various organisations working together to provide something that everyone in the community can benefit from.

Andrew Grant-Adamson, Chair of the Debenham Library Foundation, said:

>We’re all very excited about the new library. Support from the whole community has been outstanding with many individuals and organisations working to make this move happen. The idea of the library at the centre of the community is close to becoming a reality with various organisations thinking about how they will be able to use the larger library for a wide range of activities.
