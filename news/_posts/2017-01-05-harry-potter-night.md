All aboard the Hogwarts Express! For Harry Potter Book Night on Thursday 2 February, we're recreating the wizarding world in some of our libraries. These events were really popular last year, as you can see from [<cite>The Ipswich Star</cite>'s gallery of photos from Felixstowe and Ipswich's 2016 Harry Potter Book Nights](http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ipswich_events_announced_for_this_year_s_harry_potter_night_1_4837271) so we recommend you book early to avoid disappointment.

So far, five libraries have announced that they are holding Harry Potter-themed events:

* [Felixstowe Library's event](/events/felixstowe-2017-02-02-harry-potter-night/) not only promises 'storytelling and magical activities' but also the chance to meet characters from the books and shop at Flourish and Blotts.

* [Ipswich County Library's event](/events/ipswich-2017-02-02-harry-potter/) offers a potions class, fantastic beast-hunting, spellcasting battles, a quiz and a fancy dress competition.

* [Newmarket Library's event](/events/newmarket-2017-02-02-harry-potter/) invites young witches and wizards to join in the magical fun and games while dressed as their favourite Harry Potter characters.

* [Southwold Library's event](/events/southwold-2017-02-02-harry-potter/) offers inter-house competitions (once the Sorting Hat ceremony has taken place!) as well as crafts and games. There's also a prize for the person with the best costume.

* [Sudbury Library's event](/events/sudbury-2017-02-02-harry-potter-night/) will feature Platform 9Â¾, a Sorting Hat ceremony, crafts, games and refreshments.
