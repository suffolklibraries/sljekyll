Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Libraries are asking people their opinions of the Suffolk Libraries Local sessions which have been running in [Shotley](/libraries/shotley/), [Red Lodge](/libraries/red-lodge/) and [Moreton Hall](/libraries/moreton-hall/) over the past five months.

The ‘pop-up’ library sessions have been running as part of a pilot project to deliver a library service to communities without access to a static library building. They have delivered a range of weekly activities and other services as well as books. The project was funded by Suffolk County Council.

If you went along to a Suffolk Libraries Local session we’d love to hear your views. Please visit the [Suffolk Libraries Local page](/local/) to take part in a short survey about your experience. The survey closes on 24 September.

Paper copies of the survey are also available from the Suffolk Libraries Local sessions. These will be taking place until the end of October, when the extended pilot period ends.
