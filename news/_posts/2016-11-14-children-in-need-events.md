This year's BBC Children in Need fundraising extravaganza takes place on Friday 18 November, and we're marking it with events at some of our libraries.

**Lowestoft** and **Ipswich County** libraries are fundraising with events for young children and their carers. Lowestoft are holding a [special family play session on Friday 18 November](/events/lowestoft-2016-11-18-pudsey-family-play/) as well as a [Pudsey-themed craft session on Saturday 19 November](/events/lowestoft-2016-11-19-pudsey-craft/). At the family play session, 0-4 year-olds can have their faces painted and meet the Bookstart bear, while the craft session is aimed at older children.

Ipswich are holding a [special Play, Rhyme and Story Time session on Friday 18 November](/events/ipswich-2016-11-18-children-in-need/). Young children are invited to bring their teddies to the library, Jump for Pudsey, and enjoy a small picnic. They can also pick up their copy of the free stickerbook <cite>Bear's Reading Adventure</cite> at the session.

**Gainsborough Library's** teenage members are leading their fundraising for Children in Need. There will be a [Teenz Takeover of the Library on Sunday 20 November](/events/gainsborough-2016-11-20-teenz-takeover/) building on the success of previous occasions when the teenagers have run the library and caf√© for the day. They have promised there will be crafts, pool, Xbox, table tennis, table football, cakes, a tombola, face painting and more. Gainborough Library's Girls' Group will be raising further funds with a [flash mob in Ipswich town centre on Sunday 19 November](/events/gainsborough-2016-11-19-flash-mob/), in the area around the library and Reynolds Road shops.
