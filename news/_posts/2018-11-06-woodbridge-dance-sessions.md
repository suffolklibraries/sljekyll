11-25 year-olds who are interested in developing a creative performance are invited to a series of free fun and creative dance workshops with experienced dance artist Lynnette King this November and December.

Over the summer, we have been working with a number of local artists from Suffolk developing projects inspired by the communities and the people who live in them as part of our [BLOC youth arts programme](/bloc/). As part of this, Lynnette has been working closely with Woodbridge Library since the [Culture LAB week in July](/bloc/artists/culture-lab/) and with her support we will be launching the Promenade performance project, which will culminate in a vibrant public performance in spring 2019.

The workshops will take place on Wednesdays [14 November](/events/woodbridge-2018-11-14-dance-taster/), [28 November](/events/woodbridge-2018-11-28-dance-taster/), [12 December](/events/woodbridge-2018-12-12-dance-session/) and [19 December](/events/woodbridge-2018-12-19-dance-session/). All abilities are welcome and refreshments will be provided. You can [sign up online](https://artslibraries.typeform.com/to/Qcc42t) for as many or as few of the sessions as you like.

Melissa Matthews, Suffolk Libraries arts programmes coordinator, said: "We are incredibly excited to have Lynnette King running sessions as part of the BLOC creative programme in Woodbridge. This project is in response to the demands of the young people living in Woodbridge through conversations we had in the summer of this year.

"Not only is dancing is a wonderful tool for helping to reduce stress and anxiety, but it also helps us feel more connected with others and it is scientifically proven to improve our mood and mental health."
