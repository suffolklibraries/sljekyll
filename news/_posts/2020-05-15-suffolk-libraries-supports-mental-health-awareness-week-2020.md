Suffolk Libraries is backing Mental Health Awareness Week 2020 which runs from 18-24 May and has the theme of kindness. 

With life very different for everyone at the moment, we're encouraging people to share their stories about kindness and being kind. 

The act of being kind, either to ourselves or other people has great benefits for our mental health, including boosting confidence and reducing stress, and helping us feel more connected and less isolated.  

The Mental Health Foundation are asking people to share the following three things:   

* Reflect on an act of kindness. Share your stories and pictures (with permission) of kindness during the week on social media using #KindnessMatters and #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek.
* Join others in practising acts of kindness to yourself and others during the week.
* Share your ideas on how you think we could build a kinder society that would support our mental health using #KindnessMatters and #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek 

Our Wellbeing Manager, Sarah Lungley, has kickstarted the campaign with a video sharing a little about what she plans for the week.

Sarah commented:

"At a time like this, being kind is so important to help us maintain a feeling of connection to our loved ones and communities, and to help our own mental wellbeing. Mental Health Awareness Week gives us a great opportunity to share some of the wonderful acts of kindness happening, as well as giving us the perfect reason to take some time out and be kind to ourselves.‚Äù 

If you want to get involved, feel free to share your story with us using words, pictures or perhaps video and tell us what you will be up to.  

Suffolk Libraries will be sharing helpful resources and information throughout the week too.  For more information about the campaign and how to get involved, visit the [Mental Health Awareness Week website](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week).
