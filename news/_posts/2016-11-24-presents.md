Come in from the cold and enjoy some sensational stage shows this festive season with our programme of <em>Presents</em> screenings.

We have no fewer than four showings of New York City Ballet's production of Tchaikovky's iconic seasonal ballet <cite>The Nutcracker</cite> across our libraries in December, at [Newmarket Library on Monday 5 December](/events/newmarket-2016-12-05-presents-the-nutcracker/) [Felixstowe Library on Friday 9 December](/events/felixstowe-2016-12-09-new-york-city-ballet/), [Lowestoft Library on Friday 16 December](/events/lowestoft-2016-12-16-nutcracker/) and [Gainsborough Community Library on Thursday 22 December](/events/gainsborough-2016-12-22-nutcracker/). Enjoy the classic tale of a magical world where mischievous mice besiege a battallion of toy soldiers and an onstage blizzard leads to an enchanted Land of Sweets. With awe-inspiring set pieces, ornate costumes and grand one-of-a-kind visual effects, you'll almost feel like you're actually there.

Another stage show particularly associated with this time of year is Shakespeare's play <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, which we are showing at [Ixworth on Sunday 18 December](/events/ixworth-2016-12-18-presents-twelfth-night/). This timeless comedy features misdirection, deception and cross-dressing. There is also an all-male cast - including Mark Rylance, Roger Lloyd Pack and Stephen Fry - as there would have been when the play was first performed in the 17th century.

We also have a couple of upcoming screenings of Matthew Bourne's magnificent staging of Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, at [Lowestoft Library on Friday 25 November](/events/lowestoft-2016-11-25-swan-lake/) and [Gainsborough Community Library on Saturday 26 November](/events/gainsborough-2016-11-22-swan-lake/). The longest running ballet in the West End and on Broadway, with more than 30 international theatre awards, this production features an all-male cast and breathtaking drama and intensity.

We also have a showing of Kenneth Branagh's <cite>The Entertainer</cite> at [Hadleigh Library on Wednesday 30 November](/events/hadleigh-2016-11-30-hadleigh-entertainer/). Branagh plays memorably sad, middle-aged fading music-hall star Archie Rice in a performance to rival that of Laurence Olivier in the original 1957 production. <cite>The Entertainer</cite> skilfully evokes themes of seedy glamour, post-war decline, public masks and private torment.
