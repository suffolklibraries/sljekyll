We’re partnering with local children's book publisher Imagine That to offer Suffolk children the chance to win a space at a special winter storybook writing workshop.

**[Enter the Winter Story competition &rarr;](/winterstory-entry/)**

The workshop will be led by publishing professionals from Imagine That in [Ipswich County Library's newly revamped Hub space](/libraries/hub/) on Saturday 7 December. Ten winners aged 7-11 can design and write their own winter-themed picture book and share their stories. Five additional winners will receive book bundles.

The competition aims to celebrate the key role libraries play in Suffolk communities and the growing partnership between the two organisations. The workshop aims to capture children's imaginations and introduce them to the creative world of writing and designing books in the light of [recent findings about our libraries' positive impact on children's literacy development](/news/impact-report-published/).

David Henderson, MD of Imagine That Publishing, said: "Having admired the valuable work that Suffolk Libraries does in raising the profile of reading, we are delighted to be partnering with them on this special event.

"As a children’s publisher, we recognise the responsibility that we have to instil a love of books amongst our younger audiences. To be able to share our expertise in line with the community-focused efforts of libraries is a really important initiative for us"

Bruce Leeke, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: "I’d like to thank Imagine That for their support for our Suffolk Libraries Day activities recently. We’re really excited about working with them to offer this wonderful prize to some lucky local children and maybe we might inspire the next generation of authors."

To enter, all you need to do is enter your child's details into our [online form](/winterstory-entry/) by **Friday 22 November**. Winners will be announced shortly after this date. We will only use your information to enter you into the competition and contact you if you're a winner, and won't pass your details on to anyone else.
