We would like to find out more about how the library service can help improve the mental and emotional wellbeing of young people in Suffolk.

We are encouraging anyone aged 11-24 years to have their say by taking part in a [short online survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SLYPwellbeing).

Our New Chapters service helps to provide information on local services and promotes events in libraries and the community that can support mental health and wellbeing. The service also ensures library staff are able to access useful and up-to-date information for our customers should they request it.

Our [books on prescription list](/health/lists/health-lists/books-on-prescription-self-help-reading/) includes a number of mental health related titles available from libraries. The [health lists section](/health/lists/) on our website also features specially-curated books designed to boost children and young people's mental wellbeing.
