Haverhill Library are running an informal session aimed at 7-11 year olds who are reluctant readers or who have little confidence when reading.

The next Chatterbooks session is running this Saturday (28 May) from 10.30am to 11.30am at the library. It’s free and will involve a fun and informal session exploring the world of books but which is full of games and activities designed to encourage reading for pleasure.

The Chatterbooks sessions are part of a pilot project running on the last Saturday of the month for four months and if successful will lead to a more permanent session in the library.

Please contact [Haverhill Library](/libraries/haverhill-library/) for more information.

**Reviews of Chatterbooks:**

Mrs Vincent, Deputy Headteacher from The Glade Primary, Brandon:

>We did our library visit last week and the children were so excited. We have been very impressed with the project so far and have a very long waiting list of children waiting to join the next round of Chatterbooks. I have noticed some particularly shy and withdrawn children becoming animated, confident and giggly which has been wonderful to watch!

Sarah Hodge, Librarian from Hillside Primary, Ipswich:

>I wish every day was Monday then I could go to Bookgroup every day!

Mrs Lee, Teacher from Combs Ford Primary, Stowmarket:

>Chatterbooks is so much fun. The kids cheer when I go and collect them and others have asked to join the group! Parents have even stopped other members of staff to say how much their kids talk about what we do at home! Parents have even put on the parental questionnaire that the kids favourite thing a school is chatter books! Our scrap book is coming on nicely and kids are doing extra "tasks" at home for it.

From our libraries already running Chatterbooks sessions:

>The children were quiet on the first session and some were nervous. By the fourth session they were all talking about books they had read the previous week, taking part in the activities and were really excited about borrowing new books.

>The children are really enjoying Chatterbooks and the staff are too! The main problem we have is that we run out time at the end of the sessions!
