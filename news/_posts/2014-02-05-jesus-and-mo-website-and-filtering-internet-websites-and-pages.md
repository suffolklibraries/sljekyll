Recently a customer complained they couldn&#8217;t access the [Jesus and Mo website](http://www.jesusandmo.net/) from one of our public PCs. Several people also contacted us on Twitter.

We never made a conscious decision to block the website. Originally, we thought our internet filtering system may have been blocking the site automatically, but after testing we found **we could access the site from public PCs**.

It transpires **the site has been blocked from 4 PCs in Ipswich County Library**, where we are testing a new filtering system. We need to test this system with real users, so we can&#8217;t guarantee that certain sites won&#8217;t be blocked if you happen to use one of these PCs. We will leave a note on these 4 PCs so users understand why they can&#8217;t access certain sites.

Naturally, there are certain sites which are illegal or inappropriate to view in a public place because of their adult content, but we respect people&#8217;s right to free speech, and their freedom to view whatever content they wish on our public computers.
