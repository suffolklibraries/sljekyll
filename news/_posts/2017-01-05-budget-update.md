As you may remember, in November 2016 Suffolk County Council published its budget proposals which included a further reduction in the library budget for 2017/16. At the moment there is nothing further to report but discussions with the council have continued and it will again be discussing its budget at meetings over the next month, so we hope to be able to update customers further in the near future.

You may have also seen a [recent news story about outstanding overdue charges](http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/library_users_urged_to_support_suffolk_libraries_by_paying_their_fines_and_returning_overdue_books_1_4835104 ). While these charges are in place primarily to encourage people to bring back items so that others can borrow them, and money raised through charges goes back into the library service, it is important that people are not put off using the library service by outstanding charges.

We have no plans to actively chase customers regarding significant outstanding charges as this would not be cost effective. However, if you have any charges on your library account, we are always happy to discuss any concerns you have about managing them. If you are unable to get to a library, we are able to take credit or debit card payments over the phone. Please call customer services on **[01473 351249](tel:01473351249)** or email us at **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.
