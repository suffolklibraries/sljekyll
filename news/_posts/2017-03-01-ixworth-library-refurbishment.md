Ixworth Library will be closed from 10 to 24 April to enable refurbishment work to take place.

The work will improve the library for the benefit of local people with the refurbishment of the public area, including extensive painting and redecoration. The furniture and some shelving will also be replaced and the end result will be a fresher and more modern and library space.

The work has been paid for by funds raised by the [Friends of Ixworth Library](/about/member-organisations/friends-of-ixworth-library-foil/), locality funding from county councillor Joanna Spicer and money raised by Ixworth Libraryâ€™s art group.

We apologise to customers for any inconvenience during the closure. The nearest alternative libraries are at [Thurston](/libraries/thurston-library/) and [Elmswell](/libraries/elmswell-library/) and any library loans due back during the closure will have their return dates automatically extended.
