In April 2017, we joined up with Suffolk Family Carers and Suffolk Mind to create a new mental health service, IAGES (Information, Advice, Guidance and Emotional Support). We've been working very hard since then and we'd like to show you what we've been up to so far.

The partnership has been funded by the Mental Health Pooled Fund from Suffolk's Clinical Commissioning Groups and Suffolk County Council for the next few years to provide information, advice, guidance and emotional support to people living in Suffolk.

While each partner is responsible for delivering its own core part of the service, we are dedicated to working together to make information and support more visible and accessible, and help people better understand their wellbeing. We are working with many other organisations to achieve this aim.

During our six-month implementation phase, we have been:
* Raising awareness of the new partnership and its aims
* Gathering feedback from service users, staff and anyone interested in wellbeing to help shape the new service
* Developing, improving and gathering feedback about our existing services
* Establishing our next steps.

For further information about our implementation phase, see our [Implementation Phase Summary](/assets/pdf/iages-implementation-summary.pdf) (PDF).

We will be producing a more detailed evaluation report in the near future. If you have any questions in the meantime , email **sarah.lungley@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
