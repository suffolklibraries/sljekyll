[Lowestoft Library](/libraries/lowestoft-library/) now has a striking new yellow bin to enable people to donate unwanted books. The new ‘Book Bin’ was the idea of the Lowestoft Library Friends group and was kindly donated by the people at [wheeliebins.com](http://wheeliebins.com).

All the books collected will be sold on to raise additional funds to support the library. It’s a very big bin so there’s plenty of room if you’d like to pop in and drop some off.
