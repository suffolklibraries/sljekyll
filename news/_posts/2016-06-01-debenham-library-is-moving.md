Suffolk's smallest library is moving to bigger premises next month.

Debenham Library is moving from its current home in the resource centre in Cross Green to take up a larger space within Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School.

The current library building will be closing after Sunday 19 June with a new larger and more modern library reopening in its new location on Tuesday 28 June. The new library will have wheeled shelving to make holding activities easier and being located at the school will make it easier for school pupils to engage with the library.

As there will be a period when normal library services are unavailable due to the move, Suffolk Libraries is advising local people of the interim arrangements. Customers can use their library cards at any other Suffolk Library (the nearest are Stradbroke and Eye).

People can also use the Suffolk Libraries website at [www.suffolklibraries.co.uk](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk) to renew books or reserve them and there is a free eBook and eMagazine download service. Any library loans due back during the closure will also have their return date automatically amended until after the new library opens.

Suffolk Libraries apologises for any inconvenience during the closure but the move will provide a larger and improved library facility in the village. The project has involved Suffolk Libraries, the Debenham Library Foundation, Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School, Suffolk County Council, Sir Robert Hitcham Foundation Trust, Mid Suffolk District Council and Debenham Parish Council working in partnership and has also had the support of Aspall Cyder and many local people who have helped to raise funds for the move.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries said,

>I’m delighted that people in Debenham and surrounding villages will now have access to a larger library with more space and flexibility for events and activities. As with all such projects, it has come about through various organisations working together to provide something that everyone in the community can benefit from.

Maureen John, Debenham Library Manager, said:

>The staff at Debenham library are all looking forward to moving into the new library at the primary school. It is a brilliant space for a community library and we can't wait to be there!

Andrew Grant-Adamson, Chair of the Debenham Library Foundation, said:

>We’re all very excited about the new library. Support from the whole community has been outstanding with many individuals and organisations working to make this move happen. The idea of the library at the centre of the community is close to becoming a reality with various organisations thinking about how they will be able to use the larger library for a wide range of activities. As we approach the dream becoming reality, there is a buzz of and excitement about the opening.
