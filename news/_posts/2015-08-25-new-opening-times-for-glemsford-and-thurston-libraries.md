The library will be open the same number of hours but is now open on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Customers at both libraries have been consulted on all these changes which are designed to meet local demand and increase use of the library. The changes have been approved by Suffolk Librariesâ€™ Board and Suffolk County Council.
