Bury St Edmunds Library is holding a special summer fundraising event next month to give people a chance to enjoy some of the best local arts whilst experiencing the library in a different way.

A Summer’s Evening at Bury Library takes place on Saturday 8 August from 7.30pm and offers a taste of local art, music and theatre.

The event will feature the Bury St Edmunds Theatre workshop showcasing an extract from their Romeo and Juliet production. Local acoustic singer/songwriter Fern Teather will also be performing and there will be an exhibition of the work of the East Anglian Watercolourists.

There will also be a performance by a duo of operatic voices and the event is being supported by a number of Suffolk food companies who will be providing a sample of fine Suffolk fare. Tickets are £10 per person and can be bought from the library on 01284 732255.

The event is being held to raise money to improve the library environment with some new furniture for customers.

Neil Holmes, Manager of Bury Library, said:

>We wanted to look at how we could use the library space in new and exciting ways. Part of the fun of the evening will be showcasing what Bury Library can offer and showing customers what it’s like to experience different events and entertainment in the traditional library space they may use during the day. We are also aiming to raise funds to further improve the library environment.

The event is being supported by Bury Theatre Workshop, Casa Del Mar, Rodwell Farm Dairy, Butterworths, Fen Farm Dairy, Emmett’s, Suffolk Farmhouse Cheeses, The Bury Chocolate Shop, The Apex, Abbeygate Cinema, The Handmade Shop and the Society of East Anglian Watercolourists.
