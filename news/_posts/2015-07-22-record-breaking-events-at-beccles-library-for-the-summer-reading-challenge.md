Beccles Library is holding two Record Breaking Challenge afternoon events as part of this year’s Summer Reading Challenge.

The events are open to any children taking part in this year’s Summer Reading Challenge and offer a chance to have a go at some of the crazy, impressive and sometimes just silly activities that have made it into the Guinness Book of Records.

The events take place on Tuesday 28 July and Tuesday 25 August from 2pm and 3pm. They are free to all children who have signed up to take part in the Summer Reading Challenge.

Some of the wacky activities might include trying to sort as many jelly beans as possible with chopsticks, seeing how many socks you can get on one foot and making a paper version of the largest spider in the world!

The Summer Reading Challenge is a major literacy campaign organised by The Reading Agency and run in libraries. The aim is to encourage children keep reading throughout the summer holidays to maintain their reading skills and it’s also a great way of introducing them to their local library.

This year the theme is ‘Record Breakers’ with a series of collectable incentives and rewards for children and a challenge to read six library books during the holidays. There’s still plenty of time for children to sign up at the library.
