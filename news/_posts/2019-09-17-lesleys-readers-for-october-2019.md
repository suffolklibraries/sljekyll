Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>A Modern Family</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2569386), by Helga Flatland:

> "When Liv, Ellen and Håkon, along with their partners and children, arrive in Rome to celebrate their father's seventieth birthday, a quiet earthquake occurs: their parents have decided to divorce. Shocked and disbelieving, the siblings try to come to terms with their parents' decision as it echoes through the homes they have built for themselves, and forces them to reconstruct the shared narrative of their childhood and family history."
