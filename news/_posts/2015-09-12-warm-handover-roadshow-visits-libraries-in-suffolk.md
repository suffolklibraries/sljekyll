Several libraries in Suffolk will be hosting more Warm Handover Roadshows from next week.

The roadshows have been arranged to raise awareness of the ‘warm handover’ process. Various local organisations will be on hand to provide information and advice and two of the roadshows will also involve the Suffolk Family Carers Bus.

Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk Family Carers are both part of the Suffolk Information Partnership where local statutory and voluntary organisations have pledged to work more closely together to help customers looking for information or support.

If someone from one of the partnership organisations thinks a customer would benefit from help and support from one or more of the other organisations they can refer them on, with their permission. The idea is to help prevent people in need of support or advice having to repeat their story to lots of people and to help them access services they might not be aware of.

Anyone is welcome to come along to any of the libraries taking part to find out more. The details of the events is as follows:

Thursday 17 September (these two events include the Suffolk Family Carers bus):

  * 2pm-3pm at Eye Library
  * 4pm-5pm at Elmswell Library

Friday 18 September

  * 10am-12pm at Felixstowe Library
  * 1.30pm-3.30pm at Ipswich County Library

Thursday 24 September

  * 9.30am-10.30am at Bury St Edmunds Library
  * 11.30am-12.30pm at Stowmarket Library
