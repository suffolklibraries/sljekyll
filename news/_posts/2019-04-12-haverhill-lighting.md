Haverhill Library will be closed on Monday 29 April and running a limited service from 30 April - 4 May while it installs new lighting.

The one-day closure will allow scaffolding to be erected without any risk to staff or customers.

Between Tuesday 30 April and Saturday 4 May, limited amounts of books, CDs and DVDs will be available to browse and borrow, but customers will still be able to pick up their reservations and return items.

The library's regular events and activities will not be running during this period, but the [<cite>We're Going on a Bear Hunt</cite> 30th birthday celebration on Saturday 4 May](/events/haverhill-2019-05-04-bear-hunt/) will still be going ahead as planned.
