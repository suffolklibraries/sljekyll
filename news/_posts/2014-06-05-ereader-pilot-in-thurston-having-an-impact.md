Following our recent launch of a pilot project to lend eReaders to library customers at [Thurston Library](/libraries/thurston-library), we&#8217;ve already had some great feedback from a customer.

Mr Self from Stowmarket heard about the eReaders and borrowed a NOOK with a Barbara Taylor-Bradford novel downloaded on it for his 91 year old mother. She has issues with her eyesight and was having problems holding heavier large print books. They have both been impressed and Mr Self thinks it will make a big difference to his mother’s life. He says:

>My mother found the eReader very easy to use and was quite impressed with it. It’s a good idea to be able to trial something like this before deciding to buy one.

Mrs Self was having difficulty holding heavier large print books which she previously read due to her eyesight problems. She also has arthritis but quickly mastered the eReader, using the large text option and the device is much lighter to hold and was impressed that the device remembers the last page read.

She said:

>Some of the large print books are quite heavy to hold and I have a bit of arthritis in my wrists. This is very easy to use and lighter to hold and it is so easy to switch the page over. I can’t knit or sew now or read the papers and now this has come along and I am really pleased with it. It’s so easy to put down and carry on as it remembers where you are in the book.

The Friends group are already considering the possibility of obtaining more eReaders to lend to people. For more details of Suffolk Libraries eBooks check out our [eLibrary](/elibrary/).
