<p>Are you looking for something to do during half-term? We've got children's events taking place across our libraries. You can also <a href="/news/suffolk-show/">see us at the Suffolk Show</a>, where we'll be providing library experiences including regular story time sessions and craft activities for children.</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Elmer Day celebrations</li>
    <li>Activities with children's authors and entertainers</li>
    <li>Visits from Beach Bonkers and Suffolk Wildlife Trust</li>
</ul>

<p>Our libraries will be closed for the Spring Bank Holiday on Monday 27 May.</p>
