A new weekly drop in session at Ipswich County Library is offering a chance to chat to other people and discuss ‘what it is to be well’.

The Open Space sessions will run every Wednesday afternoon from 1pm to 3pm and are being launched by a partnership of Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, Suffolk Libraries and Julian Support.

The Open Space sessions are open to anyone who’d like to come along to the library and take part in informal activities to provide feedback on what they need to stay well in their community. Free tea and coffee will be provided and people are welcome to bring their lunch.

For more information contact David Grimmer, Suffolk Libraries Mental Health and Wellbeing Co-ordinator on 01473 263819.
