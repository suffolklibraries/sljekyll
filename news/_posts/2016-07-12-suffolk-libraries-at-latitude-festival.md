Suffolk Libraries will be at the Latitude Festival in the [Kids Area](http://www.latitudefestival.com/stage/kids-who-love-draw-read-and-play-music#activity-36) this weekend.

We'll be setting up camp in two medieval tents and keeping bookworms busy all weekend, with a combination of activities and crafts inspired by Roald Dahl and this year's [Summer Reading Challenge](/events-activities/summer-reading-challenge) theme - the Big Friendly Read!

If you're visiting Latitude please come and see us! We'll have books to borrow and share, alongside song and rhyme sessions throughout the weekend, a sandpit, toys and musical instruments.

Come and add to the giant crocodile, make a woolly wig, get yourselves a pair of giant ears, make pompom peaches, mice or glass eyes and much, much more!
