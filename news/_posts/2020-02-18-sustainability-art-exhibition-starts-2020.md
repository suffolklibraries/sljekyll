Suffolk Libraries is hosting an art exhibition at [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/) in collaboration with Suffolk New College in response to the theme of sustainability.

The exhibition is the final project of students undertaking an art qualification at Suffolk New College. Students were given the theme of sustainability, which the students could interpret as they saw fit. They were free to use a variety of mediums to express the theme including visual art, film, sculpture, fashion and textile, film and audio.

The exhibition is a collaboration between Suffolk New College and Suffolk Libraries’ [BLOC - Building Libraries on Creativity’ arts programme](/bloc/) funded by Arts Council England.

Sally Garwood, Suffolk Libraries Creative Programmes Co-ordinator said:

“We are so excited to house new works created by art students from Suffolk New College. This theme works perfectly in a library setting because sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. We are constantly re-using books and other materials.”

“We are really passionate about showcasing regional talent and supporting developing young artists. We can’t wait to see what they've created!”

Helen Armstrong Bland, Art and Design Lecturer at Suffolk New College said:
“This is a great project to be involved in and we are grateful to the library and BLOC for giving our students this opportunity."

You can see some of the artworks around the library until Friday 21 February. The rest of the exhibition, on the top floor of the library, is open to the public on Wednesday 19 February from 12pm – 5pm and Friday 21 February from 12pm – 5pm.
