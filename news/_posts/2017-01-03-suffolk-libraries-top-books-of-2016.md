An article in the <cite>East Anglian Daily Times</cite> has revealed that crime and thriller novels and the books of Roald Dahl were particularly popular among library users in Suffolk last year.

All five of the most-borrowed physical books came from the crime and thriller shelves, with [<cite>Make Me</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2012902) by Lee Child coming top with 1,847 loans. This was closely followed by Paula Hawkins' [<cite>The Girl On The Train</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1956254), with 1,804 loans. [<cite>Even Dogs in the Wild</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1853163), by Ian Rankin, came third with 1,307 loans.

The five most-borrowed eBooks were more varied. Readers were likely inspired to download Jojo Moyes' [<cite>Me Before You</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=175047), John le Carr√©'s [<cite>The Night Manager</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1471110) and JK Rowling's [<cite>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1968749) by the film, TV series and stage show respectively. Also popular were [<cite>After You</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1810323), Moyes' sequel to <cite>Me Before You</cite>, and [<cite>The Secret to Not Drowning</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1821882), by Colette Snowden, which was part of the Brave New Reads programme organised by the Norwich Writers Centre, which we participated in.

Our Big Friendly Read summer reading challenge doubtless helped three Roald Dahl books - [<cite>The BFG</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1926608), [<cite>The Twits</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1342715) and [<cite>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1926603) - make the five most-borrowed children's books last year. Ever-popular, [<cite>The Gruffalo</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1332918), by Julia Donaldson, and [<cite>Where The Wild Things Are</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=216844), by Maurice Sendak, complete the list.
