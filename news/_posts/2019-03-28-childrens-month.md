This April will be the first ever [Suffolk Libraries Children’s Month](/childrens-month/) – a brand new campaign to encourage more children and families to use their local library. It will launch on International Children’s Book Day on Tuesday 2 April and run throughout the month.  

To help encourage greater use of libraries, we are also removing overdue charges for children’s books from Monday 1 April.

Children's Month will celebrate everything we have to offer children of all ages, promote our broad range of children’s activities and services and, of course, highlight our wonderful range of children’s books.    

The event will also highlight the [many activities and events taking place in the Easter holidays](/childrens-month/childrens-month-events/). We'll be revealing [our libraries' favourite children's books](/childrens-month/suffolk-libraries-favourite-childrens-books/) throughout the month and you can [nominate your favourite children’s book](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/childrens-month) for a chance to win an iPad - a great way to discover all of our [online services](/elibrary/)!

Local children’s author and illustrator James Mayhew, best known for the Ella Bella Ballerina’ books and his illustrations in [<cite>Gaspard the Fox</cite> by Zeb Soanes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2396720), has created a special Children’s Month logo for us. The new logo is based on the Mouse and Mole series of books by Joyce Dunbar, which are being republished in May. James will be helping to launch Children’s Month at [Bungay Library](/libraries/bungay-library/) next Tuesday (2 April) at 10:30am along with a group of children from the nearby Bungay Primary School.   

James said: "I wholeheartedly support this campaign. It's so important to remind us all how much libraries offer communities, and in particular, young families and children. Anything that encourages children to borrow books has to be a good thing!

"The books we read as children stay with us all our lives. There are so many wonderful stories and pictures to discover in a library, all for free."

Bruce Leeke, chief executive of Suffolk Libraries, said: "Our Children’s Month will showcase the huge amount on offer for children and families across our libraries and the positive impact they have on children’s lives.  

“We lend over a million children’s books every year and thousands of families come along to our activities but we are always keen to share the magic of the library experience with even more people. It’s so easy to [get a Suffolk Libraries card](/help/joining-the-library/) which is the best way to make the most of what’s on offer.  

"Reading really can be life-changing so we’ve decided to remove fines for overdue children’s books to inspire even more younger users to see what we have to offer."
