Suffolk Libraries’ Music and Drama library service has been praised for helping to pull together the music needed for the free concert in Christchurch Park this Saturday (11 June) which is being held to mark Her Majesty the Queen’s 90th birthday.

The Suffolk Philharmonic Orchestra turned to the service, which is based at Ipswich County Library, to help them find enough sheet music to provide the varied and comprehensive programme needed for such an occasion.

Duke Dobing of Suffolk Philharmonic Orchestra said:

>The unusual aspect of this concert was the number of pieces to be performed. A usual ‘classical’ orchestra concert generally comprises three or four pieces. However, for a celebratory open air large–scale concert like the one on Saturday, we were very keen to present a really exciting and varied programme of a large number of short popular classical works. We needed the sheet music for around 20 titles altogether – four of which we had already – and the Music and Drama Library did sterling work in sourcing most of the rest. They have access to a highly efficient national library network and using this – and their own ‘on the shelf’ resources – Helen and Coral at the library did a brilliant job and were able to give crucial help to the orchestra at a vital stage in the preparation for this concert. Which is going to be quite something!

[The Music and Drama Library](/music-and-drama/) is based at Ipswich County Library but can be accessed from across the county. It’s a subscription service for groups, orchestras, bands, repertory companies, dramatic societies, play reading circles or individuals.

The outdoor event is being promoted by Ipswich Borough Council and will feature popular classics performed by Orchestra and will end with a firework finale.
