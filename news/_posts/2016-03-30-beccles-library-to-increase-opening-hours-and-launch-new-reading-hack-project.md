Beccles Library will be increasing its opening hours next month thanks to additional funding from the Beccles Library Community Trust.

The library will be opening an additional four hours every Wednesday. It is currently open from 9.30am to 1pm and from Wednesday 6 April 2016 it will open until 5pm on Wednesdays.

The additional staffing cost of the extra hours is being funded by Beccles Library Community Trust, the library’s community group set up to support and develop the library. The Trust have signed a formal agreement with Suffolk Libraries to fund the additional hours for an initial two year period which will be reviewed towards the end of this period.

The current early closing on Wednesdays was originally designed to match the early closing of shops in the town but, as most local businesses are now open all day, there is a demand for the library to be open all day. Waveney District Council’s customer services team moved into the library around 18 months ago which has also increased visits to the library together with additional awareness and demand for its services. The change was approved by Suffolk Libraries’ Board late last year.

Tony Brown, Chairman of Beccles Library Community Trust, said: “We’re delighted to be able to support these extra hours which I hope many people in Beccles and surrounding villages will benefit from. Our group was formed to support and develop Beccles Library and we felt funding these extra hours from the money we’ve raised would be an ideal way to help the community.”

To make the most of the new hours, the library will be hosting a six-week reading programme for pupils of Beccles Free School on Wednesday afternoons. The ‘Reading Hack’ sessions will run from 13 April and will involve students taking part in a range of proactive reading-inspired activities involving themes such as technology, poetry and volunteering. The sessions will be part of the school’s enrichment afternoons and will involve a group of around 6-12 pupils.

**Note to editors:** There will be a photo opportunity on Wednesday 6 April when the new opening hours come into effect at 1pm. Hugh Taylor, the Mayor of Beccles and also a member of Beccles Library Community Trust will be helping to launch the extended opening hours along with Tony Brown and other members of the group and library staff, including new Library Manager Ellen McAteer who joined Suffolk Libraries in January.
