As a result of the latest advice from the Government we have decided to suspend all our regular or one-off events and activities with immediate effect.


We regret having to make this decision but we feel it’s in the best interest of our customers and staff.

Our libraries remain open for the moment as we await further guidance. It is likely that they will be closing at some point in the near future so customers may wish to visit and stock up on books as it may be some time before they reopen.  In these difficult times we will be doing all we can to help customers. 


As of 17 March we have suspended all charges for overdue books and extended reservation and return dates indefinitely so customers do not need to worry about renewing or returning items. People will still be able to call or email our customer service team with any enquiries during normal operating hours.


We had already decided to suspend the Home Library Service due to the high number of customers receiving this service being at risk. We have asked volunteers who run the home library service to maintain telephone contact with customers to help them feel less isolated. 


We’d encourage everyone to keep checking our website for [updates about the situation](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/coronavirus/) and we’ll still be promoting book recommendations, reviews and ideas online and on social media. 


## eLibrary services


We’d encourage everyone to explore our extensive [free eLibrary services](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/elibrary/) at this time and library staff or our customer service team can help advise you if you need help setting them up. 


There are around 60,000 items available including eBooks, eAudiobooks, magazines and newspapers. You can also stream music, films and documentaries. Check out our [eLibrary pages](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/elibrary/) for more information on how to access these services. All you need is your library number and PIN.
