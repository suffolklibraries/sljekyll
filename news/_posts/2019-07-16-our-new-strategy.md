Suffolk Libraries has a new strategy for the future. Bruce Leeke, CEO of Suffolk Libraries, said:

"It’s an exciting time for Suffolk Libraries. We want to change the way people across Suffolk see their libraries and for our services to have an even bigger impact on people’s lives.  We’ve put together a document which summarises this vision and we’d love everyone to read it.

"The way people use libraries has changed and we are seeing many more people coming in to enjoy a huge range of events or activities. Last year we held just over 14,000 events and activities with over 200,000 people attending them. This is a 10% increase on the previous year with the number of people coming to these activities going up by 29% over the last four years. The diversity of events has grown too; whether it’s coding, LEGO, Manga, gardening, bike maintenance, boxing, sewing, performance art or a live music gig, we really do have something for everyone.

"Our libraries offer a place to connect with people, a place to express yourself or a place just to be. We have a team of fantastic staff and an army of supportive community groups who have played a big role in our success so far. We’re also holding our very first [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) in October which will celebrate how we make life better for the people of Suffolk through the power of the library network."
