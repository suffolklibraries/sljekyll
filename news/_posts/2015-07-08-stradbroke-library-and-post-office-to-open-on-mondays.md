Following a consultation with customers, Stradbroke Library and Post Office is changing its opening hours from Monday 3 August.

The main change is that the library and Post Office will be opening on Monday afternoons to allow for an extra mail collection. The change is designed to benefit customers following the popularity of the Post Office which opened last October.

Suffolk Libraries and the Stradbroke Courthouse and Library Trust consulted customers on the changes which mean the library will be open the same number of hours overall, but open on a Monday afternoon instead of Sundays which is felt would be of more help to local people who use the library and post office. Opening hours on other days have also been amended.

The new opening hours will be as follows:

  * Monday &#8211; 2.00pm to 5.00pm (currently closed on Mondays)
  * Tuesday &#8211; 2.00pm to 5.00pm (currently open 2.30pm to 5pm and 5.30pm to 7.30pm)
  * Wednesday &#8211; Closed (no change)
  * Thursday &#8211; 9.00am to 1.00pm & 2.00pm to 5.00pm (currently 10am to 1pm and 2.30pm to 5pm)
  * Friday &#8211; 2.00pm to 5.00pm (currently 2.30pm to 5pm)
  * Saturday &#8211; 9.00am to 1.00pm (currently 10am to 12.30pm)
  * Sunday &#8211; Closed (currently open from 10am to 3pm)

The opening hours at Stradbroke have not been revised for some time and the success of the new post office has prompted an exercise to ensure that its opening times best meet the needs of customers. Customers were consulted on two different options and over 170 people responded to the survey.

The library and post office are based in Stradbroke Courthouse which is also now offering a newly refurbished café facility. The Courthouse Café provides an opportunity to meet friends on Thursday and Saturday mornings and offers coffee, tea and homemade snacks.

The new opening hours will be launched on Monday 3 August with the café opening from 2pm-5pm and offering a free homemade cake with every drink purchased. More events at the courthouse are being planned for the autumn.

Besides the usual library services, the new library and post office offers a wide range of postal services including cash withdrawals, foreign currency, banking and insurance services.
