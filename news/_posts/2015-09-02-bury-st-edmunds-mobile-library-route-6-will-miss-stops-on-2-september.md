The Bury St Edmunds mobile library will not be running today due to the vehicle currently being off the road.

This will affect the [Bury mobile route 6](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/community-services/mobile-libraries/bury-st-edmunds-mobile-library-route-6).Â We apologise for the inconvenience; anyone with any loans due back today affected by this will have their loan dates adjusted.
