The new Eye Library celebrated its ‘topping out’ ceremony last week, where representatives from Suffolk Libraries, Suffolk County Council and Design and Property Consultants Concertus came together to mark the occasion and take a look round the new library.

Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries, said: “We’re all very excited to see the new library taking shape in Eye. Once open, I’m sure this new and modern library facility will provide many benefits and opportunities for everyone in the local community.”

Cllr Robert Whiting, Suffolk County Council’s Deputy Cabinet Member for Property, said: “Now the main building work is complete, Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk County Council can move on with plans to fit out the new modern interior for Eye Library, which will offer space for library services, community activities, events and a meeting space for people to hire. We are really pleased with the building work, it has been designed in a style which is sympathetic with neighbouring buildings in Eye.”

David Garrard, Associate at Concertus Design &amp; Property Consultants Ltd, said “It is great to see the turnout for the topping out ceremony. There are many people involved in making this project happen, working in collaboration has been a real testament and so far it’s looking great.”

The new library is due to open early in 2019.
