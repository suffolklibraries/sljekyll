The Suffolk Family Carers bus will be visiting libraries in east Suffolk on Tuesday 4 August

The Warm Handover Roadshow is part of a series of events to raise awareness of the ‘warm handover’ process. Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk Family Carers are both part of the Suffolk Information Partnership where local statutory and voluntary organisations have pledged to work more closely together to help customers looking for information or support.

If someone from one of the partnership organisations thinks a customer would benefit from help and support from one or more of the other organisations they can refer them on, with their permission. The idea is to help prevent people in need of support or advice having to repeat their story to lots of people and to help them access services they might not be aware of.

Anyone is welcome to come along to any of the libraries taking part to find out more or just to have a look at the Suffolk Family Carer bus which was bought last year after a successful fundraising campaign with BBC Radio Suffolk. This is the fourth roadshow and the previous events have reached around 100 people.

The timetable for visits on Thursday 23 July is as follows:

  * Leiston Library – 1pm to 2pm (the bus will be parking at the Engineers Arms)
  * Saxmundham Library &#8211; 2.30pm to 3.30pm
  * Wickham Market Library – 4pm to 5pm

The Suffolk Information Partnership involves Age UK Suffolk, Alzheimer’s Society, Customer First, Orbit East Care and Repair, Sue Ryder, Papworth Trust, Suffolk Family Carers, Avenues East,  Suffolk Mind and Suffolk County Council’s adult social care.
