Suffolk Libraries is again supporting Brave New Reads - a unique reading programme taking place in libraries across Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. With author events, book clubs, writing workshops and quizzes, Brave New Reads helps people get more from their reading. It’s a different kind of book club – chosen by readers, for readers and features a list of six brilliant books.

Six of Suffolk’s libraries are taking part in Brave New Reads with displays promoting the books and a series of events over the next few months at Bury St Edmunds, Beccles, Elmswell, Haverhill, Ixworth and Woodbridge.

Chris Gribble, Chief Executive of Writers’ Centre Norwich says:

> We’re very excited about Brave New Reads 2016. The opportunity of working with libraries in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire allows us to reach thousands of the readers they work with all year round and to showcase exhilarating books and publishers that reflect the real creative diversity of our society and our love of stories.

The six Brave New Reads titles were chosen out of a longlist of more than 120 books by the Readers’ Circle; a community of over 100 readers from across East Anglia. The final six represent some of the best work in contemporary literature; and touch on important current issues: from domestic abuse to immigration. (See below for all book details.)

Benjamin Johncock, author of Brave New Reads pick The Last Pilot, says:

>I’m thrilled that The Last Pilot has been selected for Brave New Reads 2016, alongside what I know will be five more brilliant books. I know these other titles will be remarkable because they were chosen by readers from across the region who are passionate about fiction, and their process is rigorous; their commitment to literature deep.

Brave New Reads is coordinated by Writers’ Centre Norwich, in collaboration with the Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire Library Services and funded by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.
