Josh Mayhew from Ipswich Academy is the winner of Suffolk Libraries’ Book Mastermind competition 2019.

Josh triumphed over eight other students from across the county at the 24th annual Suffolk Libraries Book Mastermind event, which tests secondary school students on their knowledge of books and general knowledge. The event is sponsored by The Suffolk Book League.

Entrants from schools across the county competed in area finals to qualify for the final, which was held in Stratford St Andrew. To win the final, pupils from each school had to answer questions on their chosen book and then a series of general knowledge questions including a picture round. Fellow students and teachers also came along to cheer on the finalists.

William Lyall from Culford School came second and Jess Scott from Pakefield School came third. Other schools whose students made the final included King Edward VI, CEVC Upper School, St. Joseph's College, Claydon High School, Sir John Leman High School, Stowupland High School and Bungay High School.

Following the competition, everyone who came along enjoyed two inspiring talks by children’s authors Hayley Long and Lisa Thompson.

Lisa Thompson is a children’s novelist who lives in Suffolk. Her debut novel, [<cite>The Goldfish Boy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2081507), was a Waterstones Children’s Book of the Month and went on to become a bestseller. It was also nominated for the Carnegie Medal, The Branford Boase Award and the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize.

Hayley Long began is the author of the Lottie Biggs series. The first book in the series, [<cite>Lottie Biggs is Not Mad</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1614842) was awarded the White Raven label for outstanding children's literature by the International Youth Library. Her other books have also received accolades including the Mal Peet Children's Award.

Suffolk Libraries head of service delivery Krystal Vittles said: "Every year we’re amazed by the standard at Book Mastermind and at the students’ all-round knowledge and love of books. We’re very grateful to the Suffolk Book League for their support and to our two inspirational authors who may have inspired the next generation of authors."

Suffolk Book League chair Amanda Hodgkinson said: "It was an absolute joy to watch those children display their love of the books they had chosen and their obvious really close reading of them. The range of choices was exciting, from Percy Jackson to [<cite>Anne of Green Gables</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2123346), and the standard was really high. 

"It's a real pleasure to attend and I consider it one of the perks of being the chair of our organisation. The children who make up the audience have taken part in the earlier heats and are really supportive of their fellow students."
