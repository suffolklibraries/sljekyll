It has been confirmed this week that [Stradbroke Library](/branches/stradbroke-library/) will host a new Post Office &#8211; meaning that Suffolk Libraries may be one of the first library services in the country to run a post office.

The Post Office has this week announced that following a consultation period with local people, a new post office will reopen at the library after the previous facility closed around 18 months ago.

Alison Wheeler, General Manager of Suffolk Libraries, said:

>We believe that we might be the first library service in the country to be running a post office which is very exciting! Libraries can be a focal point for the community and it makes sense for us to offer other services where possible as it supports the running of the library whilst providing a vital service to local people which has previously been lost.

Post Office regional network manager Julia Marwood said:

>We understand how important post office services are to residents in Stradbroke and we are confident this new modern branch will meet the needs of the local community and secure services for the future.

The new post office will have the same opening hours as the library and will be open for 20 hours a week. The service will be monitored and it might be possible to extend or amend opening hours in the future depending on customer demand. There will be a clearly designated Post Office till point in the main library area and there will be some work carried out to accomodate the new facility in the library.

It is hoped the new post office will be open towards the end of the summer.
