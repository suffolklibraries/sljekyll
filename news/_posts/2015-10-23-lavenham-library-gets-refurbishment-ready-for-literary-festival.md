Lavenham Library will be undergoing refurbishment work next month ready for its involvement in Lavenham Literary Festival.

The library, based at Lavenham Village Hall, will remain open but refurbishment work will be ongoing from Tuesday 3 to Wednesday 11 November.

The library will remain open throughout the work but there will be restricted space available for customers during this period with no access to the children’s area and the library’s two PCs. The library’s two Google Chromebooks will still be available for use for anyone wanting to access the internet and the work is being carried out in a way which minimises the impact on customers as much as possible. Suffolk Libraries apologies for any inconvenience caused by the work.

The refurbished library will reopen fully in time to host Lavenham Literary Festival events on Friday 14 and Saturday 15 November. The library will be hosting book signings with Tom Holland, Toby Buchan, Rachel Joyce, Tracy Borman, Kate Mosse, Sheila Hancock and Andrew Lownie. The Friends of Lavenham Library will also be supporting events by providing refreshments throughout the Festival weekend.

Full details of the Lavenham Literary Festival can be found at [www.lavenhamliteraryfestival.co.uk](http://www.lavenhamliteraryfestival.co.uk).
