The first ever [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/), held on Saturday 12 October 2019, raised £16,400 and brought an extra 4,000 visitors to the county’s libraries.

The event was designed to raise funds to support the libraries and raise awareness of the huge role they play in Suffolk life. Every library held special fundraising events, preceded by a week-long [Book Journey](/suffolk-libraries-day/book-journey/) involving fantastic and imaginative support from local businesses, individuals and groups, who helped to transport a book 323 miles via all 44 libraries. The funds raised will be spent on services that impact communities all over the county.

Suffolk Libraries Chief Executive Bruce Leeke welcomed the news: "This is a superb achievement given that this was the first ever Suffolk Libraries Day and the first time we’ve actively promoted Suffolk Libraries as a fundraising charity.

"I’d like to thank all our staff who put so much time and energy into supporting the day. I’d also like to say a huge thanks to the many local businesses who put so much effort into supporting the Book Journey with wacky and wonderful ways of moving a book around the county. It’s great that so many people and organisations recognise the value of their local library and to see such large numbers getting involved too!

"It’s really important that we raise more income to support our services, but on top of this, it’s been a great opportunity to promote Suffolk Libraries and engage with even more local people."

We are currently planning for the next Suffolk Libraries Day, with the date likely to be announced in early 2020.
