From 9 - 23 July, you can borrow <cite>Cowboy Pride</cite> by Lacy Williams on OverDrive without a wait list and join in a worldwide discussion.

> “Everyone knows a rancher in possession of a large spread needs a wife.”

> "First impressions count. Liza Bennett has two missions in life: keep the family’s shop afloat, and ensure her shy sister finds love. Sparks fly when she meets rancher Rob Darcy at a town dance, but when she overhears him insult her, she vows to put the man out of her mind. Rob Darcy is instantly attracted to the vivacious Liza but a lack of social graces and the promise he’s keeping ruin his chances of winning her.

> "Once jilted, Janie Bennett is appropriately gun-shy of falling in love again. But she doesn’t seem to be able to help herself when she meets charming Nathan Bingley. Bingley desperately wants a wife and family of his own. Can he trust that Janie returns his feelings?

> "When Janie is injured in a spring storm, she and Liza are sequestered on Nathan’s ranch. Hearts and emotions get tangled, but will first impressions prove true, or false?

> "<cite>Cowboy Pride</cite> is a Wild West version of <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite> with dual love stories.
