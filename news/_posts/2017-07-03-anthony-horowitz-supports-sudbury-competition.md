One of the country’s most successful authors, Anthony Horowitz OBE, has agreed to support [Sudbury Library’s short story competition for children](/events/sudbury-2017-06-19-short-story-competition/) by writing an introduction to a book of the best entries.

Horowitz has written over 40 books including the bestselling Alex Rider teen spy series which is estimated to have sold 19 million copies worldwide. He was also commissioned to write two new Sherlock Holmes novels and more recently was also commissioned to write a new James Bond novel, [<cite>Trigger Mortis</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1819856). Anthony is also responsible for creating and writing some of the UK’s most beloved and successful television series, producing the first seven episodes of <cite>Midsomer Murders</cite> and creating the award-winning drama series <cite>Foyle’s War</cite>.

Sudbury Library and the Friends of Sudbury Library are organising the competition, which challenges children aged 6-13 to write a short story of up to 500 words. Local printing firm [Lavenham Press Ltd](http://www.lavenhampress.com/) is kindly supporting the competition by producing and printing 100 copies of a special book which will include the 50 best entries.

There are two competition categories: ages 6-9 and 10-13. Entry is £1 and two winners will receive copies of the book signed by Anthony Horowitz. The closing date is Saturday 2 September and copies of the compilation book will be available to buy from 4 November when there will also be a special presentation event for the winners of the competition.
