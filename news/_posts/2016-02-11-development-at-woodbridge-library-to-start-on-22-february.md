Work to develop and upgrade Suffolk Coastal District Council’s Customer Services presence in the library is due to start on Monday 22 February and should be complete by the end of March.

We want to reassure customers that library and council services will remain open and accessible throughout the work.

Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk Coastal are working together to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum but there may be some intermittent noise at various times during the work. We apologise for any inconvenience to customers.

Please talk to library staff if you have any questions or concerns about the work.
