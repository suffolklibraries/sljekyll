Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with
journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers Monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>The Geneva Trap</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=458644), by Stella Rimington:

> "Geneva, 2012. When a Russian intelligence officer approaches MI6 with vital information about the imminent cyber-sabotage of an Anglo-American defence programme, he refuses to talk to anyone but Liz Carlyle. But who is he, and what is his connection to the British agent?"

If you've read the book, why not join in the discussion at 2:30pm
