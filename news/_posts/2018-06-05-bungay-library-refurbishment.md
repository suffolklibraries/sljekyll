Bungay Library will be closed from Tuesday 10 - Wednesday 18 July for refurbishment and redecoration. It will reopen at the usual time of 9am on Thursday 19 July.

The work will include the installation of new windows and a door, new energy efficient LED lighting, a new carpet and new shelving, including a special book nook for the childrenâ€™s library.

The work is being paid for by a combination of Suffolk County Council, the [Friends of Bungay Community Library](/about/member-organisations/bungay-community-library/) and other sources.

We apologise for any inconvenience to customers caused by the closure. Customers can use any other Suffolk library, with [Beccles Library](/libraries/beccles-library/) being the closest. Any loans due back during the closure will have their return date extended.
