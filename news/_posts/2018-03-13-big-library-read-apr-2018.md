From 2 - 16 April, you can borrow <cite>Flat Broke with Two Goats</cite> by Jennifer McGaha on OverDrive without a wait list and join in a worldwide discussion.

In this autobiographical novel, Jennifer tells the story of how she and her husband moved their family to a rural cabin after foreclosing on their suburban home. Living with goats, chickens and opossums, their new life is a far cry from the one they're used to, and full of both challenges and joy.
