Visitors to Broomhill Library will have the opportunity to experience history with a brand new World War II exhibition as part of Heritage Open Days 2019.

The exhibition runs from Friday 13 - Sunday 22 September, during [the library's usual opening hours](/libraries/broomhill-library/). It will feature a special display of artefacts including gas masks and shrapnel that was discovered in the north-west area of Ipswich. The library will also be playing music from the 1940s as part of the experience.

Broomhill Library, formerly known as Westbourne library, started its life as a bomb shelter and decontamination unit during the Second World War. It was converted into a library in 1948 and renamed as Broomhill Library two years ago, in a decision to reflect the libraryâ€™s local area. The library is now a Grade II listed building.

Broomhill manager David Cook said: "We are proud to honour the heritage of the library and its significance in history. We will be offering refreshments to visitors whilst they can listen to some World War II music. There will also be several artefacts on display that we have borrowed from our friends at the Martlesham Heath Aviation Society."
