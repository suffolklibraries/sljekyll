Southwold Library will be getting a makeover this autumn with new wheeled shelving being installed in September. 

The new equipment is being funded by the Friends of Southwold Library and will allow the shelving to be moved to make a more flexible space for the many groups, events and activities that run at Southwold Library.

Whilst the work is taking place, the library will have to close on Sunday 18 September, reopening on Tuesday 20 September. The aim is to carry out the work after the end of the Summer Reading Challenge. 

The Friends of Southwold Library have raised the £9,000 required for the shelving from a variety of fundraising activities including book sales, quiz nights, plant sales, fetes, game stalls at local charity events, craft sales, sound and vision sales, coffee mornings, musical concerts and the annual Slaughter in Southwold Crime Writers Festival.

Charlotte Clark, Manager of Southwold Library, said: “We’re excited about these new shelves which will improve the look of the library and how it can be used. I’m delighted that the activities of the Friends and their hard work has allowed us to get this shelving which will make such a difference to our small space.”

Suffolk Libraries apologises to any customers for the inconvenience during the closure and is advising local people of the interim arrangements. 

Customers can use their library cards at any other Suffolk Library (the nearest are Halesworth and Kessingland).

People can also use the Suffolk Libraries website at www.suffolklibraries.co.uk to renew books or reserve them and there is a free eBook and eMagazine download service. Any library loans due back during the closure will have their return date automatically amended until after the library reopens.
