excerpt: Information for anyone who has bought Latitude tickets from Southwold Library.
---
Unfortunately we've been informed that this year's Latitude festival will [not be taking place](https://www.latitudefestival.com/news/latitude-festival-2020-no-longer-taking-place/) due to the current situation. 

Many people will have bought tickets from direct from Southwold Library and will have been told to contact the library about a refund.  

Unfortunately it is likely that the library will only be able to process refunds once it reopens and it's impossible to know when that might be at the moment. The library manager has requested that anyone who bought Latitude tickets from the library should email southwold.library@suffolklibraries.co.uk so their details can be logged. This will make processing refunds easier once the library reopens.
