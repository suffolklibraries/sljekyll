From 1 - 15 November, you can borrow <cite>Circe</cite> by Madeline Miller on OverDrive without a wait list and join in a UK-wide discussion.

> "In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft."

As with physical library books, OverDrive titles' availability is usually subject to demand from other users. By taking such restrictions off the eBook of <cite>Circe</cite> for two weeks, OverDrive have given readers at libraries across the UK the opportunity to borrow this book simultaneously, encouraging them to read and discuss it.

You can borrow <cite>Circe</cite>, find out more about the book and join the discussion from the [Suffolk Libraries OverDrive catalogue](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/) during this period. For help setting up OverDrive, please see [our OverDrive instructions page](/elibrary/overdrive/).
