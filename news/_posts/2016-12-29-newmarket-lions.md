The Newmarket Lions Club have kindly donated £1,000 to give Newmarket Library’s children’s area a fresh new look.

The funding will be used to fund some Storywall furniture for the children’s library. Storywall furniture is a fun, colourful and practical way to help improve the children’s library environment, providing shelving as well as storage areas for craft materials and equipment. It also has coloured dots which have both a decorative and functional purpose as they can help absorb the sound from children’s activities.

Chris Rawlinson, Newmarket Lions PR Officer, said, "We are delighted to be in a position to make this large donation and would encourage children if they have not visited for a while to come along and see what it has to offer them.

"We work extremely hard in the community to raise money and it was felt after seeing the fantastic improvements to the library recently and reading about the desire for the Storywall, that we should get in contact and donate the £1,000 we made from the firework display at Wildtracks to buy it to improve the facilities for the children in the town. This money will benefit hundreds of children and make their visit really enjoyable which would hopefully lead to their better education.

"Newmarket Lions are always looking for new members and if you would like to learn more about us or want to get involved with our fundraising just come along to one of our meetings at the Rutland Arms Hotel in Newmarket where we meet every first and third Thursday at 8pm. We guarantee a warm welcome."

Newmarket Lions is a very small club of people who raise money for local charities and causes. They raise money from holding various events throughout the year including race nights, street collections and Santa's grotto. Their most successful event this year was the re-established firework event.

An additional £145 has been raised via a crowdfunding webpage from Newmarket Tesco who have also contributed towards the project. The improvements to the children’s library come only a few months after the completion of a significant refurbishment project at the library which involved complete redecoration. Funding has also recently been secured to improve the library’s racing collection.
