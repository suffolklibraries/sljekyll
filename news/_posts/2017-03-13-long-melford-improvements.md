Long Melford Library is unveiling a new look this Wednesday (15 March). New furniture and carpets have recently been installed and the library has been redecorated.

The Friends of Long Melford Library and Suffolk Libraries are holding an event on Wednesday 15 March at 2pm to thank everyone who has contributed. The Yarnsmith of Norwich Dave Tonge will be at the library sharing his Tudor Tales with the library’s Top Time group and will be cutting the ribbon.

Funding for the furniture and carpets has come from Waitrose Sudbury’s green token community scheme, The Hamilton Charity and the Friends Of Long Melford Library. The Hamilton Charity is a local trust set up to improve amenities and services for the benefit of vulnerable individuals and organisations that support them in the Long Melford area.

The project has also been supported by local town and district councillor John Nunn, who helped the library to access funding from the Hamilton Charity. Local residents are welcome to come along and visit the library to see the improvements.
