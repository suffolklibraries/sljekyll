Beccles Library is teaming up with Hughes Electrical to provide a special Get Connected event on Tuesday 21 February to launch their new iPad lending scheme.

The event is free and will run from 10am to 3pm. Get Connected events are designed to provide people with advice on how to make the most of tablets, eReaders and smart phones.

The library will also be the latest in Suffolk to launch a scheme which will give customers the opportunity to borrow and test drive an iPad. The library has two iPad minis which people will be able to borrow for free for up to three weeks. The iPads have been funded by The Friends of Beccles Library.

The event is also a great opportunity for anyone to come along and get advice on how to make the most of their own device or on buying a new one. Itâ€™s also a great way to find out more about the wide range of online services available from Suffolk Libraries including eBooks, eMagazines, eAudio books and free music. Tech engineers from Hughes Electrical, as well as community group volunteers and library staff will be on hand during the event to provide information.
