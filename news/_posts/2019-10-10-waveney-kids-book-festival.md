Southwold and Beccles libraries will be hosting a variety of events and activities with the theme of books, writing and drawing for children of all ages this October half-term.

The programme includes Uncle Shawn and Bill author A. L. Kennedy, Football School author Spike Gerrell, and Gaspard the Fox author and illustrator Zeb Soanes and James Mayhew. Children can break codes with author and Suffolk librarian Sophie Green, learn a circus skill with author and Halesworth library staff member Francesca Armour-Chelu, and make a bow and arrow, Thor hammer, and dog coaster with Linda Davies, Kevin Crossley-Holland and Lisa Thompson respectively. There are also screenings of <cite>The Railway Children</cite> and book-based crafts and game sessions available to enjoy.

Southwold Library manager Charlotte Clark said: "We are so proud to be able to fulfil the dreams of our late Southwold Mayor Matthew Horwood and make this kids’ book festival a reality. It’s great to be able to expand what we can offer to children and families and encourage the readers, writers and illustrators of the future.

"Most of all this should be a week of fun and we hope lots of people will join us as we have something for everyone, young or old."
