A new residential development in Oulton Broad will provide a new library for local people.

Waveney District Council&#8217;s Planning Committee recently approved a planning application for the development on the former Oswald&#8217;s Boatyard site at the north-west of Lake Lothing.

The new development will also house a brand new Oulton Broad Library with the existing library being converted into housing.

The development will enable Suffolk Libraries to provide the local community with a more modern, attractive and vibrant library space to access our services. Although it won&#8217;t happen for some time, the move to the new library will take place before the current building is closed and we will work to ensure as little disruption to customers as possible.

There is more information on the development on [Waveney District Council&#8217;s website](http://www.waveney.gov.uk/site/scripts/news_article.php?newsID=928)
