[Wickham Market Library](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/wickham-market-library) are holding their Easter Eggstreme Reading Challenge again this year.

The reading challenge is open to any children aged under 12. The children have to collect a reading record card from the library and the aim is to read four books during the Easter period. Once they have completed all four books they are entered into a prize draw. There are lots of prizes and everyone turning up to the presentation on Sunday 10 April at 3pm will get given a small Lindt chocolate egg.

The reading record cards are available now. This is the third year Wickham Market Library has run the challenge and last year 50 children took part.
