Suffolk Libraries will be taking part in the [Suffolk Show](https://suffolkshow.co.uk/) for the first time this year, showcasing the range of library services and experiences available across the county on Wednesday 29 and Thursday 30 May.

You can find us at two separate tradestands: at the new Reflections Courtyard, and with West Suffolk College.

The Reflections Courtyard is a new area close to the centre of the showground where people can take time out from the show. Our staff will be providing a [Suffolk Libraries Local](/local/) pop-up library experience, with regular story time sessions and craft activities for children, a selection of books to browse and board games to enjoy. [Rural Coffee Caravan](https://www.facebook.com/RuralCoffeeCaravan/) will also be in the Courtyard, providing refreshments and information about their work.

You can also find out more about the huge range of activities, services and opportunities we provide across the county, and the impact we have on our communities. We'll also be asking you for your feedback and ideas and inviting you to enter a special Suffolk Libraries quiz for the chance to win one of 25 shopping vouchers.

Our Arts Council-funded youth arts programme [BLOC (Building Libraries on Creativity)](/bloc/) will be at West Suffolk College stand running a Virtual Reality arts activity and iPad drawing workshops. Our [New Chapters mental health and wellbeing information service](/health/) will also be on hand, providing information about how the library service can help connect people with resources or organisations to assist them with their wellbeing, including the [Pride and Periods period poverty scheme](/health-pride-and-periods/).

Suffolk Libraries head of digital and marketing Leon Paternoster said: "We are working hard to reach out to new people across the county and the Suffolk Show is an ideal opportunity to do this. Thanks to the Suffolk Show organisers and West Suffolk College, we’ll be able to showcase the wide range of library services and the important role that libraries play in Suffolk life.

"If anyone is visiting the show and wants to find out more about the work of Suffolk Libraries, please come along to the Reflections Courtyard and the West Suffolk College stand to find out more.”

The West Suffolk College stand is number 729 on Flower Show Avenue and the Reflections Zone is off the Main Avenue, near the Suffolk Show Office.
