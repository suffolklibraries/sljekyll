In what may be the first scheme of its kind in the country, Halesworth Library is launching a new iPad lending service to customers.

The new iPads will be available from Wednesday 22 July when the new service is launched at a special ‘Get Connected’ event at the library.

The event takes place from 10am to 1pm and will provide an opportunity for people to find out more about the iPad lending service and other online services available at the library.

The library will be lending four iPads to start with, which have been purchased with money raised by the Friends of Halesworth Library and thanks to a significant discount from the local Hughes store. Staff from Hughes will also be on hand during the event to offer advice on the range of products available from their stores. It’s thought to be one of, if not the first, schemes of its kind operating from a public library in the UK.

The iPad lending scheme offers people the chance to borrow an iPad for three weeks. It’s an ideal opportunity for anyone thinking of buying one and to showcase the range of apps available. It can also be a great way to explore the range of online services available from Suffolk Libraries such as eBooks and free weekly music downloads.

Halesworth Library is already running popular laptop and iPad sessions on Wednesday afternoons for people who need help with their devices.
