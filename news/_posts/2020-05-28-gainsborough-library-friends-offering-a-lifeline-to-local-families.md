A library friends group in Ipswich is providing a lifeline to local families by delivering weekly food and other supplies using funds previously raised in the library’s community cafe.

Voices 4 Gainsborough Community Library have delivered free boxes of fruit and vegetables to more than 75 people in 22 homes in the local area.  The group is now appealing for help to keep the scheme going.

The idea came from the library manager Mandy Grimwood and Sarah Woolven, the Chair of Voices 4 Gainsborough Library. They became aware that some of the families who use the library were struggling with schools closed and other family issues. The group have also delivered free sanitary items to some homes as part of Suffolk Libraries Pride & Periods project. 

Sarah Woolven, the Chair of Voices, said:

> “We’re delivering fruit and veg boxes for vulnerable families who use the library on a regular basis to help them out in this time of crisis. The response has been amazing and everyone who receives them are all very grateful and appreciate that we are doing this for them at this time. One parent said the kind gesture brought tears to their eyes.”

The group have worked with Nansen Road Church food bank who provided additional food parcels for families and are now working with FIND but any offers of help to continue to provide fruit and veg box deliveries would be very welcome. 

Voices 4 Gainsborough Library’s [localgiving page](https://localgiving.org/communityfruitvegboxes) is raising money for the project or anyone who can help can contact Mandy Grimwood via gainsborough.library@suffolklibraries.co.uk
