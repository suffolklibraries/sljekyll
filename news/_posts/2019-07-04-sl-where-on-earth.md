Where on EARTH are you? We're asking this question for our space-themed [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/), which starts on Saturday 20 July.

The campaign, using the hashtag **#SLWhereOnEarth**, encourages social media users to post their selfies of themselves reading books over the summer, no matter where they are in the world.

Leon Paternoster, head of digital & marketing for Suffolk Libraries, said: "You can read anything, anywhere for the Summer Reading Challenge, including eBooks and eAudio, no matter where you are in Suffolk - or the world!

"For parents and carers, #SLWhatOnEarth gives children something fun to do over the long break, while keeping up their reading levels. They can also pick up or download a book themselves from the library or our website.‚Äù

This social media campaign is inspired by our annual Summer Reading Challenge, for which the theme this year is Space Chase, inspired by the 50th anniversary of the first moon landings.
