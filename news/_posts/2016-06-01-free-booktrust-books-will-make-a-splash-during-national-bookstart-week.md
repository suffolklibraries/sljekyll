Suffolk Libraries will be celebrating National Bookstart Week next week with events aimed at young children and free books to give away.

Bookstart week runs from Monday 6 to 12 June and this year’s theme is ‘Under the Sea’ with reading charity BookTrust supported by Barefoot Books, providing 450,000 free copies of the children’s picture book <cite>A Hole in the Bottom of the Sea</cite> by Jessica Law and illustrated by Jill McDonald to give away across the country.

National Bookstart Week is an annual celebration of BookTrust’s flagship reading programme, Bookstart, which gives every child in England and Wales a free reading pack in the first year of their life and again when they are 3-4 years old. The ethos of the charity is to remind families of the importance of reading for fun – even if it’s just for ten minutes a day.

Almost every library in Suffolk has at least one Bookstart session and they are a perfect way to introduce very young children to books with stories, songs and rhymes that are enjoyed by thousands of families across the county. There were over 62,000 attendances by children and their families to regular activities for under 4s in the county’s libraries last year.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:

>Our activities for children and families are one of the most important and cherished things we provide the community. Getting children engaged with the library and enjoying books with their families at an early age is so important and we want to encourage families to read and celebrate books together from birth.

From Monday 6 – Sunday 12 June there will be thousands of free events around the country for babies, toddlers, pre-schoolers and their families, at libraries, children centres, nurseries and bookshops. Events will include stories, rhymes and lots of fun undersea activities to inspire families to read together and everyone attending a special Bookstart Week event or a regular Bookstart event will have a chance to pick up one of 2,000 free copies of ‘A hole at the bottom of the sea’ which Suffolk Libraries have been allocated.

Diana Gerald, Chief Executive of BookTrust said:

>Making time to read with your children is so important because shared reading leads to a love of reading. And we know that reading for pleasure has a dramatic impact on life outcomes – and this is as much about confidence and well-being as it is about educational achievements.

>Children who are read to every night start school a year ahead of those who are not and the gap only widens as they get older. Quite simply, children who read for pleasure are happier, healthier and do better in life than those who don't.

The following special events are taking place at the county’s libraries next week:

* Chantry Library are holding an ‘Under the Sea’ story time special on Saturday 11 June from 2pm to 4pm, with games, crafts, activities and refreshments.
* Wickham Market Library will be holding an 'Under the Sea Storytime' session on Tuesday 7 June from 11am to 11.30am.
* Aldeburgh Library will be having an 'Under the Sea' themed music session on Monday 6 June from 10.30am-11am.
* Gainsborough Community Library in Ipswich will be holding a story time session on Tuesday 7 June from 10.30am to 12noon with under the sea stories, games, activities and refreshments.

If families are unable to make it along to their local event they can join in the fun at home, with plenty of undersea-themed arts and crafts and games, all on the Bookstart website: [www.bookstart.org.uk](http://www.bookstart.org.uk).

BookTrust have also just launched their new campaign ‘[Bath, Book, Bed](http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/bath-book-bed)’, which promotes a regular routine involving a bedtime story to help parents of babies and toddlers get them off to sleep - any parents wanting to adopt this advice and obtain children’s books from the library can sign themselves or their children up to the library service for free as soon as their baby is born.
