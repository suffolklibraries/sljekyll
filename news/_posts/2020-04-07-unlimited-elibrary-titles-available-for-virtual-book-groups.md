Suffolk Libraries is promoting its collections of unlimited use eBooks which would be ideal for anyone thinking of setting up virtual book groups.

Most library eBooks work like physical books in that individual copies can only be borrowed one at a time. Suffolk Libraries now has two new collections of 25 eBook titles with unlimited copies available for loan via the Overdrive service.

This means they can be borrowed by anyone with no waiting times and are ideal for book groups.

There is a collection for [adults](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/1056885) and one for [children and young adults](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/1059853). 

The adult collection includes a Tale for the Time being by Ruth Ozeki, How not to Be a Boy by Robert Webb, and Life of Pi by Yann Martel. The collection for younger readers includes The House with Chicken Legs by Sophie Anderson, A Dog’s Life by Ann M Martin and It Only Happens in the Movies by Holly Bourne. 

[Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/elibrary/picks/2020-04-03-harry-potter) is also currently available as an unlimited eBook and eAudiobook and there is also a collection of [eBook classics](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/1055025) with multiple copies available. 	 

There are also some unlimited use eAudiobooks available via the [Borrowbox service](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/elibrary/borrowbox/). These include Counting by 7s by Holly Goldberg Sloan, The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald and Wed Wabbit by Lissa Evans.

Some of our libraries are already setting up their own [online book groups or discussions](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/online-and-streamed-events/book-and-film-groups/) via their Facebook pages. The Reading Agency also provide lots of tips and information for anyone of thinking of setting up their own in this [handy toolkit](https://tra-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/entries/document/4327/The_Reading_Agency_Covid-19_Toolkit_2020_V1__1___1_.pdf).
