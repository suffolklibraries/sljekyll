We held our fifth AGM on 28 September. The event was attended by nearly 120 people including representatives from our 44 library community groups.

The event is a legal requirement which includes certain formal elements but also serves as a celebration of the work of the organisation and the library service during the previous financial year. It also marked our fifth year of running Suffolk’s library service and included a heartfelt 'thank you' from the Suffolk Libraries Board to Alison Wheeler as this was her last AGM as CEO of Suffolk Libraries.

We are very grateful to Birketts Solicitors, East of England Co-op, Overdrive, Vertas, Ryan Insurance and Hughes Electrical who all sponsored the event.

The evening’s guest speaker was author Simon Brett who was very entertaining, giving a humorous account on his experiences as an author, visiting libraries and life in general. His newest book, [<cite>The Liar in the Library</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2201135), is available to reserve from our catalogue.

Board members Sylvia Knights and Colin Rockall were required to step down from the Board this year and nominations were sought from the membership to become a Board member.  Also, due to being co-opted to the Board, Sue Buck and Sarah Wilson were also required to step down. All four were successfully re-elected to the Board.

The voting for chair, vice chair and honorary secretary will take place at the first Board meeting after the AGM which is on Thursday 26 October 2017.
