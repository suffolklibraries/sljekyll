Thurston Library will be closed from Sunday 13 - Friday 18 October for an upgrade to the children's area and other improvements. It will reopen on Saturday 19 October.

The work is being funded by the Friends of Thurston Library, with contributions from Suffolk Libraries, Thurston Parish Council, Suffolk County Council and the Thurston '68 club.

The improvements will include a brand new interactive touchscreen whiteboard, two reading nooks, mobile shelving and new seating. The whiteboard will be used to show films using our new [Kanopy](/elibrary/kanopy/) service and host educational activities for children and young people.

Richard Fawcett, chair of The Friends of Thurston Library, said: "The Suffolk Libraries model has been very successful, and our friends group has worked positively in partnership with them in developing and improving Thurston Library. This is the latest and most significant of the many benefits the Friends have brought to enhance the library."

"People in Thurston have supported the Friends by coming to the events that have raised funds, and through their enthusiasm for all the library does for Thurston."

During this period, the library will not be running their regular activities or groups.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the closure. While the library is closed, you can use any other Suffolk library, the nearest being [Ixworth](/libraries/ixworth-library/) and [Elmswell](/libraries/elmswell-library/) and [Bury St Edmunds](/libraries/bury-st-edmunds-library/).

You can reserve and renew books through [our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/). Any library loans from Thurston due back during the closure will have their return date automatically extended until after the library reopens.
