Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>Black Water</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2125261), by Louise Doughty:

> "Harper wakes every night, terrified of the sounds outside his hut halfway up a mountain in Bali. He is afraid that his past as a mercenary has caught up with him - and that his life may now been in danger. As he waits to discover his fate, he meets Rita, a woman with her own past tragedy, and begins a passionate affair. Their relationship makes Harper realise that exile comes in many forms - but can Rita and Harper save each other while they are putting each other very much at risk?"
