Suffolk Libraries is currently unable to provide books from the county reserve in Lowestoft Library due to the lift being out of service.

The county reserve is a collection of older or locally significant fiction and non-fiction books which are kept in the basement of Lowestoft Library and can be requested from elsewhere across the county. It does not affect other books and items available from the main library.

County reserve items are stored in the libraryâ€™s basement, and many of the titles are large and heavy. As it is very difficult for staff to cope with the number of items being requested without a lift we have made the decision to close the county reserve for the time being. Customers will not be able to reserve these titles. We apologise for any inconvenience and will update customers when county reserve reopens.
