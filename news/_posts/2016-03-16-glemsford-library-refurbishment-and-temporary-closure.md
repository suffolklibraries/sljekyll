Glemsford Library will be closing temporarily for just over a week next month to enable refurbishment to take place. The library will be closed from Tuesday 12 April and reopening on Thursday 21 April.

The work will involve the library being repainted, cleaning the carpet, relocating computers, installing new furniture and shelving – including wheeled shelving &#8211; to make the library space more modern and flexible. There will also be other cosmetic improvements to improve the layout and look of the library space.

As the library will be reopening on the Queen’s birthday, the library will be celebrating with tea and cake for customers on Thursday 21 April.

Customers can use any other library during the closure with Clare, Long Melford, Sudbury and Lavenham being the closest. Any library loans due back during the closure will be extended to the following week.

The work is being funded by local developer contributions with support from the Friends of Glemsford Library.
