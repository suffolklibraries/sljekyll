Felixstowe Library will again be one of the key venues for the third Felixstowe Book Festival.

Several events are taking place in the library on 27 and 28 June and the focus for the library this year is hosting the children’s programme:

  * Saturday 27 June &#8211; author Amanda Brandon will be leading two interactive storytelling sessions for 3-7 year olds at 11am-12pm and 1-2pm, based on her picture books ‘A Scarf and a Half’ and ‘A Box of Socks’
  * In the afternoon Mike Revell will be talking about his brilliant novel Stonebird (recommended for age 9 and up) from 3-4pm with children from local school book groups asking Mike questions.
  * On 28th June follow Alice down the rabbit hole and on a journey with storyteller Emily Rowe. There will be crafts, games and of course a Mad Hatter’s Tea Party! There will be a session for 4-7 year olds from 1-2:30pm and from 3pm-4:30pm for 8-11 year olds.

Felixstowe Library and Felixstowe Triangle are also giving out Book Trail entry forms. The Book Trail is a free family activity taking you round the town centre looking for hidden books in shop windows with a chance to win a prize.

The library will also be hosting three workshops for writers:

  * Saturday 27 June &#8211; Get Started in Comedy Writing, from 11am to 1pm. A workshop with comedy writer Tony Kirwood covering brainstorming raw material, how to translate this into comedy ideas and creating funny dialogue and memorable characters and storylines.
  * Saturday 27 June &#8211; Short Fiction Workshop, from 2pm to 3.30pm. Emma Kittle-Pey leads an introductory workshop to short fiction writing for all levels of writers.
  * Sunday 28 June &#8211; Mark Brayley – Performance and the Page, from 10am to 11.30am. Poet Mark Brayley will lead this workshop exploring techniques for both performance and writing gained through his many years of experience.

There are many more events taking place and the full programme and booking details for the festival are available at [www.felixstowebookfestival.co.uk](http://www.felixstowebookfestival.co.uk).
