This week is Children’s Book Week and Suffolk Libraries are celebrating by launching a new reading resource for young children and their families.

BookTrust has recently introduced new <cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure</cite> sticker books and Suffolk Libraries has distributed nearly 4,000 throughout the county’s libraries.

<cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure</cite> is a new sticker storybook aimed at children aged 0-5 which has ten missing stickers for them to collect.  It was developed following consultation with library services over ways to encourage families to visit the library and read together every day. Suffolk Libraries tested the storybooks on a small number of families last year and they proved very popular.

Krystal Vittles, Innovation and Development Manager at Suffolk Libraries, said:

“We are delighted to be able to be able to share this new resource which has been provided by Booktrust. <cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure</cite> is designed to help libraries achieve the aims of the Association of Senior Children’s and Education Librarians’ (ASCEL) Children’s Promise, to provide opportunities for families to participate and engage with their local library services and to make library visits inspiring and exciting. We hope many young families will be visiting the library to get their free pack.”

Children will be given a new sticker as an incentive every time they visit the library to encourage families to use the library more regularly. When a child has collected all ten stickers they can download a certificate to celebrate their success. <cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure</cite> also contains tips for families on how they can have fun reading together every day.

Several libraries will be celebrating the launch of <cite>Bear’s Reading Adventure</cite> with special Teddy Bears' Picnic events next Thursday (10 November). Event details are as follows:
