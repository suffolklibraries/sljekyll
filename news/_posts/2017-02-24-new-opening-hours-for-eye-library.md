Following a recent consultation with customers, Eye Library will be changing its opening hours in April.

The new hours will mean the library is open for the same number of hours, but will open and close slightly earlier most days to meet local demand.

The new opening hours will come into effect on Saturday 1 April and the changes are as follows:

* Monday - closed (no change)
* Tuesday - 9am-1pm (opening 30 mins earlier)
* Wednesday - 9am-1pm and 2pm-6pm (open 30 mins earlier and closing 30 mins later)
* Thursday - 2pm-5pm (closing 30 mins earlier)
* Friday - 9am-1pm and 2pm-5pm (opening 30 mins earlier and closing two hours earlier)
* Saturday - 9amâ€“1pm (opening 30 mins earlier)
* Sunday - 10am-3pm (no change)

Customers and local people were asked about the changes with 100 people responding and Suffolk Libraries Board, Suffolk County Council and Eye Library Friends have all approved the change.

Eye Library manager Julie Shepherd said: "we have not reviewed the library opening hours for several years and we hope that opening earlier will make it easier for local people to use the library. Many items are returned via the library dropbox before the current opening times, so we hope by moving the hours from our Friday evening session when the library is a bit quieter, to earlier morning opening, will result in a more accessible and popular service for our users."
