Live music returns to Ipswich County Library on Saturday 13 May when local Americana band Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs headline a show, supported by folk singer Fern Teather and acoustic punkster Doozer McDooze.

The library has hosted several successful gigs over the last 18 months, including funk band Primo Nelson and the ‘chap-hop’ act Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer. The latest gig will showcase some great acts from the local music scene, with tickets costing just £5.

Suffolk Libraries community lead Daniel Harvey said: "This will be a great evening of local music with lots of variety. Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs are a full on Americana band with a big sound and massive harmonies. Doozer McDooze is a great songwriter and a real foot stomping punky solo act who strums the guitar more aggressively than anyone I’ve ever seen! Fern Teather is a really classy folk singer and songwriter – and her partner Sam is a real wizard on percussion.

"There’s something great about the library as a music venue – there always seems to be such a great, happy vibe in the room at the gigs we’ve put on and I’m sure this gig will be just the same!"

For more information about the evening and to book tickets, please see the [Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs event details](/events/ipswich-2017-05-13-helen-and-the-neighbourhood-dogs/) There will be a reasonably priced bar at the event selling a selection of beer, cider, wine and soft drinks. Profits from the event will go to the Friends of Ipswich County Library.

Tickets cost £7. For more information, please see <a href="/events/ipswich-2017-11-11-the-vagaband/">The Vagaband event details</a>.</p>
