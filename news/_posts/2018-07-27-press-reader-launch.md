Suffolk Libraries has launched an exciting new [eLibrary](/elibrary/) service giving anyone with a library card free online access to a wide range of top newspaper and magazine titles from around the world.

[PressReader](/elibrary/press-reader/) provides access to full digital editions of nearly all major national UK newspapers, including <cite>The Guardian</cite>, <cite>The Observer</cite>, <cite>The Independent</cite>, <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite>, <cite>Sunday Telegraph</cite>, <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, <cite>Daily Express</cite>, <cite>Mirror</cite> and <cite>Daily Star</cite>. A wide range of top UK magazines are also available, covering a broad range of subjects and audiences. These include <cite>The Beano</cite>, which is the theme of this year's [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/).

PressReader also gives access to digital copies of major newspapers and magazines from around the world in their original language, and can translate text into different languages, so people whose first language is not English can read content in their native tongue. It also has the facility to enlarge and read text aloud, making it accessible to people with visual impairments.

Anyone with a Suffolk Libraries account can access PressReader content from anywhere at any time via a web browser or free Android or iOS app. Customers can access as many titles as they wish and download them to read offline.

Paul Howarth, Suffolk Libraries head of stock and content, said: “We’re very pleased to be able to add PressReader to [our increasingly popular range of eLibrary services](/news/elibrary-services-popular/) and provide more choice to our customers. Our customers can already access thousands of eBooks, eMagazines and eAudio books and they can download and stream music for free. We’ve seen an increase in the popularity of these services every year.”
