Suffolk Libraries has recently been working with Macmillan Cancer Support to provide new and updated information leaflets about a range of cancer-related issues from our libraries.

The 20 different leaflets provided by Macmillan offer a wealth of information about cancer, possible side-effects and treatment options. Having access to up-to-date, reliable information helps people to understand their condition and treatment, and feel more in control about what is happening to them.

These leaflets have also now been converted into digital versions which can be accessed online via our eBook service [Overdrive](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/1049070) in a new Health and Wellbeing section.

There will also be three new cancer book collections which are going to be held at Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich County and Lowestoft libraries.
