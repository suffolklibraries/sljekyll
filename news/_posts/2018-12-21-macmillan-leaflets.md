Suffolk Libraries has recently been working with Macmillan Cancer to provide new and updated information leaflets about a range of cancer related issues from our libraries.

The 20 different leaflets provide information on a range of issues which could be useful for anyone affected by cancer. These leaflets have also now been converted into digital versions which can be accessed online via our eBook service [Overdrive](/elibrary/overdrive/) in a new [Health and Wellbeing section](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/233408).

There will also be three new cancer book collections which are going to be held at Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich County and Lowestoft libraries.
