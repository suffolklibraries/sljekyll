Long Melford Library will be closed for refurbishment from 25 March - 1 April. It will reopen on Tuesday 2 April with increased opening hours.

The changes mean the library will have longer and more consistent hours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It will now be open on Saturdays, but closed on Sundays. Due to changes in staffing arrangements, the additional hours have been added at minimal cost to Suffolk Libraries.

The changes have been made following a recent consultation with customers, and have been formally approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.

**The new opening hours from 1 April are:**

* Monday: closed (no change)
* Tuesday: 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5:30pm)
* Wednesday: 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 5pm)
* Thursday - closed (no change)
* Friday: 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (currently 2pm - 7pm)
* Saturday: 9am - 1pm (currently closed)
* Sunday: closed (currently 12pm - 4:30pm)

Library manager Jack Norman said: "We are closing from 25 March to 1 April for refurbishment that has been funded by developer contributions and the Friends of Long Melford Library. We are hoping to make the space more modern, welcoming and flexible so we can put on more activities for all ages such as crafts, coding and IT sessions."

During this refurbishment period, the library will not be running their regular activities such as Baby Bounce and Tot Rock, Top Time and Knit and Natter, Stitch and Chatter.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the closure. While the library is closed, you can use any other Suffolk library, the nearest being [Sudbury](/libraries/sudbury-library/) and [Glemsford](/libraries/glemsford-library/). You can reserve and renew books through [our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/).
