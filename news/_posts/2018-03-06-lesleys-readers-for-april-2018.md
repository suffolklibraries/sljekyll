Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>Slow Horses</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2004015), by Mick Herron:

> "Slough House is a dumping ground for members of the intelligence service who've screwed up. Bitterest amongst them is River Cartwright, whose days are now spent transcribing phone conversations. But when a young man is abducted, and threatened to be beheaded live on the Internet, River sees an opportunity to redeem himself."

If you've read the book, why not join in the discussion at 2:30pm
