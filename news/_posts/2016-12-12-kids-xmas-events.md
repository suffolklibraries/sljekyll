When you're a child, the last few days before Christmas seem to go incredibly slowly. We've got some great activities going on in our libraries to entertain your children in the run-up to the big day.

## Meet Father Christmas

No child's festive season is complete without seeing Father Christmas, and we're happy to announce that he will be visiting some of our libraries to take requests and issue gifts. Children can meet him at [Chantry Library on Thursday 15 December](/events/chantry-2016-12-15-father-christmas/) and after a special Christmas storytime at [Haverhill Library on Tuesday 20 December](/events/haverhill-2016-12-20-xmas-storytime/) ([write him a letter](/events/haverhill-2016-12-01-father-xmas-letters/) before Friday 16 December and receive a personal reply!).

He's going to be enjoying an extended winter stay in Sudbury, thanks to Sudbury Rotary Club, appearing at Sudbury Library on [Friday 16 December](/events/sudbury-2016-12-16-santas-grotto/), [Saturday 17 December](/events/sudbury-2016-12-17-santas-grotto/), [Wednesday 21 December](/events/sudbury-2016-12-21-santas-grotto/), [Thursday 22 December](/events/sudbury-2016-12-22-santas-grotto/) and [Friday 23 December](/events/sudbury-2016-12-23-santas-grotto/).

## Craft activities

We're also holding craft sessions to keep your children occupied during the holidays and help them produce beautiful decorations. Many of our [regular craft sessions for children](/events-activities/children/) will be Christmas-themed this month. Children can also help Capel St Mary Library produce a handprint Christmas wall on [Friday 16 December](/events/capel-2016-12-16-xmas-wall-fri-16/), [Saturday 17 December](/events/capel-2016-12-17-xmas-wall-sat-17/) and [Sunday 18 December](/events/capel-2016-12-18-xmas-wall-sun-18/).

Haverhill Library are offering the opportunity to make some festive essentials in the form of [decorated ceramic plates for Santa's treats on Sunday 18 December](/events/haverhill-2016-12-18-xmas-plates-18/) and ['Santa stop here' signs on Monday 19 December](/events/haverhill-2016-12-19-xmas-crafts/), while at children can create quirky tortoise-shaped decorations at [Southwold Library on Thursday 22 December](/events/southwold-2016-12-22-festive-tortoise/).

## Competitions

Drop in to Haverhill Library to pick up a [Friends of Southwold Library quiz sheet](/events/haverhill-2016-12-05-xmas-quiz/). This festive quiz is suitable for the whole family. Complete and return it by Friday 6 January for the chance to win a top prize of tickets for a family of 4 to see <cite>Cinderella</cite> at Haverhill Arts Centre, courtesy of Centre Stage.

Alternatively, if your child is a budding artist, they might want to enter [Southwold Library's colouring competition](/events/southwold-2016-11-14-pantomime-competition/), which runs until Sunday 15 January, for the chance to win tickets for a family of 4 to see Reydon and Southwold Pantomime Group's production of <cite>Aladdin</cite>.

## Screenings

Capel St Mary Library are showing [Disney's <cite>Pete's Dragon</cite> on Friday 23 January](/events/capel-2016-12-23-petes-dragon/). If your child loves to dance, why not take them to see the Presents screening of New York City Ballet's <cite>The Nutcracker</cite> at [Lowestoft Library on Friday 16 December](/events/lowestoft-2016-12-16-nutcracker/) or [Gainsborough Library on Thursday 22 December](/events/gainsborough-2016-12-22-nutcracker/)?

Older children, especially those whose favourite subject is English literature, might enjoy Ixworth Library's Presents screening of [Shakespeare's <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> on Sunday 18 December](/events/ixworth-2016-12-18-presents-twelfth-night/).

Whatever your child's interests, we should have something that can make those last few days before Christmas go a little bit more quickly for them!
