Elmswell Library is set to reopen Tuesday 20 October following a massive refurbishment funded by generous fundraisers and local businesses.

Elmswell Library Friends have raised more than Â£15,000 over the past three years. It will be spent on turning the village facility into a modern, flexible space, with moveable shelving, new carpeting with dementia friendly aspects and a redesigned layout.

Students from West Suffolk College on the City & Guilds painting and decorating course have been giving their time for free to the project. On a rotation basis, 30 students and two lecturers have helped completely redecorate the building, and the materials for the project were all donated by Jewsons.

Decorating lecturer Mark Ames said:

> Working on the refurbishment of Elmswell Library has been fantastic opportunity for our decorating students. It has not only enabled them to get a taste of a real working environment, from the initial planning aspects of the job right through to the development of the skills required to do the actual tasks, but it has also provided a great opportunity to provide a service to the local community. All of our students are required to complete a minimum of 40 hours real work experience for their qualification. Decorating Elmswell Library has been great, as it has helped our students progress with their qualification, not only in aspects of their decorating skill levels but also with their communication skills and confidence with talking to a potential client or members of the public.

Manager Emma Yarrow has been bowled over by the work carried out:

> What is great about this project is that not only are the students helping us to give the community an updated facility, but we are hopefully giving them some valuable experience and helping them pass their diplomas with flying colours.
