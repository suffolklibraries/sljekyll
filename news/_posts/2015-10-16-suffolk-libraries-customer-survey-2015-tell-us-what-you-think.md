We’re launching a new customer survey to ask everyone what they think of Suffolk’s public library services.

Suffolk Libraries is keen to hear from as many people as possible – it doesn’t matter how often you visit the library, or if you mainly use online services – we’d love to hear from you.

We last carried out a customer survey in 2013 and believe it’s really important to keep in touch with customers and find out their views on the library service.

Paper copies are also being made available in all libraries. You can skip any questions you feel don’t apply to you and if you use more than one library on a regular basis you are welcome to fill it in for every library you visit. We’re also keen to hear from people who rarely or never use library services.
