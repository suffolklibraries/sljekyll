Rosehill Library in Ipswich is closing for five weeks from Monday 5 June to enable building work and refurbishment to improve the library’s facilities and accessibility, including adding a public toilet.

The work will also mean the library’s car park will be closed from Monday 8 May until after the work is complete to allow some initial building work to start. The library and car park will reopen during the week of Monday 10 July.

Suffolk County Council is funding the work, which will include:

- a fully accessible public toilet with baby changing facilities
- an extension to provide additional storage
- a staff area and kitchen facilities to provide refreshments for events

The layout of the library will also be improved and the carpet will be replaced.

We apologise for the inconvenience, particularly for the long closure period, but the work planned is important and it will not be possible to maintain safe access for staff and customers during the work. The plan will mean the library is open for the spring half term and will reopen in time for the Summer Reading Challenge.

[Rosehill Library](/libraries/rosehill-library/) is 112 years old and the last significant improvement work was carried out in 2003. This project will improve the library environment and facilities for everyone who uses it. During the closure customers can use any other library with the nearest being [Gainsborough Library](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/) and [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library). Any library loans due back during the closure period will be automatically extended.
