Suffolk Libraries is aiming to increase the positive impact that the county’s library service has on children’s literacy thanks to the arrival of a new member of staff who will be working directly with schools.

Matt Shenton has joined Suffolk Libraries this week as the new Literacy Ambassador – a post funded from a successful bid to the Foyle Foundation.

Matt will work with schools and other organisations to promote the benefits of library use and with an aim for all Year 7 children across the county to have their own library card. Matt will also be visiting schools and working with other organisations.

Matt Shenton said:

> I’m thrilled about taking up this new position. I believe the library service can make a big impact on children’s literacy and I think that by working together with schools and other organisations we can help to ensure that every child and young person is reaching their potential and I’m looking forward to focusing on helping children who could benefit more from being a member of the library service.

Suffolk Libraries’ Literacy Project has been funded by a grant of £30,000 from the Foyle Foundation which is an independent grant-making trust which awards funding to charitable organisations involved with arts and learning.

Literacy levels in Suffolk remain a key challenge and one person in six struggles with poor literacy skills. Suffolk Libraries is also part of the new South East Ipswich Literacy Partnership.

Matt has joined Suffolk Libraries from the Four Dwellings Academy in Quinton, Birmingham where he was School Librarian and Head of Key Stage 3.
