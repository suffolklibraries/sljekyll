Elmswell Library is planning to spread some festive cheer to any local people who live on their own or may be feeling lonely or isolated in the run-up to Christmas.

Everyone is always welcome at the library but throughout December there will be a particularly warm welcome. Thanks to a donation of £50 from the East of England Co-op, customers can enjoy free tea, coffee, biscuits or mince pies while chatting to staff or other customers.

Emma Yarrow, Manager of Elmswell Library, said: “We’re always thinking about what more we could do for the community we serve and this year we want to create an even warmer welcome in the library. We know that it isn't all tinsel and jingle bells for everyone and that Christmas can be a lonely and isolating time for some people.”

“We are hoping to spread the word that it’s a perfect time to visit the library to meet some new people and find out more about what’s happening at the library and across the village. If you know someone who might be feeling a bit lonely, perhaps a neighbour or relative, please let them know they’re very welcome in our library.”

The library will also be collecting for Gatehouse Foodbank in Bury St Edmunds, welcoming donations of non-perishable items with plenty of time on the date stamp as well as toiletries to be distributed to people in need over Christmas.
