As part of the redevelopment of the council offices in Saxmundham, the base for the [Saxmundham mobile route](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/mobiles-home/) will move to the Waterloo Centre in Leiston on Monday 9th March.

This will become its permanent base so the route will be renamed Leiston Mobile Library.
