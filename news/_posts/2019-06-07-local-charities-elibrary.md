Suffolk Libraries is offering to help local wellbeing charities reach a wider audience by converting their information leaflets into digital versions and adding them to a new [Health and Wellbeing collection](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/1007899) on its [OverDrive eBook platform](/elibrary/overdrive/).

Several leaflets produced by Macmillan Cancer Support have already been added as free eBooks, making it easier for local people to access this information. We are keen to develop this new section, so are reaching out to other local health and wellbeing charities.

There is no cost involved and it could help more people access information quickly and save charities printing costs. The leaflets are converted to eBooks, which anyone with a Suffolk Libraries card can access for free using OverDrive.
