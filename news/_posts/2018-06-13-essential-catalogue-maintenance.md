Our [online catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk) won't be available from 20.00 13 June until 08.00 14 June.

This means the following online services won't be available:

- Renewing books online
- Placing online reservations
- Checking your account online

This is so we can perform essential maintenance on the website.

If you need to renew a title in this period, call 01473 351249 and leave a message. We'll ensure you don't incur any fines.

If you have any questions please call our customer service line on 01473 351249 or email help@suffolklibraries.co.uk
