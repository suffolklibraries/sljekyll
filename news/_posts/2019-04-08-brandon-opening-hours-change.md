Brandon Library will be changing its opening hours from Monday 20 May.

The changes have been made following a recent consultation with customers, and have been formally approved by the Suffolk Libraries Board and Suffolk County Council.

**The new opening hours from 20 May are:**

* Monday: closed (no change)
* Tuesday: 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Wednesday: 10am - 3pm (currently 10am - 2pm)
* Thursday - 10am - 5:30pm (no change)
* Friday: 10am - 6pm (currently 10am - 7pm)
* Saturday: 10am - 1pm and 2pm - 5pm (no change)
* Sunday: 10am - 3pm (no change)

Library manager Mat Sheldrick said: "the change to Brandon Library's opening hours brings our opening times more in line with other services within the Brandon Centre. It also enables us to extend our service offer on a Wednesday where it has been busier and process reservations more quickly. We have been trialling these changes already with great success."

Events and activities at the library are unaffected by the change.
