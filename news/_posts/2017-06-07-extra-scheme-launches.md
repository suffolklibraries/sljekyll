Suffolk Libraries has launched a new supporters' scheme. Suffolk Libraries Extra offers individuals and businesses the chance to make an annual donation to get more involved and help the library service as it faces financial challenges.

People can sign up at three different price levels: £20 for Silver membership, £50 for Gold, or £150 for Platinum. For more information and to apply, visit the [Suffolk Libraries Extra page](/extra/), call [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) or visit [any library](/libraries/). You can also email **extra@suffolklibraries.co.uk** if you have any questions about the scheme.

All money raised will go into a dedicated Development Fund which will be used to support and improve the services we provide.

Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries, said: "Suffolk Libraries is determined to provide the best service we can to the people of Suffolk and to make a positive difference to the lives of as many people that live here, even if we face continuing financial pressures. We want to do our bit and raise additional income which will be used to improve the services we provide to communities across Suffolk.

"All our other customers will continue to get the same free services and benefits, we just want to provide something extra for those who feel able to give us some extra support."
