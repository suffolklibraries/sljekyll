Suffolk Libraries will be working with ten of the county’s primary schools to set up new Chatterbooks reading clubs to support reading for pleasure and encourage more year three pupils to join the library.

The project will be supported by £2,000 of funding from the Department for Education as part of a national initiative. Suffolk Libraries is one of only 20 library services selected to run the project which is part of a government drive to get more Key Stage 2 pupils reading regularly.

Suffolk Libraries will be working with ten schools with lower than average literacy levels and a high pupil premium rate. The project will run until Spring 2016.

‘Chatterbooks’ reading clubs are an established way of encouraging children to read for pleasure and to develop reading as a lifelong habit. The programme has been co-ordinated by the Reading Agency since 2001. The clubs give children the chance to talk about books and reading and take part in engaging reading-related activities.

Suffolk Libraries’ recently relaunched [Literacy, Books and Reading Team for Schools (LBaRT)](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/community-services/literacy-books-and-reading-team-for-schools) will be working with each school to help them build up Chatterbooks groups of up to 20 pupils. The team already has extensive experience of supporting schools to run successful reading groups.

The funding has recently been announced after a successful bid by Suffolk Libraries.

Jacky Offord, Lead Advisory Librarian said: “Suffolk Libraries is thrilled to have been chosen to pilot the Chatterbooks scheme for Key Stage 2 pupils. This has come at the right time as many agencies in Suffolk are working hard to improve educational outcomes for children and Suffolk Libraries can be part of the solution in terms of improving literacy levels.

“Our Literacy, Books and Reading Team who will be delivering this have the right knowledge and expertise to develop children’s reading skills. To support this project our team will also be working hard to sign-up year 3 pupils in the selected schools to their local library to help families make reading part of their everyday routine.”
