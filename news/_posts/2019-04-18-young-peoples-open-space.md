Suffolk Libraries is launching a new health and wellbeing group for young people at Chantry Library in partnership with NSFT (Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust) and 4YP (Suffolk Young People’s Health project).

The brand new Open Space group for 11-17 year-olds will be facilitated by NSFT psychologists, 4YP youth workers and library staff. It will meet from 3:30pm - 5:30pm every Thursday from 25 April and offers a relaxed and friendly drop-in style session with a timetable of discussions and activities chosen by the young people themselves, aimed at understanding and improving wellbeing.

All young people are welcome and there is no pressure to be take part. Each session will have free refreshments and games available.

Suffolk Libraries mental health and wellbeing coordinator Sarah Lungley is thrilled with the addition: "We are so happy to be launching a new group focusing on young people and their wellbeing. Our libraries can offer a neutral, safe environment, whilst offering access to a whole wealth of information and expertise.

"The Open Space programme has been designed working closely with mental health services and this has been key to its success. We are bringing information, support and advice into the heart of the community and breaking down barriers for those who are in need or who wish to learn more about their wellbeing."

NSFT clinical psychologist Dr Joanna Ringrose said: "The partnership working with Suffolk Libraries has meant we can offer specialist advice and information in a very flexible way. I am very excited at this new venture particularly aimed at young people."

Working in partnership, we currently co-facilitate [Open Space groups](/health/open-space/) for adults in seven libraries, all of which have proved to be successful and valuable assets to the community and those who attend the groups. The Open Space sessions were also [shortlisted for an award at this year’s EDGE Libraries Conference in Edinburgh](/news/edge-nomination/).
