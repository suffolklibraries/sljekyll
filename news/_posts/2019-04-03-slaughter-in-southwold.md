Southwold Library has launched the programme for the seventh annual Slaughter in Southwold crime writers' festival. Several renowned crime authors will be giving talks about their writing on Saturday 15 and Sunday 16 June at Southwold Arts Centre.

This year’s packed programme features Kate Ellis, Mick Herron, Jill Dawson, Val McDermid, Mark Dawson, Martin Edwards, Nicci French, Felix Francis and Elly Griffiths. There will also be a range of other activities on offer including a Murder Mystery Night based on the bestselling Shetland books by Ann Cleeves, a staged murder mystery musical penned by Sophie Hannah, a crime-themed quiz night and a chance to have a fish and chip lunch with the visiting authors. You can read the full programme and book tickets on the [Slaughter in Southwold page](/slaughter/)

The festival is organised by Southwold Library manager Charlotte Clark with support from the Friends of Southwold Library and the Crime Writers' Association. It is part of Southwold Arts Festival.

Charlotte said: "It’s wonderful how well-supported Slaughter in Southwold is by the local community and we are proud to bring big name crime authors to our small corner of Suffolk. Outside of our library customers it’s amazing now how far people travel now to enjoy the Slaughter weekend and we hope that the seventh festival is bigger and better than ever."

Slaughter in Southwold has been so successful that it inspired another Suffolk Libraries crime writers' festival. The second [Skulduggery in Stowmarket](/skulduggery/) takes place from 26 - 29 April.
