Everyone at Suffolk Libraries would like to congratulate Maggie Lusher, manager of Kesgrave Library, who was the winner of the Services to the Community award at the recent Suffolk Coastal Business and Community Awards.

The award was given in recognition of her work “transforming Kesgrave Library into a thriving and much-loved community facility which meets the needs of children and families in the area.” Maggie was nominated by Liz Ditton from the [Kesgrave Library Community Group](/about/member-organisations/kesgrave-library-community-group/).

News of the award came just after Kesgrave Library also opened its new and improved ‘comfy corner’ thanks to generous funding from [Anglia Research](https://www.angliaresearch.co.uk/), a leading genealogy company based in Ipswich.  

The ‘comfy corner’ was unveiled at a special Paddington Bear themed event recently and comprises brand new comfortable chairs and furniture. Anglia Research donated nearly £1,500 to the library for these improvements, with Rushmere St Andrew Parish Council also donating £200.

Philip Turvey, Executive Director of Anglia Research said: “We are proud to be supporting our local community. The new look of the ‘comfy corner’ will be of great benefit for the children of local families, including many of our employees’ children.” 

We are also planning to [increase opening hours at Kesgrave Library and encourage customers to have their say](/news/extra-kesgrave-hours/).
