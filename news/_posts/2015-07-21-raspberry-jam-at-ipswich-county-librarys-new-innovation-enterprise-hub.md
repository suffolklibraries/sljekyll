A ‘Raspberry Jam’ event showcasing what the Raspberry Pi computer can offer is being held at Ipswich County Library’s new Enterprise and Innovation Hub on Saturday 8 August.

Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program. It’s an exciting educational tool which is a great way of introducing people to programming computers and helping them understand how computers work.

The event will feature two sessions – one from 10am to 1pm and a second from 1pm to 4pm. The sessions will include presentations and workshops with the morning session aimed at anyone new to Raspberry Pi in the morning and the afternoon session geared up for some who are already using it.

You don’t have to be a Raspberry Pi fan or user to benefit from the day. If you want to learn code, for work, a project or to start making your own games there will be people that write code for a living that can help you get started.

If you love electronics, want to learn more about wiring and tinkering there are technicians and programmers at the event. Tickets are £1.50 each and can be purchased online. Under 16s should be accompanied by an adult. There are further details about the workshops at [www.ipswichraspberryjam.co.uk](http://www.ipswichraspberryjam.co.uk).

The Enterprise + Innovation Hub is on the second floor of Ipswich County Library in Northgate Street and was officially opened in June. For more information visit [www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/hub](/branches/hub/).
