Suffolk Libraries is one of a handful of English library services chosen to pilot a new eBook service.

US based company Bibliotheca is launching its 3M Cloud Library eBook and audiobook lending service for public library services in the UK, following successful launches in the US and Canada.

Suffolk will be trialling the 3M Cloud Library platform over the next year and has been helping to advise Bibliotheca over its development in the UK. The new service will be run alongside the existing eBook catalogue and will mean Suffolk library customers will have access to an ever greater choice of free eBooks.

The 3M Cloud Library will provide content from all major publishers, curated by digital experts in the UK to ensure that relevant titles are available for library users. The 3M Cloud Library can be accessed online, through eReaders, phones and via an easy-to-use app and there is also a Discovery Station which will initially be based at Ipswich County Library.

Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries said:

> We have seen the number of eBooks borrowed by library customers grow significantly year after year and we’re now lending well over 75,000 ebooks a year. We are always looking at how we can ensure that our customers can access a wide range of relevant titles and being involved in the development of the Cloud Library in the UK means that they’ll have access to even more choice whilst we’re helping to trial it.

Chris Millican, Bibliotheca UK’s Commercial Manager, said:

> The Cloud Library has been the premier method for eBook lending in the US and Canada for the past four years, with the recent enhancement to provide audiobooks as well. It’s now time for UK libraries to experience the best in class library e-lending solution available. Cloud Library has proven to be a favourite for US and CA library users, with reviews and rankings proving how simple, convenient and enjoyable the entire experience is.

The service will be launched at Ipswich County Library on Tuesday 23 February where members of Bibliotheca’s Cloud Library team will be on hand from 9.30am to 4pm to demonstrate the Cloud Library on a special Discovery Station. The service will be available across the county to everyone with a Suffolk Libraries account. There is more information on how to access the service via the eLibrary section on the Suffolk Libraries website.

The new service won’t affect the current Suffolk Libraries eBook service as customers can continue to use this alongside the new Cloud Library.
