Due to reductions in Suffolk Libraries’ stock budget, we reviewed our online and physical reference stock in 2016 and made a number of changes. This has included cancelling some of our online subscriptions:

- The Times Digital Archive
- British Library 19th Century Newspapers
- Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
- Oxford English Dictionary
- A number of other, specialist information resources

We have removed these particular sites due to the high cost, compared to the number of people who use them. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience. We will of course continue to monitor demand for information resources and review this decision on an ongoing basis and always welcome feedback from customers.

We have no current plans to remove access to any of the other information and research sites on our website.  

If you have any comments please email **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.
