Suffolk Libraries held its sixth Annual General Meeting on Tuesday 25 September.

Our AGM is a formal meeting, attended by representatives of the 44 community groups who support the county’s libraries. It also provides an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of Suffolk Libraries over the past year and the great work being done by library staff with the support of the community groups. We have summarised these in our [Annual Review for 2017-18](/assets/pdf/suffolk-libraries-annual-review-2017-2018.pdf).

At the meeting Sally Irvine from the Aldeburgh Library Friends was announced as the new member of the [Suffolk Libraries Board](/about/board-members/).

David Sheepshanks CBE was the guest speaker and gave a very inspiring speech about the important role of libraries in the Suffolk community. He also reminisced about his time as Chairman of Ipswich Town Football Club.

The Suffolk Libraries Volunteer Awards were also held at the AGM. The winning volunteers were nominated for regularly going above and beyond the call of duty and for being hugely valuable to Suffolk Libraries. They were:

* Young Volunteer – Erin Keeble (Rosehill Library)
* Summer Reading Challenge Volunteer – Tracy Dix (Leiston Library)
* Home Library Service Volunteer – Mary Joels (Rosehill)
* Library Volunteer – Marie-Anne MacKenzie (Highpoint North Prison Library)
* Friends Group Volunteer – Colin Mayes (Gainsborough Community Library)
* Special Award – Sylvia Knights (Bungay Library)

From these winners a ‘Volunteer of the Year’ prize was also awarded to Mary Joels.

We are very grateful to Birketts Solicitors, East of England Co-op, OverDrive, Vertas, Ryan Insurance, PS Human Resources, FG Group and Eclipse Business Furniture for sponsoring the event.
