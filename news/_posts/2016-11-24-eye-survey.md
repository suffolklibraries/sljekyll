Eye Library are considering changing their opening hours in order to meet more customers' needs.

They are proposing opening earlier on most days. They would close earlier or later on some days as well, meaning the library would be open for the same number of hours overall.

Before making any changes they want to canvas the views of as many customers as possible about the proposals, as well as collect some further information about their use of and thoughts about the library.

To share your opinion on the proposed changes, please [fill in this short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/eyelibrary) which closes on Friday 13 January 2017.
