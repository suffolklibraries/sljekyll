From 1 - 15 October, you can borrow <cite>The Girl with the Red Balloon</cite> by Katherine Locke on OverDrive without a wait list and join in a worldwide discussion.

> "When sixteen-year-old Ellie Baum accidentally time-travels via red balloon to 1988 East Berlin, she’s caught up in a conspiracy of history and magic.

> "She meets members of an underground guild in East Berlin who use balloons and magic to help people escape over the Wall — but even to the balloon makers, Ellie’s time travel is a mystery. When it becomes clear that someone is using dark magic to change history, Ellie must risk everything — including her only way home — to stop the process."
