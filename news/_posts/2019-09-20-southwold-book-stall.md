Enterprising Summer Reading Challengers Ivy and Bertie recently surprised staff at Southwold Library by raising £78 with their very own book sale.

The young fundraisers set up a book stall near their home and sold books and magazines they no longer wanted to passers-by, then donated the proceeds to the library.

Southwold Library manager Charlotte Clark said: "We couldn't believe it when Bertie and Ivy came in to tell us they had very kindly had a book stand outside their house to raise funds for Suffolk Libraries. We were so touched that they had thought of us and raised an amazing £78! So a big thank you to those terrific kids and all who donated."

Parents Nicola and Lucas said: "We decided to help raise funds for our local library in Southwold because we are so impressed with all the hard work done by the local staff to lay on activities during the school holidays. None of this can be achieved without funding and at a time when local authorities are feeling the pinch, we wanted to do everything we could to support such a valuable asset to our local community."

Suffolk Libraries is an independent and charitable organisation which has been contracted to run the county's library service since 2012. [Find out how you can support your libraries &rarr;](/support-us/)
