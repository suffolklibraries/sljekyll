Customers still using the Zinio app for eMagazines are advised to download the RBdigital app by 3 April.

[The RBdigital app was introduced to replace the Zinio app six months ago](/news/changes-to-our-emagazine-service/), with the two apps being temporarily available concurrently to allow customers time to migrate.

This migratory period is now coming to an end and the Zinio app will no longer work from the beginning of April. Visit our [RBdigital instructions page](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/elibrary/rbdigital/) to find out how to download the new app.

Although the name of the service and the app has changed, its functionality has not. As before, you can use your Suffolk Libraries account to download as many current and previous issues of the 60+ free magazines on offer as you like and keep them forever. If you have not used our eMagazine service before, follow the link above to find out more.
