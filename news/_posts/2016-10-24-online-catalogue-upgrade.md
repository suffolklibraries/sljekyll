We will be upgrading our [online library catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk) from 31 October to 9 November 2016. This is where you place reservations, renew books and review your library account online.

This work will provide several benefits:

- An improved, easier to use layout
- An improved search facility
- The catalogue will be easier to use on mobile devices

All library services will remain available during the upgrade but customers should be aware of the following:

- We **cannot accept new reservations during this period** (either online or in the library)
- Reservations placed before the start of the upgrade will be processed
- No overdue notices can be sent during the upgrade. **We will automatically extend return dates for books due during this period to 11 November**.
- Reservations and pre-overdue notices will continue to be issued.

The upgrade is an essential part of developing and improving the library catalogue. We apologise for any inconvenience this work causes.
