A blue plaque was installed at [Rosehill Library](/libraries/rosehill-library/) in Ipswich last week. The branch was the first public library building to open in Ipswich, 114 years ago.

The plaque, which was funded by the Friends of Rosehill Library, reads: "Funded by public subscription: Rosehill Library was opened for the benefit of the people of Ipswich on 24th May 1905".

Like all of the county's libraries, Rosehill Library has been run by Suffolk Libraries since 2012. In 2015, it celebrated its 110th birthday with the Mayor of Ipswich, library staff, customers and the Friends of Rosehill Library in attendance. It has undergone several changes in the past century, including a major makeover in 2017.

Kate Byford, Manager of Rosehill Library, said: "I am delighted that the Rosehill Library Friends have funded the plaque to celebrate the opening of the library and emphasise that it was paid for by public subscription."

As well as offering books, wifi and computing and printing facilities, the library runs a number of regular events including Baby Bounce and Tot Rock for 0-5 year-olds and their parents/carers, craft and book groups for children, an adult colouring session and a social group for over-55s.

Rosehill Library is currently running a [consultation about changes to its opening hours](/news/rosehill-opening-hours-survey/). It proposes to maintain the total number of opening hours, but open earlier on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and close earlier on Fridays. Customers have until Tuesday 26 November to have their say about the proposals.
