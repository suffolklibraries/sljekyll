Aldeburgh Library will be closed for refurbishment from 24 - 30 June, reopening on Monday 1 July.

The work will increase the internal space at the library and improve the outside area and entrance. It is being carried out by Duncan & Son (Southwold) Ltd and we hope that it will further improve the library space for the local community.

For a short period of time following the closure, access to the library will also be limited for disabled people while builders construct a new external glazed lobby. Staff will be happy to offer assistance to customers who may have difficulty in accessing the building.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this temporary closure and have tried to plan the work to keep disruption to a minimum. Any library loans due back during the closure will be automatically extended and local residents are welcome to use any other library during the closure, the nearest being [Leiston](/libraries/leiston-library/) and [Saxmundham](/libraries/saxmundham-library/).
