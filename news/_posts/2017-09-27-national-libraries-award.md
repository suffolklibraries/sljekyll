Ipswich County Library's Chat n Chill project is one of four library programmes shortlisted for the prestigious CILIP Libraries Change Lives Award.

The Chat n Chill group, which has been running for eight years, empowers women from diverse and international backgrounds through self-directed learning and resilience. Its members learn and build confidence in life skills such as banking, reading utility bills and visiting the doctor and are helped to integrate, practice their English, make friends and feel welcome.

Many members go on to learn further skills at spin-off sessions and take part in community activities. The project was also nominated for an <cite>East Anglian Daily Times</cite> Business Award, in the Social Inclusion category, earlier this year.

The Libraries Change Lives Award recognises the work of libraries in driving integration and social cohesion and improving the health and life chances of individuals in their communities. It focusses on innovation, intelligent service design and best practice.

The winner of the award will be announced at a ceremony in London in October. You can find out more about the award and watch a video about each of the shortlisted projects on the [CILIP website](https://archive.cilip.org.uk/advocacy-awards/libraries-change-lives-award/libraries-change-lives-2017-shortlist).
