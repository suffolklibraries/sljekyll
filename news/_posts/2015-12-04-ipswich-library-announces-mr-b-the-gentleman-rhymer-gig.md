Mr B the Gentleman Rhymer is to return to Ipswich next year. The dapper rapper will give a one-off performance at Ipswich County Library on Saturday 5 March.

The world’s leading exponent of chap-hop, the musical marriage of civility and street, where Edwardian manners meet lyrical mastery, said, “It is wonderful to be returning to Ipswich, where I played many of my early shows and to be playing at a seat of learning such as the County Library will be quite an honour.”

Support comes from Cambridge’s celebrated electronic musical artist Pete Um, who recently supported Hot Chip on their UK arena tour to great acclaim.

[Tickets are available now](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/date/FEKHEJ) for this unmissable affair, which cost £9 plus booking fee and will soon be available to buy over the counter at Ipswich County Library. If there are any tickets remaining, entry on the night will cost £11. Doors will be open at 7.30pm and a fully-licensed bar will be available on the premises.

The event follows the success of a sell-out show at Ipswich Library featuring Americana band Police Dog Hogan early in November. The library has other live music performances scheduled for next year including ‘Dream Themes’, a band who specialise in playing television theme tunes, on Saturday 4 June, and Primo Nelson – a 12 piece funk band who will appear on Saturday 12 November.

Ipswich County Library Manager Marion Harvey said, “The Police Dog Hogan gig was the first big gig we’ve hosted and it was a massive success which attracted a big audience, so we were eager to get some more live music to the library next year. We’re delighted to secure Mr B for the March date, as well as Dream Themes and Primo Nelson later in the year.”
