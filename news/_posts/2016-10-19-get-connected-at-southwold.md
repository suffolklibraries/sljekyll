Southwold Library is holding a Get Connected event this Friday (21 October) where it will launch a new iPad lending service.

Get Connected events are a chance for people to get expert help and information on the free eBooks, eAudio books, eMagazines, and music downloads available from Suffolk Libraries. At this event, the library is also launching a new service offering iPads for loan, thanks to the support of the Friends of Southwold Libraries and Hughes Electrical who are supplying the iPads.

The event also coincides with [Get Online Week](https://www.getonlineweek.com/) and will include two sessions between 10am and 1pm and 2pm and 6pm which are open to everyone. The event will also be an ideal opportunity to try out a tablet or eReader or bring your own device to get advice on using it.

Southwold is the latest library in Suffolk to be launching an iPad lending service, with Halesworth and Kedington libraries already offering the service and Clare Library launching theirs on 29 October. Several other libraries will also be launching similar schemes in the near future.

Helen Haynes, Suffolk Libraries Information and Content Librarian, said: “We believe our iPad lending scheme is unique in the UK as from our research we could find nothing else like it, and in fact had to contact libraries in the USA for advice on how best to run the scheme.

“We successfully trialled it at Halesworth Library last year where we partnered with Hughes Electrical who provided a selection of tablets together with members of staff to provide the necessary expertise.

“It is a great way to promote our eLibrary services, while also showing people how they can help with other parts of their lives, be it banking, booking tickets for events or using email and surfing the web.”
