Beccles Library will be closing for one week in June for refurbishment and improvements.

The library will be closed from Monday 18 - Sunday 24 June and will reopen at the usual opening time of 9:30am on Monday 25 June. The work will include the installation of improved shelving and new carpet and improvements to the library's layout. The work is being funded by the Beccles Library Community Trust.

We apologise for any inconvenience to customers caused by the closure. Customers can use any other Suffolk library, with [Bungay Library](/libraries/bungay-library) being the closest. Any loans due back during the closure will have their return date extended.
