Our AGM took place on Thursday 11 September at the Suffolk Food Hall, just outside Ipswich. Around 100 people attended, including membership group representatives from all over the county.

Sylvia Knights of Bungay Community Library member group was re–elected to the board. Peter Callaghan of the Friends of Brandon Library and Colin Rockall of the Friends of Lavenham Library were elected as new board members.

The 2013–2014 accounts were approved, along with the 2013 AGM minutes.

Founder of National Poetry Day and leader of the government&#8217;s Independent Library Review William Sieghart addressed the meeting. He praised our membership model and divestment, saying it led to more meaningful community involvement and better procurement of services such as wifi. At a time when library services are under pressure, he sees our model as the way forward.
