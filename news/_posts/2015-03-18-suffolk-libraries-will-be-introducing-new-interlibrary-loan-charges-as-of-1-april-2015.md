Interlibrary loans are a way of sourcing more specialist titles from other library services.

The new charges will apply to anyone who requests a loan from the British Library, academic library or another library service outside Suffolk*.

The costs and charges for providing interlibrary loans were recently reviewed by the Suffolk Libraries Board as the current charges are heavily subsidised by Suffolk Libraries and do not reflect what most other library services charge.

It was felt that Suffolk Libraries has been absorbing too much of the cost of sourcing interlibrary loans when it is quite a specialised service used by only a relatively small proportion of customers.

Although we recognise that this will have an impact on the people who use the service, we feel that the new charges are fair and reflect what other library services charge. There will also be a staggered increase with a small increase this year and a further increase in April 2016.

The new charges from 1 April 2015 will be as follows:

## Standard service

The standard service will include loans from all non-British Library sources and the charge will increase to £3.00 in April 2015.

## Priority Service

This service covers loans from the British Library. The charge will increase to £10 in April 2015 plus a postage charge of £3.80.

After a further increase in April 2016, any future annual increases will be in line with British Library charges. Renewals from the British Library will also cost £4.55 per five week period in line with the cost to Suffolk Libraries.

*These charges do not apply to loans from Cambridgeshire Library Service as we share the same library catalogue system and a recent development means that Suffolk Customers can borrow items from Cambridgeshire for free and request an item for only £1.
