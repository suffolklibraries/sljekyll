Children and families are invited to join us for stories, crafts and more this summer.

Events that have been announced so far will particularly appeal to animal-lovers. Animal therapy association Kind Hart will be telling stories at several libraries with their very own owl, Glimfeather. Newmarket Library have organised dog and cat-themed events with animal charities Dogs Trust, Blue Cross and Cats Protection, while Chantry Library are offering children the opportunity to touch and learn about less cuddly animals with a visit from ZooLab's Motley Zoo.

Thanks to Tesco Bags of Help, Gainsborough Community Library are offering special coach trips to Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach on Tuesday 14 August and Lowestoft beach on Tuesday 21 August to families living in the IP3 area.

As ever, we're running the annual [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) for children aged 4-11. They can sign up at any of our libraries to read six library books of their choice and talk about them with a volunteer or member of staff for the chance to earn rewards and a certificate. Registration officially starts on Saturday 21 July, though some libraries hold early sign-up events for children who are eager to get started. This year's theme is Mischief Makers, to mark the 80th anniversary of iconic comic the <cite>Beano</cite>.

We're also encouraging young people aged 10-18 to take part in [ImagiNation](/events-activities/summer-holidays/imagination/), which offers them the opportunity to creatively express their feelings about the books they read and recommend them to others.
