This week it was announced that Suffolk would be one of the first Time to Change hubs in England, a new partnership of local organisations and mental health champions committed to improving local attitudes and behaviours towards people experiencing mental health problems.

The new hub is being created to combine insights from the Time to Change campaign, run by charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, with local knowledge to support communities, workplaces and schools to take action in their area. It’s part of Time to Change’s broader strategy to embed and sustain its social movement in local communities.

Time to Change Suffolk is led by the local Health and Wellbeing Board and is a partnership between Suffolk County Council, Healthwatch Suffolk, Suffolk User Forum, Suffolk Mind, Suffolk Family Carers and Suffolk Libraries, local Time to Change champions and regional co-ordinators.
