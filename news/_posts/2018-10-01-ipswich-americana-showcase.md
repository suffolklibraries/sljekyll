[Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/)’s growing reputation as a live music venue will be enhanced further on Saturday 13 October when the venue hosts a trio of top Americana acts.

The night will kick off with the harmony-drenched Suffolk based Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs. Hanna Haas – all the way from Portland, Oregon – will then take to the stage for a solo performance as part of her current UK tour. Hanna describes her music as ‘contemplative folk’, identifying with artists such as Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell.

The evening will be rounded off with a performance from the seven-piece Morganway from Norwich, a fiery Americana band featuring five-part harmonies and powerful riffs. The band have several notable achievements to their name, including a live session at Whispering Bob Harris’s studio, a nomination for a British Country Music Association award and a summer packed with festival performances.

The gig has been organised in partnership with local musician and writer Shane Kirk, who approached the library looking for a venue to host a gig.
Shane himself is guitarist and vocalist with the opening act, Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs, and is familiar face on the local music scene having featured in a number of top bands over the years.

Daniel Harvey, head of community and performance at Suffolk Libraries, said: "I know the library might seem like an unlikely venue for live music, but it always works so well and the atmosphere is always fantastic. We’re delighted that Shane got in touch as he’s put a brilliant line up of acts together."

Tickets for the event cost £8 each and are available from the main library desk on the ground floor and through [Ticketsource](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/date/538534) (online booking fee applies). Doors open at 7.30pm with live music from 8pm. There will be a licensed bar selling beers, wine, cider and soft drinks.
