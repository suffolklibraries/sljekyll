OverDrive have chosen this book for their Big Library Read, which creates "the only global eBook reading club". As with physical library books, OverDrive titles' availability is usually subject to demand from other users. By taking such restrictions off <cite>The Other Einstein</cite> for two weeks, OverDrive have given readers at thousands of libraries the opportunity to borrow this book simultaneously, encouraging them to read and discuss the book.

You can borrow <cite>The Other Einstein</cite>, find out more about the book and join the discussion from the [Suffolk Libraries OverDrive catalogue](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/). For help setting up OverDrive, please see [our OverDrive instructions page](/elibrary/overdrive/).
