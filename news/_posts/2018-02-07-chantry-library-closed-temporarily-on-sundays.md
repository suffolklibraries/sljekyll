Chantry Library will remain closed on Sundays for the next few weeks.

This is a temporary measure while we work with staff and other organisations to tackle some anti-social behaviour issues. Opening times on other days are unaffected.

We apologise to customers for any ongoing inconvenience but feel for the time being this measure is in the best interests of customers and staff, whose wellbeing is always our first priority.

Libraries are warm and welcoming places which are open to everyone and from time to time some visitors to the library act in a way which is detrimental to staff and other customers. We always take these issues very seriously and know from past experience that closing a library at certain times or on certain days for a short time can help to alleviate the issues.

The library had been closing on a Sunday during the Christmas period and we have decided, for the time being, to continue this.

The closest alternative library is [Stoke Library](/libraries/stoke-library/), which opens from 10am - 1pm on Sundays. 

The monthly health walk which starts from outside the library will still be going ahead as usual.
