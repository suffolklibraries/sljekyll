This year's Skulduggery in Stowmarket will take place at the library over four days from 26 - 29 April.

[Skulduggery in Stowmarket](/skulduggery/) was launched in 2018 and this year's event will again involve four days of talks from top crime authors and other activities. Speakers include Nicci French, James Henry, Sophie Hannah and Stella Duffy.

Jack Norman from Suffolk Libraries and the Skulduggery organising committee, said: "The first ever Skulduggery in Stowmarket event was a great success and we were keen to do it again this year.

"Crime fiction is a hugely popular genre and we hope many people will flock to Stowmarket to hear from some top crime authors both from Suffolk and further afield."

See our [Skulduggery in Stowmarket page](/events-activities/skulduggery-in-stowmarket/) for the full programme and further details about the festival. Tickets can be bought from [Stowmarket Library](/libraries/stowmarket-library/) and [TicketSource](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/stowmarket-library/).
