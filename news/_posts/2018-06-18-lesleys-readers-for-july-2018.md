Each month BBC Radio Suffolk presenter Lesley Dolphin discusses a book with journalist Catherine Larner as part of Lesley's Readers monthly book group.

This month's chosen book is [<cite>This is Going to Hurt</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2202141), by Adam Kay:

> "Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and <cite>This Is Going to Hurt</cite> intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands."
