Suffolk Libraries customers can now pay their charges online.

All existing loans at the time of lockdown were extended to July 2020 to prevent customers accruing fines for books they couldn’t return while self-isolating or because libraries are closed. However, many people will have historic charges on their account.

This change allows customers to clear any charges accrued on their account without needing to visit one of our libraries.

This can be done by [logging in to your Suffolk Libraries account](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/LOGINB?RDT=/SpydusCitizenPay/default.aspx) and selecting the option to pay online, which should appear if there are outstanding charges.

During the lockdown period, Suffolk Libraries have moved all events and activities online and continued to cultivate their extensive eLibrary service, which includes eBooks, eAudiobooks, films, newspapers and magazines.

Leon Paternoster, Head of Digital and Marketing, said:

“We’re delighted to be offering online payments, especially at a time when people are looking to move away from cash transactions where possible.

“The library is offering more of its activities online, such as book groups and children’s singalongs, and has had a strong eLibrary offer for years, so it makes sense to enable customers to do as much as possible from wherever they are.”

Library buildings have been closed since 20 March and many will be [reopening on 6 July](/news/libraries-to-reopen-from-early-july/).
