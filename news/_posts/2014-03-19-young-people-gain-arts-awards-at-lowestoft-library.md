Eight young people will be receiving their arts award at Lowestoft Library this Saturday (22 March).

The group took part in various arts activities and workshops at the library last year to achieve a Bronze Arts Award. The activities included author events, creative writing, photography and comic book making

This was the first time Suffolk Libraries has hosted an arts award.

Arts Awards are a set of qualifications awarded by Trinity College London which are aimed at young people from school age up to 25 years old. The Norfolk and Norwich Bridge Project awarded Lowestoft Library a start-up grant to enable young people to take part in the Bronze Arts Award.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To achieve Bronze, a Level 1 national qualification, young people take part in an arts activity they enjoy, go to an arts event, research their arts hero or heroine and share their skills with others. Their heroes ranged from Salvador Dali to Jacqueline Wilson, while the student-led workshops included origami and scrapbooking.</span>

Along the way they learnt from each other about sequin art, cake pops, painting and creative writing.

There are many advantages to offering an Arts Award in the library. Young people of different ages and abilities were able to get together to share their interests and enthusiasm outside a traditional learning environment. They helped and motivated each other and were able to freely use library resources – books, computers, space and the skills of library staff.

The moderator praised the standard of the young people’s work and the presentation of their portfolios. He was amazed at the library’s ability to deliver such a high quality Bronze Award in a public library.

Jane Rothon, Assistant Library Manager at Lowestoft Library, said: “We are incredibly proud of this achievement both for Lowestoft Library and our eight young people. Everyone at Lowestoft Library was delighted when we were chosen for the pilot project and it was an exciting and challenging experience for everyone involved.”
