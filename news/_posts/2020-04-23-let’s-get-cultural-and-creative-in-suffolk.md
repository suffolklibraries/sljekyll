A new online resource has been launched to make it easy for people to find quality online arts and culture experiences during the current lockdown. 

The new Let’s Get Cultural and Creative web directory is being hosted by Suffolk Libraries with the content coordinated by Suffolk County Council and local arts partner organisations.

The idea came from the ‘We are Ipswich’ cultural network of arts organisations to bring together the very best of what’s on offer online.  The directory includes a wide choice of links to local and national activities to enjoy including dance exercises from Dance East, Time Out’s virtual gallery tours, free National Theatre pieces and Red Rose Chain’s short films about real life Suffolk experiences.  

Several local organisations have been working together to develop the project including Suffolk Libraries, Suffolk County Council, the Association for Suffolk Museums and the We are Ipswich partnership which includes DanceEast, Eastern Angles, Gecko, New Wolsey Theatre, Pacitti Company (SPILL Festival), Red Rose Chain, Ipswich Museums and Ipswich Borough Council theatres (Ipswich Regent Theatre and Corn Exchange). 

Melissa Matthews, Creative Programmes Manager at Suffolk Libraries, said:

“There are so many wonderful online experiences which are being created across the country at the moment. It’s a really tough time for everyone but many organisations are working hard to focus their work online and provide new and accessible experiences for people to enjoy.  We hope this resource will offer another layer to Suffolk Libraries’ digital offers. Libraries have a really important role to play in helping people to find what they need and we hope the ‘Let’s get Cultural and Creative’ resource will help to point them in the direction of some excellent content.”

Councillor Paul West, Suffolk County Council Cabinet member for Communities, said:

“Arts and culture play a large role in our life and many of us are enjoying what they bring in these challenging times. Being able to deliver a range of activities and content for people of all ages across Suffolk to enjoy, despite being behind closed doors, is a fantastic initiative. Our arts and cultural organisations are incredibly talented and we hope that the Let's Get Cultural and Creative web directory will allow people to come together digitally to discuss and enjoy part of what makes Suffolk great.”

Ivan Cutting from the We are Ipswich partnership, said:

“We’ve had to get creative, but that’s in our blood. The launch of this what’s on guide demonstrates the breadth of theatres, museums and arts organisations, who can still look after people and bring them joy even when we’re all stuck at home. It is also important that people continue to support us so we are able to open our doors again in the future.”
