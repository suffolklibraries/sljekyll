Suffolk Libraries' latest statistics have revealed that the number of children taking part in the [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) this year has surpassed last year's total.

The scheme, which has a theme of Space Chase for 2019, celebrates 50 years since the moon landings and challenges children to read six books over the summer. As of Monday 19 August, 7,451 children had signed up for the challenge, with two weeks of the summer holidays still to go. This is an increase on last year's total of 7,420 sign-ups over the course of the scheme. Children taking part have also read nearly 16,000 books so far.

Krystal Vittles, head of service delivery, said: "The Summer Reading Challenge offers an encouraging way to keep children reading over the summer and have fun doing it. The Space Chase theme has been a huge success with families and this has clearly been reflected in the statistics this year. Don’t forget to keep reading though, the challenge isn’t over yet!"

There's still time to register for and complete the challenge at [your local library](/libraries/), as well as enter our [#SLWhereOnEarth](/news/sl-where-on-earth/) photo competition. If your child is successful in reading six books, they will be invited to a certificate and medal presentation at their library in the autumn.
