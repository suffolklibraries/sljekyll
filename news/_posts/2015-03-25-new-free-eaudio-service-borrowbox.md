We&#8217;re launching a new eAudio book service on 1 April to improve customers’ choice and enjoyment.

The new service is called BorrowBox and is provided by Suffolk Libraries’ current audio CD supplier. The company has exclusive rights to some major international authors including John le Carre, David Baldacci, Ian McEwan, Patrick Ness and Jacqueline Wilson so will give customers a broader range of authors and titles, for both adults and children.

The service will be accessible via the Suffolk Libraries website or by downloading the BorrowBox app to an Apple or Android device.

BorrowBox will replace the current OneClick Digital eAudio service but will run alongside the other eBook and eAudio service, Overdrive.

Customers will be able to borrow up to six eAudio books for up to 21 days. Anyone currently using the OneClick service will have to transfer over to the new service but any eAudio books due to expire after 1 April will be available until their original due date.

[See our eLibrary pages for help on using the service](/help/using-our-elibrary-service/).
