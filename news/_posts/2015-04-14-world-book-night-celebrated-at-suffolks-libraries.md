A series of events are taking place to mark World Book Night next week.

World Book Night is an annual celebration of reading and books that takes place on 23 April this year. The national campaign is organised by the Reading Agency with the aim of encouraging people who don’t read regularly or own books. Volunteers round the country give out hundreds of thousands of books in their communities to share their love of reading.
