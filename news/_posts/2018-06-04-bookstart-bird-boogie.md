This week (4 - 10 June) is National Bookstart Week. This year's theme is Bookstart Bird Boogie and libraries will be giving away free copies of the special BookTrust book [<cite>A Busy Day for Birds</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093926) by Lucy Cousins.

Parents can pick up copies of <cite>A Busy Day for Birds</cite> at all of our libraries' [regular Bookstart Baby Bounce and Tot Rock sessions](/events-activities/children/) to read with their children. It's a great book to read aloud - full of actions to do and noises to make - and it's guaranteed to get 0-5 year-olds boogieing!

Three libraries are running special Bookstart Bird Boogie events in addition to their regular children's sessions:

* [Bookstart event at Connect Mother and Toddler Group, hosted by Long Melford Library - Monday 4 June](/events/long-melford-2018-06-04-bookstart/)
* [Bookstart Bird Boogie at Chantry Library - Thursday 7 June](/events/chantry-2018-06-07-bookstart-bird-boogie/)
* [Bookstart Bird Boogie at Southwold Boating Lake and Tearoom, hosted by Southwold Library - Thursday 7 June, morning session](/events/southwold-2018-06-07-bird-boogie-am/)
* [Bookstart Bird Boogie at Southwold Boating Lake and Tearoom, hosted by Southwold Library - Thursday 7 June, afternoon session](/events/southwold-2018-06-07-bird-boogie-pm/)

National Bookstart Week is BookTrust's annual celebration of the joys and benefits of sharing books, stories and rhymes from as early an age as possible. Each year, BookTrust chooses a theme for Bookstart week to get families involved in fun, themed events across the country at libraries, childrenâ€™s centres, bookshops and other settings, where they can share fantastic free books and activities with their babies and young children.
