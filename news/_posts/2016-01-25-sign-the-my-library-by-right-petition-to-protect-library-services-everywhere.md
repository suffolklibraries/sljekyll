The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) is asking library users everywhere to show their support for a campaign which reminds everyone that public libraries are a statutory service.

Many library services have had to reduce opening hours, close library buildings and make library staff redundant.

Here in Suffolk we have managed to avoid all of these, and strengthen what our libraries offer, with our expert staff and our 44 community groups.

If you would like to show your support for what we have and how you feel about public libraries everywhere, please [sign the petition](http://www.cilip.org.uk/advocacy-campaigns-awards/advocacy-campaigns/my-library-right).
