Lowestoft Library Pages cafe will close on December 24.

We have tried various initiatives to improve the fortunes of the café as it hasn’t been attracting enough customers to cover its costs.

Given the increasing funding pressures that Suffolk Libraries is under, we are unable to justify continuing to subsidise it.

No plans have yet been agreed as to what the space will be used for once the café is closed. We will be exploring options early in 2016.
