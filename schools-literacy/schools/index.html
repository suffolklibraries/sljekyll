<h2>Supporting reading for pleasure in schools</h2>

The Literacy, Books and Reading Team for Schools is replacing the Schools Library Service. We support your students' reading for pleasure through resource loans and expert advice.

We offer a fully supported service where we choose resources for you, or you can choose your own resources with our self-service option.
