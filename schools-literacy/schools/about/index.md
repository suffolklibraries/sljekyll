The Literacy, Books and Reading Team for Schools, (previously known as the Schools Library Service) helps improve literacy in schools, through promoting reading for pleasure and supporting the curriculum using specialist knowledge about books.

Our advisory librarians have over 80 years experience and provide advice and support to teachers and school libraries. We also offer diverse collections of books and artefacts to support classroom topics, ranging from the Romans to modern Indian culture.

We provide better value and more choice for schools by providing a menu based service so schools have the freedom to buy only what they need. You can also opt for a cheaper and more flexible seIf-service option which enables teachers or school staff to choose and borrow books from their nearest library.

For more info call **01473 263800** or email **schools@suffolklibraries.co.uk** for an informal discussion about the service.
