Our libraries are family friendly places that offer free internet use and wifi.

All our libraries run the national <a href="http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/">Summer Reading Challenge</a> every year, in which teenagers can volunteer to hear younger children read and talk to them about their book choices. This volunteering can count towards a Duke of Edinburgh award.

Teenagers can have their own library card and borrow books for free.
<h2>What we stock</h2>
We have a wide range of physical books and <a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/">eBooks</a> for teenagers to read. In future, Young Adult books will be shelved with Adult fiction.
