Our libraries are family friendly places that offer free internet use and wifi.

All our libraries run <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/childrens-events-activities">activities for children</a> of all ages, including craft sessions, story times and author visits. We also run the national <a href="http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/">Summer Reading Challenge</a> every year.

Children can have their own library card and borrow books for free.
<h2>What we stock</h2>
We arrange children’s books to match with the way your child learns.

<strong>We don’t stock reading schemes</strong>. Instead, we buy as wide a range of other books as we can that will support your child’s reading at school. These include:

<h2>Using the library to improve your child’s reading skills</h2>
You can help your children by bringing them to the library to choose books.

We stock thousands of books for all levels:
<ul>
	<li>When they’ve just learnt a few letter sounds</li>
	<li>When they’re beginning to read with some support</li>
	<li>When they can read short sentences</li>
	<li>When they’re independent readers</li>
</ul>
You can be a reading role-model for children. As well as reading imaginative books to and with them, you can ask them to:
<ul>
	<li>read the recipes for you when you cook</li>
	<li>read out a shopping list when you go round the supermarket</li>
	<li>read road signs, labels and instructions or the TV guide</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the library to help your child’s emotional development</h2>
Children who read for pleasure do better at school. Before you even get to the educational stuff like increasing vocabulary and phonic awareness, you can also help nurture a child’s emotional development, self-esteem and capacity to empathise with others.
