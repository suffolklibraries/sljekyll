## Helping your baby or toddler to enjoy reading and prepare for them for school

Your child will enjoy regular access to books, which will help them become a enthusiastic reader.

When you read with your child set aside some quiet time. Sit close, smile and use funny voices.

Encourage your child to look carefully at the pictures. Talk about the story: ask them about what they think will happen next and explain the characters’ actions.

Reading with your child will improve their attention span and listening skills. This will help them when they learn to read at school.

Babies and toddlers feel safe within established routines and rituals. A bedtime story is the perfect end to their day. Recent research shows that [babies learn most just before they sleep](http://qz.com/325823/researchers-say-babies-learn-better-before-sleep/).

Your child will often want to borrow the same book several times. Choosing their own books and showing a preference for a particular story is the beginning of their lifelong journey as a reader.
