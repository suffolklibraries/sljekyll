Dear wonderful educational worker,

Welcome to 'Beyond the Book' - a totally free programme promoting reading for pleasure for year 7 pupils in Suffolk. Every pupil will receive a free activity booklet and a new library card that is exclusive to year 7. We are also providing resources for teaching staff to use in tutor time and classes throughout the year.

## Books are just the beginning…

Libraries play a key role in the development of a child. We have our core offer of books that are free to borrow from any of our 44 libraries. But did you know we have 3D printers, book groups, free wifi in every branch, [Minecraft installed on every computer and a Minecraft server](/blog/minecraft-and-childrens-lan-parties-at-thurston-library/), 'chat and chill' sessions for ESOL families, dual language books, [a mental health and well being service](/health/), [a specialised Music &amp; Drama library](/music-and-drama/), and much more. We offer a comprehensive service that can support your young people and their families. Just think of the S.M.S.C. opportunities available and how we can show these off to Ofsted!

More details about Beyond the Book are below, but use the [contact us](/schools-literacy/literacy/contact/) page to get in touch and discuss your needs.

'Beyond the Book' is aimed at year 7 pupils, but we are keen to engage with all year groups so do please get in touch and we will see how we can help.
