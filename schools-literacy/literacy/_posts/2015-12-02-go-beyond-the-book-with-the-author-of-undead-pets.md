Buddy the Budgie is dead. [He&#8217;s kicked the bucket, he&#8217;s shuffled off this mortal coil.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj8RIEQH7zA)

But Buddy has one last job to do before he passes on to the big bird table in the sky &#8211; and only 10 year Joe Edwards can help him. Joe is a ‘Protector of Undead Pets’ thanks to the ancient Egyptian amulet given to him by his great-uncle. This means that he must help recently deceased zombie pets to pass on into the afterlife! <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17108133?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(24548218)&QRYTEXT=Flight%20of%20the%20battered%20budgie">Flight of the Battered Budgie</a> </cite>finds Joe helping the rather pesky (and did we mention very dead) Buddy save his former owner from being robbed.

Joe has far more patience than me when it comes to helping the zombie animals, as Buddy the Budgie gets him into some right pickles. The characters in the book are all wonderfully written with the wicked dinner lady sisters an evil joy to read. And Joe is a real star who never gives up trying to help everyone around him – he is a sort of modern day Charlie Bucket mixed with a bit of Alex Rider.<figure>

Author [Sam Hay](http://samhayauthor.com/) has created a really original, funny and interesting series with [<cite>Undead Pets</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17108607?QRY=SEBIB%3C%20IRN(13318672)&QRYTEXT=Undead%20pets), and the books really come alive(!) through the illustrations of [Simon Cooper](http://www.littletiger.co.uk/authors/simon-cooper). This is a great series for children and I think the books would be brilliant to read out to a whole class.

We asked Sam Hay to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and answer a few questions about her life as an author. She said yes and recommends some excellent books to check out!

&nbsp;

### Hello there, where in the world are you today?

Hi! I’m at home in South Wales. It’s a bit damp and grey.

### What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)

My desk is in a cupboard in the corner of the dining room, so I don’t really have a view. But if I turn around and look out of the dining room window this is my view; our back garden. It’s long and thin and slightly wild with lots of old trees which rustle in the wind.<figure>

### How many words have you written today? (be honest!)

Not many yet. But I’ve just jotted down a conversation I’ve had swirling around in my head for a new project I’m working on. I do a lot of thinking about writing rather than actual writing. Unless I have a deadline &#8211; then I work fast. Before I started writing books I was a journalist. Deadlines were very important. I am much more productive if I have a tight deadline.

### What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)

I’ve just bought [Anthony Horowitz](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17107494?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(44493)&QRYTEXT=Horowitz%2C%20Anthony)’s. I like all sort of genres &#8211; adventure, history, gothic suspense, spy stories. I love picture books, too. My son and I have just read <cite>When the Crayons Came Home</cite> by Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffers. We liked it so much we will probably read it again tonight, and tomorrow night and the one after that&#8230;

### If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?

<cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17134607?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(14326)&QRYTEXT=Animal%20farm">Animal Farm</a></cite> by George Orwell. I’d like to rescue Boxer and warn the animals about the pigs! I’d also quite like to spend an afternoon in [<cite>The Wind in the Willows</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17135255?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(6572)&QRYTEXT=The%20wind%20in%20the%20willows) picnicking with Rattie and Mole. And I’d definitely like to pass through the wardrobe into Narnia and have a snowy supper with Mr Tumnus and help sort out that witch.

### It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?

I have a feeling that all our electronic gadgetry will eventually go pop and the world may regress to something like the Victorian age where we’ll all be reading traditional books by candlelight around the fire. I quite like the sound of that.

### We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?

I think I might send them <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17118589?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(291868)&QRYTEXT=The%20one%20and%20only%20Ivan">The One and Only Ivan</a></cite> by Katherine Applegate. The story is told from the point of view of a captive gorilla and it has a lot of wise words about humans. It’s a bit sad though, so I might swap it for an old favourite <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17119553?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(6402)&QRYTEXT=Charlie%20and%20the%20chocolate%20factory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></cite> by Roald Dahl. It’s darkly funny, moral and full of sweets &#8211; all things I love! Maybe the aliens would love it, too.

Thanks for going &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217;, Sam Hay!<figure>
