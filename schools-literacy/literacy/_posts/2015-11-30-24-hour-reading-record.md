I was fortunate to attend a conference last week held by the fabulous [Norfolk Children&#8217;s Book Centre](http://www.ncbc.co.uk/new/index.html). It was a great day with some inspirational speakers sharing great ideas for creating reading communities, holding story cafes, becoming a reading teacher and promoting reading to young people.

Over the coming weeks I will share some of the ideas, along with practical ideas on how to implement them in schools and at home.

The first one I&#8217;m going to mention is &#8216;keeping a 24 hour reading log&#8217; which can be used as a way to explore the text we experience in everyday life. It also raises the point that non-fiction and non-printed materials play a considerable role in the &#8216;reading for pleasure&#8217; of young people.

The 24 hour activity is as simple as it sounds &#8211; all you need do is record EVERYTHING you read throughout the day. I recorded all the text I encountered on Saturday 28 November 2016. It was a pretty routine day that included a shopping trip to Ipswich.

## Waking up to Breakfast:

15 (ish) emails, scrolled through twitter for a bit probably scanning 100+ tweets, checked the headlines on the Guardian.

## Breakfast to Lunch:

Bacon packet, dates on eggs, station on digital radio, googled local butcher, red aloud [<cite>The Dot</cite> by Peter H. Reynolds](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15862876?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(702721)&QRYTEXT=The%20dot) to my wife (who agreed it was brilliant!), shopping list on &#8216;notes&#8217; app, googled address of Halfords, turkey poster in butchers, car park charges, details about [Ancient House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_House,_Ipswich), Debenhams floor information, street signs, coffee menu, football scores on app, vinyl records, cd tracklisting, various shop signs, newspaper headlines, Christmas card packs.

## Lunch to Evening Meal:

Football results on TV, [<cite>A boy called Christmas</cite> by Matt Haig](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15865288?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(54807791)&QRYTEXT=A%20boy%20called%20Christmas) (36 pages), crossword clues, Saturday newspaper magazine, washing instructions on dog bed, pasta cooking instructions.

## Evening Meal to Bedtime:

Two episodes of <cite>The Bridge</cite> (subtitles), Wikipedia, google, WhatsApp message, eBay listings, iMessage, All4 app.

That&#8217;s quite a diverse range of reading.

## How can you use it in school?

We have created a [24 Hour Reading Diary](/assets/pdf/beyond-the-book-24-hour-reading-diary.pdf) for you to complete with your class as homework. Get the whole school to complete it. The results will help everyone think about the range of things they read. Young people and adults/staff could compare results &#8211; are there any similarities or surprises? It could also a powerful tool to use with &#8216;non-readers&#8217; who claim they don&#8217;t read anything. Pupils could create posters  which could be used for display work and assemblies.

Most importantly it will give adults an insight into what young people like reading and allow them to expand what materials they have in classrooms and homes.
