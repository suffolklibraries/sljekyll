Can you guess the title of the book from the emoji symbols shown above? What could a question mark, a train, another train and a dragon signify?

The humble emoji was named as the [Oxford Dictionaries word of the year for 2015](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/11/word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/), which is quite an achievement for a pictograph.

Inspired by the [Christmas Emoji Book Quiz](http://www.thebookseller.com/insight/name-book-emoji-special-318808) created by the Bookseller in December, I decided to have a go at creating a set of emoji book titles specifically for children&#8217;s literature. Not only are they fun (and at times infuriating!) but they introduce quality books and authors to those who take part.

### There are two resources:

  * A short <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Emoji-Quiz.pdf" rel="">15 question Emoji Quiz sheet</a> that could be used as a starter or in a library quiz, or at an all staff CPD/INSET session to test staff knowledge on children&#8217;s literature! [Answers](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Emoji-Quiz-Answers.pdf) are on a separate sheet.
  * A longer [PowerPoint presentation](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Emoji-Book-Quiz.pptx) that could be put on a loop in reception areas and libraries, or chopped up and used as a starter activity.

Pupils could then try to create their own representations of book titles by [downloading the emoji symbols](http://emojipedia.org/apple/).

Have fun and let us know how you got on in the comments section!<figure>
