[Shakespeare Week](http://shakespeareweek.org.uk/) runs from 14-20 March 2016 and is a national annual celebration giving primary school children a chance to learn more about [William Shakespeare](/new-suggestions/fiction/william-shakespeare-celebrating-his-400th-anniversary).

This reminded me of a fun activity I ran a few years ago which encouraged Key Stage 3 pupils to create their own Shakespearean insults!

Using the [Shakespeare Insult Generator](/assets/ppt/beyond-the-book-shakespeare-insult-generator.pptx) pupils start a sentence with &#8216;thou&#8217; then add a word from the following three slides until they have a assembled a cutting Elizabethan insult such as _&#8216;thou droning, pox marked, flap-dragon&#8217;_!

This was a fun starter and also we ran a competition for the funniest combination of insults.

What are you waiting for thou infectious, half-faced, foot-licker! Get cracking!
