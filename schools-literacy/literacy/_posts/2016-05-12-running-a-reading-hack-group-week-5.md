![Reading Hack Group - Week 5](/images/featured/featured-reading-hack-week-5.jpg)

This is a series of blog posts explaining how we are running a new Reading Hack group, which might be useful for those thinking of starting a group of their own.

In [week 1](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-1) we looked at introducing [Reading Hack](http://readinghack.org.uk/) to a small group of year 7 pupils and took part in a #BookFace Hack. In [week 2](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-2) we created our online group, user accounts and took part in some other Hacks. In [week 3](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-3) we transported ourselves into strange bookish worlds using green screen technology. In [week 4](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-4) we started to plan our own Hacks and trained to be librarians.

## Week 5

This week the Hackers were going to get poetic. I had been keen to do some 'cut-ups' and blackout poetry for a while, and had suggested this to our Hackers who responded enthusiastically. Ellen McAteer, library manager at Beccles, has strong links with [The Poetry Trust](http://www.thepoetrytrust.org/) and suggested I checked out their fantastic [<cite>The Poetry Toolkit: fool proof recipes for teaching poetry in the classroom</cite>](http://www.thepoetrytrust.org/poetry_toolkit/) for some ideas.

Staff at Beccles library collected some withdrawn books for the [blackout poetry](http://readinghack.org.uk/hacks/184) and I adapted the [Poetry Jigsaw](http://readinghack.org.uk/hacks/183) activity from the toolkit. I added both Hacks to the Reading Hack website in advance by adapting a Hack design already available.

We started with the poetry jigsaw Hack which involves cutting the text of a poem up and rearranging it. The idea is not to reconstruct the original poem, but to use the original poet’s material to create something new.

I had cut up [<cite>The Seagulls Think We Live at the Seaside</cite>](http://www.michaelrosen.co.uk/seaside.html) by the wonderful Michael Rosen in advance. I chose this poem as I felt it was about the right length and has some brilliant words and phrases in it.

>The seagulls think we live at the seaside:<br>
the tower blocks are their cliffs,<br>
they swoop for fish in the gutter<br>
but happy that it’s last night’s fried rice.<br>
They stand about talking on the pavement beach<br>
and ride the sea-breezes pumped out by the cinema air-conditioning.<br>
They hover over the waves of cars<br>
and if you stare at them<br>
wondering what they’re doing so far from home<br>
they stare back:<br>
“This is our home now.<br>
That kebab<br>
Is a crab.”<br>

I decided to cut the poem up in three ways for a bit of differentiation: for one set I left some phrases together, one set had some phrases and individual words and one set was every individual word cut up. Hackers would choose their difficulty level and work in pairs to rearrange the words of the poem to create something new. Crucially, the Hackers would only be hear the original poem after they had finished their own!

The Hackers got stuck in and seemed to enjoy putting random words together! Once they were happy with their rearranging they glued the words down. We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mjes/status/730397252984963072") our finished work to Michael Rosen asking for his opinion – he hasn’t responded yet…! One Hacker used my iPad to play us some other Michael Rosen poems whilst we worked. Great fun!

Next we moved onto blackout poetry. The Hackers were really nervous about ripping pages out of old books!

Each Hacker approached the Hack in a different way – some went totally [William Burroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc2yU7OUMcI) by blacking out words totally randomly, one erased all the words starting with a vowel and one photocopied a page from a Percy Jackson book and Hacked that. I will get some cheap picture frames this week for those wanting to display their blackouts as art.

Next week I am not providing any activities. The group have all been working on their own Hacks to share with each other. There will be Gandalf’s social media experiment, literary Christmas carols, create a Percy Jackson weapon and a top secret Hack involving hair… I can’t wait!

## Hints and Tips

**Resources:** The Poetry Toolkit from The Poetry Trust is full of brilliant activities for all ages and abilities. I intend to use it again outside of Reading Hack sessions.

**Making a mess:** If you use permanent markers for the blackout poetry, make sure that there is something for people to lean on. The ink ran through the pages and all over the tables!
