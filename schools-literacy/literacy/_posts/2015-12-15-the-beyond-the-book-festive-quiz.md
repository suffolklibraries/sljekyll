Here at <cite>Beyond the Book</cite>, we love both the festive period and a good quiz. At a recent management forum we took part in a fiendishly difficult Christmas movie quiz and each year I do battle with my mother-in-law over the King William&#8217;s College general knowledge quiz — surely the quiz of all quizzes!

Pupils attending King William&#8217;s College have been teased by this cryptic [general knowledge quiz](http://www.kwc.im/general-knowledge-quiz) since 1905. The average score was two correct answers. That&#8217;s right, two. Out of a hundred and eighty. If you think you can score more than that, the questions are published on the [college website](http://www.kwc.im/general-knowledge-quiz) on Christmas Eve and also on the [Guardian website.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/king-william-s-college-quiz) The answers are not revealed until February!

### The &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; Festive Quiz!

We have put together 15 questions that are a little less cryptic, but hopefully a lot of fun for both young and old. Below you will find PowerPoint versions of our festive quiz that could be used in secondary schools, offices and alike. There is also a pdf version. Good luck!
