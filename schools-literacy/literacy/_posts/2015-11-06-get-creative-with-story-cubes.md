![Rory’s Story Cubes](/images/featured/featured-rorys-story-cubes.jpg)

Whilst in Waterstones I picked up a great storytelling idea – Rory’s Story Cubes.

These are 9 cubes with a different symbol on each side. You simply roll the cubes out, see what random symbols you get and start storytelling! This looked like an ingenious way to get a little help when creating a story.

I rolled mine out and this is what I got:

So it looks like I have to tell a story about someone learning something, a house, a tortoise, a lock, Earth, an alien, a fountain, a castle and the moon&#8230; Let&#8217;s have a go.

_Gordon was **learning** to drive and waiting for his driving instructor to arrive. Soon enough he heard the distant rumble of an exhaust followed by a screech of tyres outside his **house**. Gordon jumped up from the sofa and sprinted to the front door narrowly avoiding tripping up over his pet **tortoise** Hurricane. Gordon scolded Hurricane for always being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hurricane didn&#8217;t look bothered. Gordon grabbed his keys, slipped them into the **lock**, opened the door and walked out into the November drizzle._

_Gordon sensed that something was not quite right. There was a distinct hissing and squealing sound coming from beyond the hedge. It was if the **Earth** had been taken over by a race of slithering **Aliens**. And there was no sign of his driving instructor. Tentatively, Gordon walked to the end of his garden path and peered down the road. What he saw did not please him. Where once an ornamental **fountain **had stood, complete with a scale replica of Orford **Castle**, was now home to a mangle of twisted metal, sparks and steam. Bending down Gordon retrieved a triangular plastic sign that read &#8216;ACE driving school. We will drive you to the **moon** and back.&#8217;_

_&#8216;Fat chance of that&#8217; thought Gordon as he turned for home._

What do you think! Pretty good? I used the cubes in the order they were rolled but you could mix them up in any way you want or take a couple out to make it easier. There are also other packs of cubes available such as Batman, enchanted tales and sport. You could mix them all up.

There is also a cheaper way of making your own by using a die from any board game and [Our Story Cube Starter](/assets/pdf/beyond-the-book-story-cube.pdf).

**Get rewarded for your work**

Why not use either approach to enter the [East Anglian Daily Times Suffolk children&#8217;s short story competition](http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/write-now)?

There are two age groups: 5-7 year olds and 8-11 year olds (pick the age you are on October 3, 2015).

They are looking for an original piece of fiction, no more than 500 words long, written by you, which they will publish in the East Anglian Daily Times.

The story will also be read out on air on Lesley Dolphin’s afternoon show by one of the judges and the winners will be interviewed by Lesley.

There is also a prize of £50 of book tokens for both age groups.

All stories must be your own original work and will be submitted by an adult. You can email your story to Liz Nice at **liz.nice@archant.co.uk** or Lesley Dolphin at **lesley.dolphin@bbc.co.uk**.
