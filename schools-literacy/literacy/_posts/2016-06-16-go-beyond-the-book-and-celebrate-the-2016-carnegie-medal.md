The crowning of the [2016 CILIP Carnegie Medal](http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/) winner on Monday 20 June will be a massive day in the literacy calendar. The CILIP Carnegie and Kate Greenaway (for an outstanding illustration) Medals are the UK's oldest and most prestigious children's book awards. For those authors shortlisted it is 'the one they want to win' indicating that their work is the gold standard in children's literature. Those shortlisted for the Carnegie this year are as follows:

The process is judged solely by librarians, but thousands of children and young people have been reading the books and selecting their own winner in schools and public libraries across the country. The roll-call of past winners includes: Arthur Ransome, C.S. Lewis, Terry Pratchett, Philip Pullman, Anne Fine, Sally Gardner, Beverley Naidoo and Neil Gaiman. I think my favourite was the 2008 medal winner Siobhan Dowd for [<cite>Bog Child</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15811341?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(114192)&QRYTEXT=Bog%20child) which explores the human side of political conflict from the perspective of young people on the Northern Irish border in the early 1980s. Beautifully written, poignant, informative and totally engaging.

The 2015 Carnegie Medal winner was Tanya Landman for the mesmerising [<cite>Buffalo Soldier</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15812035?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(200932)&QRYTEXT=Buffalo%20soldier). I [reviewed <cite>Buffalo Soldier</cite> back in November](/schools-literacy/literacy/buffalo-soldier-by-tanya-landman), and dipped back into the story over the weekend. The power of the narrative has not diminished.

We asked Tanya Landman to go Beyond the Book with us and she said yes! Tanya is also appearing at the [Felixstowe Book Festival](http://felixstowebookfestival.co.uk/events/43) on 25 June. Speaking from Personal experience, her events are brilliant so I encourage you go along!

**Hello there, where in the world are you today?**

At my desk at home in Bideford, Devon.

**What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)**

![Tanya Landman's lounge](/images/article/tanya-landman-window.jpg)

The conservatory and the back garden – looking very grey and gloomy!

**How many words have you written today?**

Not as many as I want!

**What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)**

This lot.  

![Tanya Landman's shelfie](/images/article/tanya-landman-shelfie.jpg)

And there's another massive pile by the bed. So many books… so little time to read!!!

**If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?**

I would love to be Barney in Stig of the Dump of that magical Midsummer evening. I wouldn't change a thing.

**It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?**

People have been reading and telling stories to each other since they first evolved.  I suspect we'll still be doing it in 2015.

**We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?**

A terrible cliché, I'm afraid (but clichés are clichés because they're often true ) –  a volume of Shakespeare's plays. No one sums up the human condition better than him.
