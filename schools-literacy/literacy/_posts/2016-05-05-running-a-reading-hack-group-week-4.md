![Reading Hack Group - Week 4](/images/featured/featured-reading-hack-week-4.jpg)

This is a series of blog posts explaining how we are running a new Reading Hack group, which might be useful for those thinking of starting a group of their own.

In [week 1](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-1) we looked at introducing [Reading Hack](http://readinghack.org.uk/) to a small group of year 7 pupils and took part in a #BookFace Hack. In [week 2](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-2) we created our online group, user accounts and took part in some other Hacks. In [week 3](/schools-literacy/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-3) we transported ourselves into strange bookish worlds using green screen technology.

## Week 4

This week the [Beccles Book Bunnies](http://readinghack.org.uk/groups/23) were going to train as librarians. The pupils had requested to do this during our first session as they were keen to help the public and learn about library duties.

A member of Beccles library staff came and spoke to the group and explained what they would be doing and the importance of data protection etc. Half the group left to work on the library floor and were soon shelving books, shelf checking and assisting customers. The other half of the group stayed with me to start planning a Hack of their own.

So far the year 7 pupils have loved the different Hacks we have tried, but have struggled to come up with solid ideas of their own. Using a [Hack planning sheet](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Create-your-own-Hack.docx) I had adapted from the official ‘[Getting Started](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tra-hack/uploads/toolkit/attachment/3/1._Getting_Started.pdf)’ toolkit, pupils listed 10 things that interest them and 10 activities they like taking part in. They then used part 2 of the Hack planning sheet to rank their likes by writing their interests and activities closer or further away from the heart. This should then help them to create a Hack that will appeal to them, is a little outside of the box and a bit random.

Interestingly, this did not always produce an amazing idea that really stood out. As you can see from the picture at the top of this blog post, this Hacker loves LOTR and reading so these would feature in her Hack. But how? Thankfully, what happened was that the other Hackers soon started chipping in by swapping ideas and discussing the Hacks they had completed in previous sessions. They were Hacking my Hacks!

Our LOTR fan had loved the green screen activity and was a keen Instagram user. What if Gandalf had an Instagram account and posted selfies of himself in various ‘normal’ situations like on the beach or going out on a date? Now we were rocking, and the group could start to write their ideas down. One Hacker cut up her ideas and put them into a hat to make the pairings totally random. This produced some unexpected results: anyone for a horror themed drama piece about pizza?!

I will pull together the resources pupils need for the Hacks, and we will get started on them over the next two sessions. Alongside #InstagramGandalf there will be fantastic recipe books for Percy Jackson and Katniss Everdeen fans!

The two groups swapped over so everyone had the chance to try being a librarian and planning their Hacks. Library staff at Beccles were really pleased with the work the pupils did, and have invited them to try some advanced library duties over the coming weeks. Result!

## Hints and Tips

Get random: The ‘[Getting Started](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tra-hack/uploads/toolkit/attachment/3/1._Getting_Started.pdf)’ [toolkit activity](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Create-your-own-Hack.docx) that I adapted did work once the group started sharing ideas. Next time I will try pupils writing their interests onto post it notes and use one A3 sized heart sheet. Hackers will then mix their ideas up as a group.
