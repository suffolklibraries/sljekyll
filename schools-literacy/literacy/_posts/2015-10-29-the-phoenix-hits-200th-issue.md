<cite>The Phoenix</cite> is a weekly 32-page comic for children aged 6 – 12 and features seven or more exciting story strips, a puzzle competition and a new non-fiction strip every week of the year. On Friday 30 October the <cite>Phoenix</cite> is celebrating its 200th issue; the first independent UK comic since 1969 to do so!

## Activities to try:

There is a brilliant [activities section on the Phoenix website](http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/category/masterclass/) packed with competitions and creative stuff for kids to do. They also encourage kids to send their own comics in for them to read! You can learn to draw my favourite character Evil Emperor Penguin (and his minion Eugene) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/oct/17/how-to-draw-an-evil-penguin-laura-ellen-anderson">here on the Guardian website</a>.
