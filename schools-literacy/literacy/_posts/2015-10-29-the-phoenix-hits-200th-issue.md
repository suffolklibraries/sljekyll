**Activities to try:**

There is a brilliant [activities section on the Phoenix website](http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/category/masterclass/) packed with competitions and creative stuff for kids to do. They also encourage kids to send their own comics in for them to read! You can learn to draw my favourite character Evil Emperor Penguin (and his minion Eugene) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/oct/17/how-to-draw-an-evil-penguin-laura-ellen-anderson" target="_blank">here on the Guardian website</a>.
