23 to 29 November 2015 is [Book Week Scotland](http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/book-week-scotland) &#8211; Scotland&#8217;s annual celebration of books & reading. They have some really interesting stuff going on – and just because we are south of the border doesn’t mean we can’t get involved!

## Read Instead – Find some time to read during the day.

Think you don’t have time for reading? Think again! [Book Week Scotland have devised a cunning test](http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/reading/book-week-scotland/how-much-could-you-read-instead) will reveal how much extra reading time you can find in the day. Now, I read for pleasure every day (normally at least an hour before bed). I took the challenge and got some surprising results.

How it works – first I entered the average times I spend doing the following activities on an average day.<figure>

I hit the calculate button to find out what extra reading I could be squeezing in. I got the following&#8230;<figure>

By faffing on my phone and watching the dreary adverts on 4oD during Peep Show I am missing out annually on five and a half million words a year! And how did it know that I am yet to tackle the [<cite>The Odyssey</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13079486?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51449)&QRYTEXT=The%20Odyssey)&#8230;

The test is only a bit of fun but it could be a great eye-opener for proving to someone that they do indeed have time to read. I loved that the results even give you book titles it thinks you could read. The recommendations are genuinely different every time [so why not give it a try yourself](http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/reading/book-week-scotland/how-much-could-you-read-instead). **Teachers &#8211; you could use it during an assembly to raise awareness.**

## Journeys: Get the Book!

There is also a [free eBook to download](http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/reading/book-week-scotland/journeys-get-the-book) with stories based around taking a journey. I have downloaded a copy already and intend to read as many of the collected stories as I can in all the spare time created using the test above&#8230;<figure>

> Intrepid storytellers from across Scotland share the journeys that mean the most to them – whether that’s a trip around the world or a visit to a precious moment in the past. Leave your suitcase at home, let your imagination do the travelling for you and dip into tales of stunning landscapes, misadventures, relocations and relationships.

> With stories from the Scottish public plus well-known writers including Andrew O’Hagan, Jenni Fagan and Lucy Ribchester, this is a book that will take you places.

Happy Book Week Scotland &#8211; and well done for some great reading ideas.
