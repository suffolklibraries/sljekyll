This is a series of blog posts explaining how we are running a new Reading Hack group, which might be useful for those thinking of starting a group of their own. In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-1">week 1</a> we looked at introducing Reading Hack to a small group of year 7 pupils and completed a #BookFace Hack. In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-2">week 2</a> we created our online group, user accounts and took part in some other Hacks.
<h3>Week 3</h3>
We again began by looking at the response to our <a href="https://twitter.com/mjes/status/722798489684545536">tweets </a>sent out last week. The pupils really love the attention! Then we played a game of <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-Trump-Hack.docx">Top Trumps</a> with the <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-Trumps-Template-final.docx">set </a>we created last week which was great fun, and involved some interesting discussions on the various traits of different characters. Is Gandalf really more cunning than Percy Jackson?

The Hack planned for today was a ‘<a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Green-Screen-Hack.docx">Green Screen Hack</a>’ which involved the pupils using a green screen and iPad to transport themselves into various ‘bookish’ movie scenes.

I showed them the Hack and let them get on with it. They were quick to pick up on how to make the app work and enjoyed posing in front of the screen.

He wanted to make sure that the activity counter on his profile had caught up to that of the other members.

&nbsp;

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Almost everyone had accessed the </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://readinghack.org.uk/groups/23">Reading Hack website</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> since our session last week to update their profiles. Getting them to create and add Hacks to the website is the next challenge.</span>

For the final 10 minutes pupils started to think about planning their own Hack using an adapted activity in the ‘<a href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tra-hack/uploads/toolkit/attachment/3/1._Getting_Started.pdf">Getting Started</a>’ toolkit. We quickly ran out of time for this so pupils have taken home the sheet to complete by listing 10 ‘things’ they like (My Little Pony, LOTR, etc.) and 10 activities they enjoy (walking, ice hockey, etc.). In the next session we will mash-up their ideas!

Next week the Hackers are becoming junior librarians. This will involve library staff showing them the dark art of librarianship and how to help customers. They are very excited!
<h3>Hints and Tips.</h3>
<strong>Cost:</strong> The ‘<a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Green-Screen-Hack.docx">Green Screen Hack</a>’ is great fun and easy to do, but does require some resources (iPad/iPhone, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/green-screen-by-do-ink/id730091131?mt=8">the £3.99 app</a> and a £5 sheet of green screen material). It is great for working in pairs, but you need other activities to be available to stop other pupils becoming disengaged.
<h3>Lessons learnt from this week</h3>
<strong>Time keeping: </strong>I failed this week to get everything in! However, the pupils are starting to take ownership of the group and understand how Reading Hack works after three sessions. The pupils are more than happy to go back to Hacks from previous sessions so keep these handy. Pupils have also all updated their library accounts and borrowed books.
