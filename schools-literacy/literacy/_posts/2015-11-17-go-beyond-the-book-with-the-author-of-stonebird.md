<cite>Stonebird</cite> was thrust into my hands in Felixstowe back in September by an enthusiastic librarian (is there any other kind…?). Within five minutes of starting it I was hooked. When I closed the cover for the final time a day later my head had a nice swirly feeling and I am sure I radiated a warm glow that could be seen.

Author Mike Revell weaves a magic story about the magic of telling stories. Eleven year old Liam has moved house and school to be closer to his maternal Grandma. She is in a care home suffering with dementia – which Liam mishears as &#8220;she has a demon in her&#8221; eating away at her memory. During one unhappy visit, Grandma screams out that she has killed someone and will kill again. Will finding grandma’s teenage diary give him the answers he needs or open a whole new fantastical can of worms? And does the magical egg handed round during circle time really control a guardian angel that will protect him from the school bullies?

<cite>Stonebird</cite> is a wonderful novel that crams so much in to its mere three hundred pages. It offers a tender introduction to dementia, a child’s perspective on family break-up, opens up the human impact of war to a young audience and stimulates the power of imagination. It will keep boys and girls and parents and grandparents and anyone who picks it up enthralled. And if you don’t feel that warm glow at the end, maybe you need the Stonebird.

We asked Mike Revell to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and answer a few questions about his life as an author.

**Hello there, where in the world are you today?**

I&#8217;m in a cafe in Caernarfon, inside the walls of the castle.

**What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)**

I&#8217;ve got a great view of the castle &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty inspiring!<figure class="figure aligncenter">

**How many words have you written today? (be honest!)**

Only 250 words so far, but it&#8217;s 9:30 as I talk to you, so there&#8217;s plenty of time left to try to get the words flowing.

**What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)**

I&#8217;m reading _[The Wolf Wilder](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9178994?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51021646)&QRYTEXT=The%20wolf%20wilder)_ at the moment (it&#8217;s beautiful!), and my bookshelf is filled with plenty of children&#8217;s books to get round to.<figure class="figure aligncenter">

**If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?**

Harry Potter for sure. I don&#8217;t know how much I&#8217;d be able to change, but I&#8217;d probably want in on Fred and George&#8217;s sweet shop! All the sweets sound delicious in the books, so I can only imagine how bonkers and brilliant they&#8217;d be in real life.

**It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?**

I think by then then iPhone would become the mePhone, and you will read either through glasses, contact lenses or on the palm of your hand. But even then, there will still be physical books. Neil Gaiman once said &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming" target="_blank">Books are like sharks</a>.&#8221; Sharks were around before dinosaurs, but they&#8217;re still there now, because there&#8217;s nothing better at being a shark than a shark.

**We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?**

Hmm&#8230; great question! Possibly _[Catcher in the Rye](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9179642?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(564250)&QRYTEXT=The%20catcher%20in%20the%20rye)_. I think it would give the aliens a chuckle, but show them something about our heart as well.

Thanks for going &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; Mike Revell!
