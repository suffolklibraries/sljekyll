This is a series of blog posts explaining how we are running a new Reading Hack group, which might be useful for those thinking of starting a group of their own.

In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-1">week 1</a> we looked at introducing <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/">Reading Hack</a> to a small group of year 7 pupils and took part in a #BookFace Hack. In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-2">week 2</a> we created our online group, user accounts and took part in some other Hacks. In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-3">week 3</a> we transported ourselves into strange bookish worlds using green screen technology. In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-4">week 4</a> we started to plan our own Hacks and trained to be librarians.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> In <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/literacy/running-a-reading-hack-group-week-5">week 5 </a>we went all poetic with scissors and black markers.</span>
<h3>Week 6</h3>
Week 6 should have seen individuals running their own Hacks. However, our usual meeting room was closed for essential maintenance so we decided to split up. A group of Hackers would continue with their library training and the rest would complete their planned Hacks.
<h3>Minecraft Hack</h3>

They would put the Kano computer kit together and then use the pre-installed Minecraft app to build a library. The Hackers soon got to grips with plugging the components of the Kano kit together and quickly began using the various blocks to build a library. By using our Wi-Fi and Minecraft server they could work on the design and construction together in the same Minecraft world.

The rain can top up the swimming pool and underwater reading room!’</em>

They continued to impress Suffolk Libraries’ staff with their enthusiasm and professionalism.

Next week is our final week and so it’s competition time. Our Hackers will choose a library initiative to promote to their peers: either the recently launched <em><a href="http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/public-libraries-nationwide-celebrate-the-launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people">Shelf Help</a></em> from the Reading Agency or the <a href="http://imaginationeast.org.uk/">Read Me</a> summer holiday activities from ImagiNation East. Each Hacker has taken home information on one of the initiatives and will present their marketing strategy to the others next week for a Dragon’s Den style competition. One Hacker got ahead of the game by sharing the Shelf Help information to her Instagram followers before she left!
<h3>Hints and Tips:</h3>
<strong>Changing Plans:</strong> One of the benefits of Reading Hack is its adaptability. Quite often we do not get to finish Hacks, or even start them. Hackers are quite happy to chop and change. Reading Hack is not about planning sessions like a lesson, as long as there are activities available and Hackers record their participation on the website it is easy to see the new skills being picked up by members of the group.

<strong>Minecraft:</strong> We are lucky at Suffolk Libraries to have <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/blog/minecraft-and-childrens-lan-parties-at-thurston-library">Minecraft installed on all of our public computers </a>and have our own Minecraft server. The Hackers decided to use our Kano kits for the fun of building them, and both of them were familiar with Minecraft. There is a learning curve to placing the blocks for those unfamiliar with the game.

Mine didn’t have a roof either, but this was due to a lack of technical knowledge and not a design choice!
