This page contains resources for schools to use in conjunction with the 'Beyond the Book' activity booklet. Home educators should use the [contact us](/schools-literacy/literacy/contact) page to request resources for their child.

For each of the six activities in the booklet there is a relevant PowerPoint presentation with slides containing notes and tips on delivery. There is also a teacher handbook containing lesson starters, extension activities and plenaries.

There are also supplementary activities such as Thunks, Blanked Out Book Title Quiz and an Emoji Book Quiz. More will be added throughout the year. Feel free to use them and send us your feedback!

### Activities used in our Reading Hack Pilot (Word doc)

In April 2016 we started a Reading Hack pilot at Beccles library. We ran a [blog series](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/tag/reading-hack) explaining session by session how we ran the group. There are loads of great resources on the [Reading Hack website](http://readinghack.org.uk/), along with [Hack activities](http://readinghack.org.uk/hacks). We adapted some of the 'Hacks', and also came up with some of our own. You can download our activities below even if you are not running a Reading Hack group.

* [Literary 'Top Trumps' style activity](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-top-trump-hack.doc) and [template](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-top-trump-hack-template.doc). Top Trumps have some great bookish card games you can buy including Harry Potter, LOTR and an out of print Roald Dahl!
* [Comic Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-comic-hack.doc) - Make a comic book panel in response to something you’ve read.
* [Story Cube Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-story-cube-hack.doc) - Hack a classic children’s story by retelling it using story cubes. Story cubes have a different symbol on each side for you to use in your story. By taking the first few paragraphs of your favourite story and rolling the cubes out you could take the plot of your favourite story in a whole new random direction!
* [Green Screen Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-green-screen-hack.doc) - Use green screen technology to mash up books! Take a selfie and put yourself into a famous movie based on a book or onto the front cover of your favourite novel!
* [Poetry Jigsaw Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-poetry-jigsaw-hack.doc) - Cut up and rearrange a [Michael Rosen poem](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-poetry-jigsaw-hack-poem.doc) and make it your own!
* [Blackout Poetry Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-blackout-poetry-hack.doc) - Transform an old book into a new poetic form!
* [Minecraft Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-minecraft-hack.doc) - Use Minecraft to recreate a scene or landscape from your favourite book.
* [Create your own Hack](/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-create-your-own-hack.doc) - Come up with a new Hack for you and your friends to try out!
