This page contains resources for schools to use in conjunction with the 'Beyond the Book' activity booklet. Home educators should use the [contact us](/schools-literacy/literacy/contact) page to request resources for their child.

For each of the six activities in the booklet there is a relevant PowerPoint presentation with slides containing notes and tips on delivery. There is also a teacher handbook containing lesson starters, extension activities and plenaries.

There are also supplementary activities such as Thunks, Blanked Out Book Title Quiz and an Emoji Book Quiz. More will be added throughout the year. Feel free to use them and send us your feedback!

If you have issues with any of the files please [contact us](/schools-literacy/literacy/contact) or try right click and select save as to download the files.
