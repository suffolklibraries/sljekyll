A young Japanese geisha, Cio-Cio-San, clings on to the belief that her arranged marriage to a visiting American naval officer, Lieutenant Pinkerton, is loving and permanent. However, she finds her romantic idyll shattered when he deserts her shortly after their marriage, but she lives in hope that one day he will return.

Set against the backdrop 20th century Japan, the story triggers ideas about cultural and sexual imperialism.

Tickets available from the library and Southwold Arts Centre.
