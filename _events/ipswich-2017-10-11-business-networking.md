Join Ifty Nasir, CEO of [Vestd](https://vestd.com/), as he guides you through how technology can help you avoid common pitfalls and help you create a share scheme that suits your unique needs.

The workshop will cover three common pitfalls of using your equity and how to avoid them:

* Giving too much to someone who ultimately does not deliver
* Not keeping a clear cap table of what you’ve formally issued and what’s been promised, and the associated paperwork complexity
* Thinking the best thing to do with your equity is sell some to cash investors.
