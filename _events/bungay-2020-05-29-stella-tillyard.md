Join us for an evening with Stella Tillyard. Stella is an author and historian who has written eight fiction and non-fiction books. This event will focus on her 2018 historical fiction title [<cite>The Great Level</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2345396):

> "In 1649 Dutch engineer Jan Brunt arrives in Ely to begin the great endeavour of levelling and draining the Fens. His life and work are bound by order, measurement and science. England is in the throes of Civil War and Cromwellâ€™s troops are amassing, yet the real danger for him is water and the many labyrinthine channels that encompass the Great Level. Then one day lost on the level he spies a Fenswoman and everything he thought he knew starts to unravel.

> "Many years later, now a distinguished gentleman in Nieuw Amsterdam in the bustling hubbub of the New World, Jan receives a note, unsigned."

<cite>The Great Level</cite> is one of our [Discovereads](/discovereads/) titles for 2020 and was shortlisted for the [2019 New Angle Prize](/new-suggestions/articles/new-angle-longlist-2019/).

Ticket price includes refreshments.

Book in advance by contacting the library.
