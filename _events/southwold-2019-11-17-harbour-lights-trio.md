Join us at Stella Peskett Millennium Hall for an unmissable evening of music. Three Suffolk musicians (Derek Simpson, Alvar Smith & Rob Neal) perform mainly East Anglian songs and tunes on concertinas, melodeon, banjo, guitar, harmonica and cello. Their material ranges from local traditional chorus songs and tunes to music hall and a few more recent gems. The emphasis is on entertainment and audience participation.

There will be a bar and raffle and all funds raised will benefit the library.
