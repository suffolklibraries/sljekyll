The major new documentary <cite>Life on the Deben</cite> follows the River Deben from Debenham at the boatyards and bustle of Woodbridge down to the sea at Bawdsey and Felixstowe Ferry.

Produced in association with the Woodbridge Riverside Trust, the film is written and presented by John McCarthy and produced by Malcolm Hodd. It takes a journey into the Deben's rich past, looking at its geography, environment and the influence the river has had over the people who have lived by its banks.

The film features wildlife and conservation along the river and looks at daily life past and present, including boat building, sailing, farming, fishing, milling and even smuggling.

Book in advance by contacting the library. We recommend you book early as this will be a popular event. There may be repeat performances if there is sufficient demand.
