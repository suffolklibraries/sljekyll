This is Donâ€™s fourth solo exhibition at the library, and features some of his more surreal work. Showing the influence of Magritte, Hopper, De Chirico and Escher, this is a reimagining of the world. Mannequins in a strange environment, fish swimming through woodland, a bird flying around a planet&hellip; One thing is for sure, it's certainly a different perspective!
