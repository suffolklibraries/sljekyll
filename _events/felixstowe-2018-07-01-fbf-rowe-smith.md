Dr Jeni Smith is a published writer, educator and former lecturer at UEA. Emily is a primary school teacher. They are both passionate about childrenâ€™s writing, often collaborating in the classroom and for wider occasions such as a TED talk in 2017.

In their jam-packed workshop you will discover how to make a selection of folded books as well as a simple sewn book. There will also be creative ideas aplenty about how to fill your lovely books.

Recommended for ages 7-12, accompanying adults do not require a ticket.
