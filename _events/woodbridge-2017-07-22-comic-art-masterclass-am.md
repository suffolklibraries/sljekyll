It astounded, it inspired, it rocked ... and it's back - bigger and better! The Frolics and The Art Retreat are delighted to announce the return of Kev F's 'Comic Art Masterclass' for 7+ year-olds to Woodbridge.

During the 2 &frac12;-hour session, children will learn how to draw characters, then create their very own comic book in groups. At the end, not only will they have that comic to take home, but Kev F will draw and give each child an amazing caricature of themselves. See [Kev F's Comic Art Masterclass video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRK4YKUhAXM) for more information about the session.

Kevin F Sutherland illustrates for <cite>The Beano</cite> and Marvel among others. He has delivered this workshop to rapturous response across the UK. We're proud and delighted to welcome him back to Woodbridge.

Snacks, drinks and all materials provided.

Advance booking essential.
