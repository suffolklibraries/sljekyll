As part of Silver Sunday, older people are reminded that we hold a free gentle health walk on the first Sunday of the month.

Meet us at the library at 1:30pm for a stroll around local parks and nature reserves.

We'll get back to the library at around 3pm, where you can enjoy homemade cake and hot drinks for Â£1.
