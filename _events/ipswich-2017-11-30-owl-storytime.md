Young children and their parents/carers are invited to a special owl-themed storytime to celebrate the New Wolsey Theatre's forthcoming show <cite>'Wow!' Said the Owl</cite>, based on the [acclaimed children's book of the same name](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=991964).

The show itself runs from Tuesday 5 December. It brings to life Tim Hopgoodâ€™s book through a blend of beautiful story-telling, puppetry and music. Directed by Joy Haynes, the show will delight and excite children aged 2 to 5.

There will be a raffle to win a free family ticket for four to see the show between Wednesday 20 December and Tuesday 2 January.
