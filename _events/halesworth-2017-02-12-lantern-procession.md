Meet us in front of the library in warm clothes and boots and, if you like, a torch, lantern and a flask of hot drink for the annual Festival of Lights procession. We will be holding a [lantern-making session](/events/halesworth-2017-01-12-festival-of-lights/) earlier in the day.

The Oxblood Molly Dancers will start the procession with a dance. We will meander to the Green, and along the paths to the Willow Wherry, where there will be fires, and we will have a chance to celebrate the new year of wonders at the Green.
