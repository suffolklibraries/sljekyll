Drop in to the library to find out about the work the Stroke Association does from their display.

We also have a [talk on conquering stroke on Wednesday 22 May](/events/bury-2019-05-22-conquer-stroke/) and a [talk and health checks for older people on Friday 24 May](/events/bury-2019-05-24-top-time-stroke-assocation/).
