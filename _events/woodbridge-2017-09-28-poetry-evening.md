We're celebrating National Poetry Day and the 10th Anniversary of the Grey Hen Press with an evening of readings.

Ten years ago the Grey Hen Press was born to showcase poetry by older women. Poets Hilary Elphick, Sylvia Fairley, Kate Foley and Angela Kirby will read from Grey Hen anthologies published during the past ten years.

As the journalist Michele Hanson has remarked, “nothing mimsy about these poems by older women. Fierce, funny, disturbing and fairly vicious. Lovely.” This is sure to be a wonderful evening delivered by favourite local personalities.

Ticket price includes an interval drink. Anthologies will be on sale and available for signing.
