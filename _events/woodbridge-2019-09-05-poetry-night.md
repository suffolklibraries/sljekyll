We are very pleased to welcome back Kate Foley, local widely-published poet and president of the Suffolk Poetry Society, and her friend Pam Job. They will read their own poetry and there will be music performed by two great supporters of the work of the Friends of Woodbridge Library: Sylvia Fairley (flute) and Val Seeley (piano).

Ticket price includes an interval drink.

Contact the library to book.
