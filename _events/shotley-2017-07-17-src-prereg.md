Primary school-aged children are invited to get a head start on this year's [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) by pre-registering and borrowing their first book.

The theme this year is Animal Agents â€“ Horrid Henry illustrator Tony Ross has created a host of furry, slippery and feathered creatures who are ready to solve all kinds of crimes with their skills and natural instincts.
