Join local author Anthony Poulton-Smith for a talk about the origins of place names from all over the UK. There will be a Q&A session, so you can ask about places you'd like to know more about.

You can also buy a copy of Anthony's book, [<cite>Suffolk Place Names</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2245208), and get it signed after the session.
