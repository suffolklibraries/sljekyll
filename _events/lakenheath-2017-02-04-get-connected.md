We're marking the launch of Lakenheath Library's new iPad lending scheme with a special Get Connected event.

You can put your name down on the waiting list to borrow one of our two iPads, funded by West Suffolk District Council and supplied by Hughes Electrical. Like our physical books they will be completely FREE (provided you return them before the due date!) and you will get to keep them for up to 3 weeks.

Tech engineers from Hughes Electrical, as well as community group volunteers and library staff will be on hand to provide help and advice on using laptops, tablets or smartphones.

Refreshments will also be provided.
