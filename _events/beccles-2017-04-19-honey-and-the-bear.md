British folk and roots inspired duo, Honey & the Bear, combine delicately interweaving vocal harmonies with powerful guitar riffs, foot stomping rhythms and catchy melodies. The multi instrumentalist pair, comprised of songwriters Jon Hart (guitar, bass, mandolin) and Lucy Sampson (guitar, ukulele, bass, banjo & percussion), have been writing together since early 2014, having met at a songwriting event in 2012.

Kevin Walford is a singer/songwriter, originally from Liverpool, who formed his first band South Cheyenne in 1967. This same line-up later became Silk when they signed to major record label CBS Records/April Music, released four singles and toured extensively. Kev then relocated to Suffolk and became a part of the Suffolk Songwriters group.

Kelly is a well-established jazz singer based in Woodbridge, and previously fronted her own band Chasing Storms, playing a selection or original songs and jazz standards and also performs as Vocally Vintage singing songs from the 40s and 50s for Weddings, functions and Bar Mitzvahs.

For the last 18 months Kev and Kelly have been collaborating, gigging and recording, developing a great reputation in the East of England. Their music can best be described as Americana/Folk with maybe a touch of Cajun and Country thrown into the mix-with beautiful harmonies.
