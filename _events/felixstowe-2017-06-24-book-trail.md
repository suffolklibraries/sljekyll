A fun book trail for all the family.

Follow the trail around the town centre and decipher the book titles from the clues we've placed in shop windows. Take your completed trail to Felixstowe Library by 4pm on Sunday 2 July to be entered into a prize draw.

Trail sheets will also be available from the Orwell Hotel during the Felixstowe Book Festival on Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 July.
