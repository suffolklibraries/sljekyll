Start a new habit this [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/) by coming along to our regular Wellbeing Wednesday session. These informal sessions explore a different wellbeing practice each week.

This week we will be exploring the theme of morning routines:

* How can you make your morning work for you?
* What makes you feel good?
* How can a feel-good morning roll out into a brilliant day?

Ticket price includes refreshments.
