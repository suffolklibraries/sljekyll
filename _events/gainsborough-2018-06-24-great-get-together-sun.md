Make new friends and have fun with the following activities:

* 1pm: Free screening of a family favourite film - bring your own snacks or grab a specially made bag of film treats from our caf√©
* 2-3:30pm: Community crafts - make something with others as well as something you can take home
* 4:15pm: Bingo fun to round off a fantastic weekend bringing the community together, making new friends, saying "hello" to familiar faces and finding that we all have #MoreInCommon.
