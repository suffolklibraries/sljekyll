Are you looking for a way to relieve stress and anxiety and find your essence again? Come along to this workshop from Venetia Campbell, who will take you through The Form Reality Practice, a five-part moving meditation/dance which you can practice alone or share with another.

Venetia will teach you a short movement to use and share at home. There will be an opportunity for someone to sit on the chair to receive the full sequence and plenty of time to share with each other.

Book in advance by contacting Venetia on [07736 976190](tel:07736976190) or find out more on [Venetia's website](http://www.venetiacampbell.com/) or [The Community Wellness Project Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/holistichealthsuffolk).
