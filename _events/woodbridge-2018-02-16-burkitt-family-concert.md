This family band hailing from the Bawdsey Peninsula offers a beguiling mix of contemporary and traditional acoustic music, featuring tight vocal harmonies and beautifully played arrangements of well chosen songs.

Ross is an accomplished guitarist and singer and his partner Ali adds ethereal vocals and flute. They are joined by 16-year-old daughter Eliza on violin and 13-year-old son Sam on cello and guitar.

Ticket price includes a drink. Tickets must be purchased in advance from the library counter.

All proceeds to the Friends of Woodbridge Library.
