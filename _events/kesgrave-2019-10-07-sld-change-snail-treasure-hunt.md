Join us in the week leading up to [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) for a treasure hunt! Found the 15 hidden library names around the library and win a prize - Â£1 a go.

We'll also be creating a change snail trail all around the inside of the library, so please do being along any spare pennies you have and support your local library service.
