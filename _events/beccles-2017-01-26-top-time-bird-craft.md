To mark the RSPB Big Garden Bird Watch, we're offering the opportunity to make bird-related crafts. Come along and make an upcycled bug/bee house, bird feeders, pom-pom robins and blue tits and papercraft birds, or relax by colouring in 'mindfulness' bird-themed colouring sheets.

All materials and tools supplied, no experience necessary. No need to book.
