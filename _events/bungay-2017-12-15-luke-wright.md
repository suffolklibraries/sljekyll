Bungay Library patron Luke Wright is back to subject the English language to a series of degrading new tricks, all for your amusement.

Featuring a selection of poems from <cite>The Toll</cite> (Penned in the Margins, 2017) this show tours the flat-roofed pubs and half-bought couches of Brexit Britain. It struggles with doubt, duty and a score of half-cut nights spent shouting impotently at <cite>Question Time</cite>.

Spend an evening with a raconteur at the top of his game, as he spits out visceral, inventive verse that sweats, bleeds and sings.

Luke's events always sell out very quickly, so contact the library to book your ticket ASAP.
