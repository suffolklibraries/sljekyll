Having enjoyed drawing as a youngster, Tom returned to art as a retirement hobby when he joined Woodbridge Art Club. After first exploring different art media, he spent some time on monochrome portraits of past and current family members, inspired by the pencil painting technique of club member Rosario Zinna (featured in January’s ArtLib).

Tom’s more recent work has employed the watercolour medium, mainly depicting local settings - Woodbridge, Aldeburgh, Southwold and Flatford. His former occupation as an engineer and scientist has probably influenced his approach which has generally involved incorporating quite fine detail and has earned him a reputation at the club as 'the bricklayer'.

As well as examples of the above styles, the exhibition also includes works created using computer software to create an abstract design or to modify original watercolours to add further effects.

Most works displayed are available for sale as full size prints (ready framed or mounted for own framing) and as blank greeting cards. A selection of cards will be purchasable at the library during the exhibition. To contact the artist, visit [Tom's website](http://www.ambridgebooks.co.uk/art) or enquire at the library.
