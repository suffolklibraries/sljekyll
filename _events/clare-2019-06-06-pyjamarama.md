Come along to our [regular Tot Rock session](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) dressed in your pyjamas to help us celebrate bedtime stories for [BookTrust](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/pyjamarama/).

Bring your teddy, and if you let them stay for a sleepover (don't leave one you can't sleep without!), we'll tell you about all the adventures they had while the library was closed when you come and collect them!
