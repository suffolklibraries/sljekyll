Join us for a fantastic midsummer open mic music night at the village hall hosted by Ella Hayes. Everyone is welcome to bring their instrument or voice and perform.

Cheese boards consist of a selection of cheeses, crackers, pickle, fruit, bread and a drink. These are limited and must be ordered in advance by Friday 16 June. Bring your own extra drinks and glasses.

There will also be a raffle.
