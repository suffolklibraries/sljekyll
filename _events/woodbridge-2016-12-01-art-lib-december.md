Sue Studd is an artist who explores many different avenues. She has often used watercolours and encaustic wax, but she has recently been working with textiles, which are being exhibited at Woodbridge Library throughout December. In July, Sue had an exhibition at the Quay Gallery at Snape Maltings.

Sue moved to Martlesham with her husband and their two border collies four years ago from North West London, where she taught in primary schools. Sue says some time ago she saw some textile work in a shop, decided she would like to have a go herself and attended a few classes. She loves working with strong colours and is influenced by different aspects of nature, the sea, plants and flowers.
