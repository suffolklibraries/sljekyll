See trees decorated by village families, schools, businesses and organisations at the library and St Peter's Church. If you'd like to display a tree, contact Irene Churchus on [01359 230652](01359230652) or Richard Fawcett on [01359 231363](01359231363).  There will be activities for children at both venues. There will also be refreshments and a 3pm carol service at the church.
