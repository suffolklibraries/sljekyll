Everyone is invited to enter our poetry competition to celebrate Shakespeare's birthday and World Book Night. We'd like to demonstrate that anyone can produce poetry - no need to have expert knowledge of form and style!

## Rules

1. One poem per entrant
2. There are three categories:
    * Under 10s
    * 11-16 year-olds
    * All ages
3. Your poem can be **any theme, any style, rhyming or blank verse**
4. Entries will be judged by an appointed panel, whose decisions will be final
5. Winning entries will be announced and prizes presented at a World Book Night event at the library on Sunday 22 April.

## Prizes

* Book tokens for the best and second best in each category
* A Grand Prize of Â£50 for the best poem across all categories

**To enter, submit your poem to the library with a completed entry form (obtainable from the library) by Saturday 7 April**
