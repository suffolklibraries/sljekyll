A session for anyone who wants to pick up some new storytelling skills â€“ from parents and grandparents, to teenage siblings and babysitters.

Our interactive workshops led by a storytelling specialist will equip you with the skills and confidence to tell stories to your little ones in more creative ways, and even invent some of your own.

Booking is essential - please email **iheartnewmarket@spinningwheeltheatre.com** with your preferred session and how many people will be attending.
