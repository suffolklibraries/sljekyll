A film based on the hugely popular exhibition 'The Artist's Garden: American Impressionism and the Garden Movement 1887-1920 from the Florence Griswold Museum in Connecticut, considered to be the home of American Impressionism.

Taking its lead from French artists such as Monet and Cezanne, American Impressionism followed its own path which over a thirty year period reveals as much about America as a nation as it does about a much-loved artistic movement. A mesmerising film that is a feast for the eyes.
