Did you, or someone you know, help artist Constance Villemot make a giant fish on [Thursday 30 May](/events/lowestoft-2019-05-30-giant-fish/) or [Sunday 9 June](/events/lowestoft-2019-06-09-giant-fish/), or join in our [singing workshop with Snape Maltings' youth community choir Group A on Wednesday 12 June](/events/lowestoft-2019-06-12-singing-workshop/)? Come along and see the fish in action and join in the participatory performance of Ernest Hemingway's <cite>The Old Man and the Sea</cite> at the culmination of the First Light Festival.

This project is part of our [BLOC youth arts programme](/bloc/).
