Everyone is invited to enjoy performances and try something new at Market Hall.

Have a go at origami, playing a brass instrument, sewing, colouring, shaker making, arts, crafts and music, or just meet new people and have a chat. The WI will serving tea and cake.

If you have a skill to share - anything from dancing to science demonstration to a foreign language - and would like to get involved, please contact the library.
