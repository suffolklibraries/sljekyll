Do you know your books? Love reading?

To celebrate World Book Night we will be holding a lighthearted book quiz and book swap, with music provided by Tom.

Teams of up to 6, no need to book. There will be free hot drinks and nibbles but feel free to bring your own drinks. Bring a book to swap.

No children please.
