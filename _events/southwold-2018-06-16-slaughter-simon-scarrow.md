Simon Scarrow will be talking about his latest thriller, <cite>Playing With Death</cite>. Written with Lee Francis, it is both an edge-of-your-seat thriller and a terrifying exploration of the dangers of the modern world.

Simon's Eagles of the Empire novels are legendary amongst readers of historical fiction, and all his novels, including the World War II thriller [<cite>Hearts of Stone</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1877516). He is a regular on the <cite>Sunday Times</cite> bestseller list. Before becoming a full-time writer, Simon worked as a teacher and lecturer.

There will be an opportunity to buy Simon's books from Beccles Books and have them signed after the talk.
