Join us for a talk and book signing from Peter Tryon.

Peter's [<cite>Confessions of a Piano Tuner</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2064902) is a charming, autobiographical tale of life spent travelling around rural East Anglia tuning pianos. It is also a personal account from boyhood of how music and, more specifically, the mechanics of that wonderful instrument, fired early imagination and gave rise to a lifelong fascination and involvement with the piano.

In addition to tuning and repairing pianos of all sorts, Peter has worked as a teacher and a Director of Music. He is organist at the Parish Church in Lavenham.
