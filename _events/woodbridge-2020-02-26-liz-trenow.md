Join us for an evening with popular novelist Liz Trenow, who will be talking to journalist Catherine Larner about her latest book, [<cite>Under a Wartime Sky</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2688140), set around the development of radar at Bawdsey, Suffolk during WWII:

> "1936: The dark clouds of war are gathering across Europe and the brightest minds in Britain have been brought together in a grand manor on the Suffolk coast. These select few have been tasked by Churchill to develop, in utmost secrecy, an invention that will help win the war and alter the course of history. In this tense atmosphere, an unlikely friendship develops between Vic, a brilliant but shy physicist, and Kathleen, a cheerful local girl helping her mother in the kitchens."

Liz is the author of several historical novels including [<cite>The Last Telegram</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1289405), [<cite>The Forgotten Seamstress</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1493956) and [<cite>The Poppy Factory</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2015680). Her first two books were inspired by her family’s story as silk weavers in Suffolk. She worked as a journalist on regional and national newspapers, BBC radio and television news, before writing fiction.
