Take the challenge of visiting all six Ipswich Libraries on foot, exploring the town and covering several of its parks and the waterfront and help raise funds for [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/).

Get sponsored to complete our special circular twelve mile Ipswich library walking route or donate £1 for a leaflet and route map. The route covers [Broomhill Library](/libraries/broomhill-library/), [Chantry Library](/libraries/chantry-library/), [Gainsborough Community Library](/libraries/gainsborough-community-library/), [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/), [Rosehill Library](/libraries/rosehill-library/) and [Stoke Library](/libraries/stoke-library/).

The route won’t be marshalled or signposted - it’s something you can do in your own time, you can start at any of the libraries, and you don’t have to tackle the whole walk in one go.

Maps will be available from Stoke Library and Ipswich Library from Saturday 12 October - Tuesday 12 November.
