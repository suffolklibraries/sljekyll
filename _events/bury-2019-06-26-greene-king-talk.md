Tour guide Steve will give a talk on Greene King and how they brew their beers.

> "We’re really proud of our heritage, it’s taught us a lot. We’re also proud that we are as passionate about our beers today as our brewing ancestors were before us. We know it’s this innate passion in our people that means we brew quality beers day in, day out."
