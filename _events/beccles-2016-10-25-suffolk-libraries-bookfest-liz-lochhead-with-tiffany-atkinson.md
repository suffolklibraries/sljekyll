Liz Lochhead was Scots Makar – the Scottish equivalent of Poet Laureate – from 2011-2016, and Poet Laureate for Glasgow before that. She won the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2015. A true poet of the people, her work is popular, warm and witty but also challenging and fierce. She has published 18 books, from 1972’s <cite>Memo For Spring</cite> to a book of plays in 2012. Later collections, often written in Scots and Glasgow dialect, include <cite>True Confessions and New Clichés</cite> (1985), <cite>Bagpipe Muzak</cite> (1991), <cite>The Colour of Black and White</cite> (2003) and <cite>A Choosing</cite> (2011).

Tiffany Atkinson is an award-winning poet and Professor of Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. A funny and moving reader, her brilliant use of words and unusual imagery makes the everyday fresh and vivid. She is the author of three poetry collections: <cite>Kink and Particle</cite> (2006), which was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation and winner of the Jerwood Aldeburgh First Collection Prize; <cite>Catulla et al</cite> (2011), which received a Literature Wales Bursary and was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year prize; and <cite>So Many Moving Parts</cite> (2014), which was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.

Liz and Tiffany will both read from their work and will be in conversation with library manager, Ellen McAteer. There will be a cash bar serving refreshments when the doors open at 7pm.
