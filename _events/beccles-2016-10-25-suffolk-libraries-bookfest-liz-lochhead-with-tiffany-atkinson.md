Liz Lochhead was Scots Makar – the Scottish equivalent of Poet Laureate – from 2011-2016, and Poet Laureate for Glasgow before that. She won the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2015. A true poet of the people, her work is popular, warm and witty but also challenging and fierce. She has published 18 books, from 1972’s Memo For Spring  to a book of plays in 2012. Later collections, often written in Scots and Glasgow dialect, include True Confessions and New Clichés (1985), Bagpipe Muzak (1991), The Colour of Black and White (2003) and A Choosing (2011).

Tiffany Atkinson is an award-winning poet and Professor of Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. A funny and moving reader, her brilliant use of words and unusual imagery makes the everyday fresh and vivid. She is the author of three poetry collections: Kink and Particle (2006), which was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation and winner of the Jerwood Aldeburgh First Collection Prize; Catulla et al (2011), which received a Literature Wales Bursary and was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year prize; and So Many Moving Parts (2014), which was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.

Liz and Tiffany will both read from their work and will be in conversation with library manager, Ellen McAteer. There will be a cash bar serving refreshments when the doors open at 7pm.
