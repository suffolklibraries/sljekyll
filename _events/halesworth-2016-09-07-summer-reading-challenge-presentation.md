Congratulations to all of our young readers who completed The Summer Reading
Challenge, we will be celebrating your achievement in our Medals and Certificates
Presentation Ceremony. Bring along your family and friends, we hope to see you
there!

We would also like to say a huge thank you to our volunteers. We couldn't have
done it without you.
