> "In a time of constant debates around immigration both nationally and internationally, the BFI's latest Britain on Film on Tour programme looks back to chart a century of arrivals to the UK. Featuring the voices of different generations of British immigrants themselves, we are delighted to present <cite>Britain on Film: Welcome to Britain.

> "Whether seeking safety, freedom or simply a better life, the 20th century saw a rise in immigration to the UK. Sometimes welcomed, immigrants have also encountered hostility, racism and xenophobia even as they have enriched Britain’s economy and cultural life.

> "What emerges from these incredibly valuable films is a picture of a country in flux as a century of conflict, the end of Empire and the forces of globalisation challenged geographical boundaries. See Basque families fleeing the Spanish Civil War arrive in Southampton; Vietnamese children find sanctuary in Birmingham; a Jewish family escape the pogroms of pre-war Romania for a Derby suburb. Witness early multi-culturalism in London and Manchester, the stories of second generation immigrants amid racism and rioting in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and the traditions, restrictions and comforts of immigrant communities.

> "During a period in which some UK residents are being asked to re-frame their presence in the country, this programme explores the manifold costs to our shared humanity in turning people away and contends that all citizens should have a right to call themselves British: no matter where they started from."

Tickets available from the library and the arts centre. Fish & chip lunch must be booked in advance.
