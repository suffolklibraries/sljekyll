Help us celebrate and raise funds for [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/). As well as creative activities for both adults and children, there will be a treasure trail for children and a literary quiz for adults, and the chance to **meet some mystery Suffolk writers and artists** who have recently become Patrons of the library!
