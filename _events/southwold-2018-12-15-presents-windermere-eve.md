A new production of Oscar Wilde’s social comedy directed by award-winning writer, actor and director Kathy Burke, from the Vaudeville Theatre in London’s West End.

The day of Lady Windermere’s birthday party, and all is perfectly in order. Until her friend Lord Darlington plants a seed of suspicion. Is her husband having an affair? And will the other woman really attend the party?

First performed in 1892, <cite>Lady Windermere’s Fan</cite> explores the ambiguity of upper class morality and the fragile position of women in society in the late Victorian era in one of Wilde’s most popular and witty plays.

Kathy Burke brings together a talented comedic cast including the Olivier Award-winning actress Samantha Spiro as Mrs Erlynne, Kevin Bishop as Lord Darlington, and guest starring Jennifer Saunders as the Duchess of Berwick, marking her return to the West End stage for the first time in over twenty years.
