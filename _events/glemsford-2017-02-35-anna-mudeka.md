The Anna Mudeka Band presents “Dendende” – a tour celebrating their recently released 12 track album.

Packed with melodies and rhythms that speak to all generations and nationalities, this is a show full of truly global sounds – rocky, funk, reggae and African all at the same time. With songs in Swahili, Hindi and Shona, Anna Mudeka takes centre stage with her mbira playing while conga beat and six string bass underpin Zimbabwean rhythm.

Mudeka has previously performed at Latitude Festival, Drum Camp and Womad and has quite a following so we really hope that you can come along and join in the sounds of Sunshine Music. Toe-tapping and clapping will be unavoidable and dancing is positively encouraged &#8211; just what we need to banish any winter blues!

Soft drinks will be on sale during the interval and a prize draw will take place towards the end of the evening with proceeds split between the Friends Group and the Anna Mudeka Foundation. The Foundation aims to provide HIV orphans and disadvantaged children in Zimbabwe with an opportunity for an education.

**Buy tickets from the library: Adults &pound;5 and children &pound;1.**
