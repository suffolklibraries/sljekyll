On Carers' Rights Day, Eddie Cross, Carers' Lead from the Central Locality Integrated Delivery Team (IDT), will be at the library to offer advice to carers regarding their entitlements and how to find further assistance.

Carers are entitled to an assessment which looks at the impact of their role on areas such as work, money, housing, health, wellbeing and relationships and identifies areas where they may need more help or support.

This event is organised by Suffolk Family Carers. Eddie Cross works for the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT)
