Play games. Meet people. Have fun!

Take part in special gaming programs and events suitable for the whole family.

We're joining thousands across the world in celebrating the popularity and power of games and play for the ninth annual celebration of gaming in libraries – International Games Day.

The day will feature:

- **Free tables for board game use on the ground floor all day.** Bring your own game or borrow one from the Games Library.
- **Children’s board games at the Children’s Library on the ground floor all day.** These will include giant snakes and ladders in the morning and giant chess in the afternoon.
- **Wii Dance in the refreshment area on the ground floor from 9:30am-12noon.**
- **[Ipswich Junior Chess Club](http://www.ipswichchess.co.uk) in the first floor lecture hall from 10am-12noon.** Any standard of budding chess player aged 6-16 welcome.
- **Board game demos and further free tables for board game use in the first floor lecture hall from 12noon-4:30pm.**
- **Junior Minecraft Club in the second floor Hub from 9:30am-11:30am**. Bring your own wifi device to share worlds with one another.
- **A raffle to win a Waterstones voucher** to buy a board game (or a book or two).

This is a free event but donations to increase our game library would be welcomed.
