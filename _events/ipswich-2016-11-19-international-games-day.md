Play games. Meet people. Have fun!

Take part in special gaming programs and events suitable for the whole family.

We're joining thousands across the world in celebrating the popularity and power of games and play for the ninth annual celebration of gaming in libraries â€“ International Games Day.

<div class="custom-constrain"><iframe src="http://bit.ly/IGDMAP16" height="300" width="540" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>

This is a free event but donations to increase our game library would be welcomed.
