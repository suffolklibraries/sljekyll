Best-selling children’s author Peter Bunzl discusses his love of comics, cartoons and adventure stories, and how that led to a career in animation and writing. He explains how he combined research into real life Victorians, airships and automata (clockwork robots) with his own exciting ideas to create his highly acclaimed children’s book series The Cogheart Adventures.

Recommended for ages 7+.
