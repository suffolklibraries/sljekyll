Have fun and help raise funds for the library service on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) with our treasure hunt. Pick up a programme from the library and follow the trail around the town for the chance to win a luxury hamper!

We'll also provide a little treat for every child who takes part, and there will be refreshments and a raffle at the library.
