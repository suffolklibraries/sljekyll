Dr Rob Knee, historian and co-leader of Paston Footprints, will be at the library presenting the story of John Paston the Younger. This key member of the famous East Anglian family led the defence of Caister Castle, was wounded at the battle of Barnet, and went on to establish the Pastons' favourable position for the coming of the Tudor Age.
