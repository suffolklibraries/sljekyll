Set times:

* 8-8:30pm: Fern Teather

Fern Teather is a singer/songwriter from Suffolk who has been playing her own style of 'folk-edged Americana' all over the UK since 2013. In that time she’s released two EPs, and most recently her debut album <cite>Hiding in the Dark</cite>.

Fern will be accompanied by her partner Sam ‘Bongo Boy’ Thurlow, who adds an extra dimension to her music with his subtle, tactile and almost lyrical accompaniment on a variety of percussion and backing vocals.

* 8:35-9:15pm: Doozer McDooze

Doozer is a modern bard whose rousing vocals and buoyant acoustics weave stories of life, love, and the struggles of the Everyman. At turns irreverent and evocative, Doozer's folkpunk vibe is equally fitting for a roaring time at the pub or a night of camaraderie around the campfire.

* 9:30-10:30pm: Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs

Purveyors of East Angliacana.

"We play songs, eat supper and bring joy. It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it.""
