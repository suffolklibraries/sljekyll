Are you an aspiring independent author? Come along to this full-day workshop to find out how to get yourself and your manuscript to the point of publication, with guidance on assigning ISBNs, preparing preliminary formatting, establishing cover art and much more.

Ian Andrew published his first novel, <cite>A Time to Every Purpose</cite>, in 2014 and subsequently founded Leschenault Press and The Book Reality Experience, independent, hybrid publishing services that specialise in helping independent writers. He now combines management of these businesses with international speaking engagements and ghost-writing contracts. He is also the author of the Wright and Tran detective novel series.

Book in advance [online](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/whats-on/milton-road-north/stowmarket-library/ian-andrew-publish-on-demand-workshop/e-bmyvkl) or by contacting the library.
