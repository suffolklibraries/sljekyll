One of Britain’s foremost contemporary artists, Maggi Hambling is renowned for a prolific corpus, best known for her portraits, paintings of the sea, and public sculpture – both celebrated and controversial. Less familiar but equally significant are her works on paper, dynamic and sensuous – condensing the themes of life and death which underscore her art.

She forges an immediate and powerful connection with the subject being drawn, and it is this concept of 'touch' which pervades her work. Hambling will be discussing her new book which was published to coincide with an important retrospective of her work on paper at the British Museum which opened in 2016.

An exhibition of her new paintings and sculpture, titled EDGE, is on show at Marlborough Fine Art in London from 2 March until 13 April.
