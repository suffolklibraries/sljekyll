Preschool children and their parents/carers are invited to come along to our [regular Storytime session](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) dressed in their pyjamas to help us celebrate bedtime stories for [BookTrust](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/pyjamarama/). There will even be a special guest!
