Residents of IP3 (Gainsborough, Greenwich, Ravenswood & Nacton) are invited on a coach trip to High Lodge at Thetford Forest, departing from the library at 8:30am and leaving Great Yarmouth at 6pm. Members of the Gainsborough Community People's Forum will be coming along to help you plan your day.

Spaces are limited, so reserve in advance by contacting the library. Payment must be received at least two weeks before the trip.
