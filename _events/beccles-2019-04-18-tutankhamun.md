Come along to hear the long lost voice of the Young Prince. Walk with him through his time, feel his joys and pains, and experience what it means to be a pawn in the power house that was the Egyptian hierarchy.

Aisha Sorisi has researched the history of Tutankhamun for over 20 years, and has been writing for the last four, producing a trilogy of adult books as well as a children's book. She will talk about how she started writing, where her motivation comes from, and her passion for all things Egyptian!

Aisha will be dressed in traditional clothing, and will bring along artefacts to support her talk.

Although this talk is in our regular Top Time slot, it is suitable for adults and children.
