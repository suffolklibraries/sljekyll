Josephine Reynolds will be at the library talking about and signing copies of her book <cite>Fire Woman</cite>, about her experiences of being Britain's first full-time female firefighter in 1980s Norfolk.

When Josephine signed up with the Norfolk Fire Service in July 1982 at just seventeen years old, there was no such thing as a firefighter - only fire men.

Set against the slate-grey backdrop of early 1980s Britain, <cite>Fire Woman</cite> is the story of how a young woman brought up in rural Wales coped in the testosterone-fuelled world of the fire brigade, where even today 96 per cent of all staff are male.

Copies will be available to buy on the day.

Contact the library for more details.
