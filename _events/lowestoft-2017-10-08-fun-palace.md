People of all ages are invited to have fun and have a go at sign language, re-enactment, making putt putt boats and tying knots among many other things. There will also be pirate-themed crafts and activities for children and The Longshore Men will be singing sea shanties.

"Everyone an artist, everyone a scientist."
