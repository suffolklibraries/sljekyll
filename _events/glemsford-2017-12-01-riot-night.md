Join us for a commemoration of the polling riots of 1885, when Glemsford working folk descended on Long Melford and started a riot that caused such havoc that the military had to be called in from Bury St Edmunds to restore order. It was the last time that the Riot Act was read out, and it is local legend that this is how Glemsford got its nickname of 'Little Egypt', as the men were said to fight like Egyptians!

The evening starts with an optional march to the Angel, where they will be serving 'Rioters Ale' specially brewed for us by the Nethergate Brewery.

From there, we'll head back to the Village Hall, where votes will be cast and the Riot Act read before we enjoy Tavern tucker, performances from the Glemsford Morris Men, a local raconteur and a folk band. There will also be a licensed bar.

Tickets are available online (with a Â£1.05 booking fee) and from the library and the Angel.
