**This event has been cancelled due to poor weather conditions**

Meet us outside the library for our health walk. We will be sharing lifts to a lay-by off the A12 near Capel, where we will start our 4 mile walk.

This will be followed by optional home-made refreshments at the library (otherwise closed) for Â£1.

Dogs and accompanied children welcome.
