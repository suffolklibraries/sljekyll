> "From the exhibition walls to the wonder and beauty of artists’ gardens like Giverny and Seebüll, this film takes a magical and widely travelled journey to discover how different contemporaries of Monet built and cultivated modern gardens to explore expressive motifs, abstract colour, decorative design and utopian ideas. Guided by passionate curators, artists and garden enthusiasts, this remarkable collection of Impressionists, Post-Impressionists, and avant-garde artists of the early 20th century will reveal the rise of the modern garden in popular culture and the public’s enduring fascination with gardens today. Long considered spaces for expressing colour, light and atmosphere, the garden has occupied the creative minds of some of the world's greatest artists. As Monet said, 'Apart from painting and gardening, I’m no good at anything.' For lovers of art or lovers of gardens, this is an ideal film."
