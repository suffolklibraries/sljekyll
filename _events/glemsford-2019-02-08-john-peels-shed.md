**This performance is an ode to radio and features a selection of records previously owned by John Peel.**

In 2002, John Osborne won a competition on John Peel's Radio 1 show. His prize was a box of records that took eight years to listen to. This is an ode to radio, those records and anyone who's ever sought solace in wireless.

The show was first performed at the Edinburgh festival where it was a complete sell out, receiving five star reviews from <cite>The Scotsman</cite> and <cite>The Independent</cite>. It then went on a national tour, including performances at Glastonbury festival, Latitude and a run at the Soho Theatre.

Tickets are available online, from the library, and from Compact Music, North Street, Sudbury.
