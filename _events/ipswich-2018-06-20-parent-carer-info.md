Do you have a child with a disability or additional needs? Drop in to find out about the information and support offered by Contact and Suffolk Parent Carer Network.

## Contact

The Contact parent advisor for the East of England can give information on the following and much more:

* Support services and how to access them
* Understanding and managing your child's behaviour
* Money Matters
* Managing stress

Your child does not need to have been diagnosed to attend.

## Suffolk Parent Carer Network

Parents and carers of children with additional needs and/or disabilities from the Suffolk Parent Carer Network will be in the library until 2pm. Find out how they work with education, health and care services to make sure the services they plan and deliver are fit for purpose and meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Suffolk.
