Join us at our regular Sporting Memories reminiscence session for over-50s with special guest speaker Paul Events.

Olympic athlete and marathon winner Paul will share memories of his career, which included two Olympics, three World Championships and running marathons all over the world. You are encouraged to bring your own memorabilia and share your own memories.

The event will be taking place in our 1st floor Lecture Hall. Sporting Memories meets weekly and includes chats, games and activities.
