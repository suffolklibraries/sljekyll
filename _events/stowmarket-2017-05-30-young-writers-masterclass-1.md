Do you want to write exciting, professional stories or short films?

This half-term, we're running two exclusive masterclasses with award-winning children's author Steve B Mason.

This first session covers the 5 secrets of creating compelling characters, and participants will learn a lot more besides. If you can't make it to the [second part of the course on Thursday 1 June](/events/stowmarket-2017-06-01-young-writers-masterclass-2/), which covers plot design, you can pick up a handout for free.
