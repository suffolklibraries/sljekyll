All ages are invited to join us for an energetic and interactive telling of <cite>Granny Dumpling</cite> from the Widdershins Theatre Company.

Granny Dumpling makes the very best dumplings in all of Japan. When a fresh batch rolls away, she follows them on an adventure down into a goblin's underground lair.
