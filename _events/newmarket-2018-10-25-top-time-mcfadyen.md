Author Ian McFadyen will be at the library talking about and signing his Inspector Carmichael books, the most recent of which is [<cite>The Steampunk Murder</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392948):

> "When the body of Kendal Michelson, a leading light in the local Steampunk movement, is found on a popular seaside beach impaled by his own sword, the querulous Inspector Carmichael is reluctantly drawn into the curious and unfamiliar world of Steampunk. Who killed Kendal Michelson? Do any of his seemingly-close friends or ex-partners know more than they are telling?"
