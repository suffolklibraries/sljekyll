Cordelia Fonte will be talking about writing and getting published, and selling and signing copies of her book, <cite>The Worst Hangover</cite>:

> "Rebecca Hadley is an unhappily married mother of two young children living in a small English town. Her husband, Stuart, is controlling and abusive. On a rare night out with friends, Rebecca enjoys a kiss with long-time friend, Chris. She decides that this shows her that her marriage is over and, the next morning, tells Stuart.

> "Stuart throws her out and keeps the children. Rebecca, while also dealing with some major health issues of her own, then has to cope with the fallout of her indiscretion and the subsequent divorce battle with her husband and the actions of Chris' now ex-girlfriend, Maxine.

> "<cite>The Worst Hangover</cite> describes Rebecca's complicated life, her marriage, children and relationships, and how she deals with everything that is thrown at her."
