To launch this year’s [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) and officially open our refurbished children’s shelving, we are having a <cite>Toy Story</cite> morning. Why not come along dressed as your favourite character and meet Buzz Lightyear, or take part in our amazing themed craft?

There will also be a tombola, cakes and refreshments, as well as a cartoon-inspired raffle. You can also sign up for the Summer Reading Challenge while you're here.

No need to book, just pop along!
