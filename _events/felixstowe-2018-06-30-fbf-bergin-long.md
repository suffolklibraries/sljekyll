> “Sixty years after a virus has wiped out almost all the men on the planet, the female population has grieved, pulled together and moved on, and life really is pretty good – if you’re a girl. It’s not so great if you’re a boy, but fourteen-year-old River wouldn’t know that. Until she met Mason, she thought they were basically extinct…”

Virginia Bergin’s third book [<cite>Who Runs the World?</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160824), presents a world in which women are in control. Costa Award nominated author Hayley Long interviews Virginia about this page-turning novel. Hayley has written eight novels and one non-fiction book for teens.

Join us for lunch with two fantastic YA writers as they talk about their work and what growing up as a girl means 100 years on from female enfranchisement.

Suitable for ages 12+, includes a light lunch in the Room at the Top.
