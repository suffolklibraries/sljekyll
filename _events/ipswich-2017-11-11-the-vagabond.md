## 9-10:40pm (including a break): The Vagaband

The Vagaband are an extremely talented, entertaining  - and frankly brilliant - Norwich based band who play a mixture of Americana, folk and acoustic rock with a sprinkling of country, blues and soul. Their performances are both poignant and pulsating, featuring beautifully crafted ballads alongside foot stomping floor-fillers. Their full line-up features a wide range of instruments and their music is full of joyous 3 and 4 part vocal harmonies and catchy melodies. They have played at various festivals around the country, including Bestival, Camp Bestival, Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party, Shambala, Hull Freedom Festival, Winchester Hat Fair, as well as many other venues.
