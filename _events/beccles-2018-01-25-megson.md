Three times nominated in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and double winners of the  Spiral Earth Awards, Megson draw heavily on their Teesside heritage to create a truly unique brand of folk music.

Husband-and-wife duo Debs and Stu Hanna bring an infectious mix of heavenly vocals, lush harmonies and driving rhythmic guitars. Megson have gained fame on the British folk scene, not only for their arresting & intelligent songwriting, but for their exquisite musicianship and northern humour. As <cite>fRoots Magazine</cite> put it, ‘if you don’t like the music here then you have a problem’

Summer 2016 saw the release of their much-anticipated new studio album <cite>Good Times Will Come Again</cite>, gaining them much critical acclaim.
