> "A calamity of epic proportions is underway, and you and your team are the only ones who can save us! Can you create something that will protect the world during the apocalypse? What about something to avert the apocalypse altogether? Time to get your survival kits out and your thinking hats on, as you #MakeYourIdeas and save us all!"

Keen young makers aged 11-16 and adult mentors are invited to take part in the latest two-day Pioneers challenge.

Participants will work together in teams of up to five to design and build creations that solve a series of challenges. They will also get to make a short video to share their creations.

Register online through [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/raspberry-pi-pioneers-tickets-37995883711?utm_term=eventname_text) by 28 October.
