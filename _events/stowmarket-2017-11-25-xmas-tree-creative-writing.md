Has the Stowmarket Christmas Tree Festival moved you to write a poem or prose?

We're offering you the chance for your writing to appear in a special book ahead of next year's festival. Whether the Christmas trees evoke memories or stir your imagination, send us a poem or short story and you might get to see your name in print.

Simply hand in your piece at the library, Stowmarket Parish Church or the Museum of East Anglian Life by 1 February 2018.
