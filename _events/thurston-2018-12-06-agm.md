All are welcome to the Friends of Thurston Library AGM. Find out what we've been up to, what we plan to do next, and how you can get involved.

The short meeting will be followed by entertainment from a capella group Amado and cheese and wine.

No tickets required, but please contact the library or call Richard Fawcett on [01359 231363](tel:01359231363) to let us know you're coming so we can arrange enough refreshments.
