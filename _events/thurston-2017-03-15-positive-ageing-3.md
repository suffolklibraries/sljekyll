> Aging is not lost youth but a new stage of opportunity and strength. <cite>Betty Friedan, American writer and activist</cite>

> You don’t stop playing because you are old; you get old because you stop playing <cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

This course, run by Ian Flintoff, is designed for all those over 50 who may wonder what later life may hold for them – whether starting retirement, coping with loss or worries about your health, financial issues or a general sense that your best days are over!

Ian worked in education for over 32 years, including 20 years as a senior manager/headteacher in large state secondary schools in England. In 2014 he changed career to study a Master’s degree in applied positive psychology, and to start his own business to help people develop their own resilience and wellbeing in every area of life. Ian takes a practical, humorous and uplifting approach to looking after yourself and to living life to the full whatever your age or personal challenges.

Each week will include a range of information and up-to-the-minute research about positive ageing, some practical techniques you can practise at home to relieve stress and gain greater calm and perspective.

You'll get abundant opportunities to hear and discuss what will boost the quality of your life.

Pop into the library for more details and to let Cathy, our librarian, know you are coming.
