Francesca Armour-Chelu is a Suffolk-based author and librarian who grew up by the Suffolk coast. Her experience of living on water meadows in an abandoned Edwardian railway carriage inspired her debut novel [<cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1977471). The sequel, [<cite>Fenn Halflin and the Seaborn</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2167085) won the Mal Peet Children's Award at the East Anglian Book Awards. Her latest book, [<cite>The Butterfly Circus</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2561248), came out in June.
