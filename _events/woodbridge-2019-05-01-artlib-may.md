Sue is a local artist who works mainly in professional colour pencils and pastels. However, she also loves to work white on to black surfaces to create a serene look. Her inspiration comes from the natural world with all its beautiful colours and shapes.

Sue additionally likes to create pictures with the method of paper cutting. This is a unique art form, taking several hours to several days to complete. She uses a Swann Morton scalpel with non-surgical blades to carefully cut pieces of paper away from a single sheet, leaving behind an intricate design. The design is then mounted and secured in place.
