Steve had worked in both the oil and nuclear industries before settling into a career in wildlife conservation with Suffolk Wildlife Trust. A Suffolk resident for 27 years, he has explored much of the Suffolk coast, camera in hand, and this exhibition revives an early interest in traditional black & white landscape photography but utilising current digital camera and image processing technology.

This exhibition explores narrative in coastal landscapes. Black and white photographs explore a subtle narrative, relating to the landform and ecology of the coast punctuated by manmade structures. Big skies are a common theme adding both drama and scale to the landscape.
