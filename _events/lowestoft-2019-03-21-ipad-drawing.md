Led by artist [Alfie Carpenter](https://www.alfiecarpenter.com/), we will be exploring the possibilities of the drawing software Procreate. We believe you don’t need to be an ’artist’ to draw and create. Come and draw the undrawable ... What is on your mind?

This event is free, though [online booking](https://artslibraries.typeform.com/to/BXNytL) is required. All equipment and refreshments will be provided. We look forward to seeing you!
