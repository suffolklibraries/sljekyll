After the success of his one-man adaptations of Charles Dickensâ€™ novels <cite>Oliver Twist</cite>, <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>, <cite>Great Expectations</cite> and <cite>David Copperfield</cite>, James is delighted to present his own spine-chilling adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic gothic-horror novel <cite>Dracula</cite>.

In his one-man play, James thrillingly brings to life a cast of well-known characters including Jonathan Harker, his beautiful fiance Mina, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, the crazed bug-eating Renfield and, of course, the demonic Transylvanian count.

<cite>Dracula</cite> is not suitable for children under 12 and has a running time of approximately 100 minutes plus an interval.
