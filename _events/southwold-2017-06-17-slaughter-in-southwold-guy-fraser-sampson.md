His <cite>Mapp &amp; Lucia</cite> novels have all been optioned by BBC TV, and with <cite>Death in Profile</cite> he begins a new series entitled <cite>The Hampstead Murders</cite> harking back to the Golden Age of detective writing.

The second in the <cite>Hampstead Murders</cite> series, <cite>Miss Christie Regrets</cite> opens with a sudden death at an iconic local venue, which some of the team believe may be connected with an unsolved murder. It soon emerges that none other than Agatha Christie herself may be the key witness who is able to provide the missing link.

A book signing will follow this event, with books for sale courtesy of Beccles Books.

We recommend booking in advance. Tickets are available from the library, by calling [01502 722519](tel: 01502722519) and online.
