To celebrate the [Arthur Ransome Pin Mill Jamboree 2017](https://www.facebook.com/arthurransomepinmilljamboree/), we are holding a book group for the community to discuss and reminisce about [<cite>We Didn't Mean to go to Sea</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=220574).

Come along to share your memories of the book. Did you and your friends recreate any of the scenes?!

Copies of the book will be available to borrow, and there will be free refreshments.
