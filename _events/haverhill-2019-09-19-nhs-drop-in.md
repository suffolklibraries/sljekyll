eConsult is an app that can help you remotely consult your own GP by filling in a quick online form, as well as direct you to self-help, pharmacy advice and local self-referral services.

NHS staff will be at the library to show you how to use eConsult and answer any questions you may have. Bring your own smartphone or tablet or use one of the library's devices.
