Are you interested in gardening but unsure where to start, want to get some experience, or don't have the space at home? Or perhaps you'd like to get your children into gardening, meet new people, or help make your library beautiful? Come along to our Community Garden induction and find out more about how you can help us grow something beautiful.

We're looking for patch keepers to have their own plant bed in our garden as well as home propagators who can grow some seeds on their sunny windowsills at home before returning them to the library when they're ready for the big wide world.

No experience is necessary and you can find out more about these schemes and ask questions on the day.

Contact the library in advance to register your interest. If you can't make it on the day, we'd still love to hear from you!
