A sensational new dance event for cinemas from the internationally acclaimed choreographer Matthew Bourne.

Loosely based on Bizet’s popular opera, Carmen, with one of the most thrilling and instantly recognisable scores in classical music, the familiar 19th Century Spanish cigarette factory becomes a greasy garage-diner in 1960’s America where the dreams and passions of a small-town are shattered by the arrival of a handsome stranger. Fuelled by heat and desire, the inhabitants are driven into an unstoppable spiral of greed, lust, betrayal and revenge.
