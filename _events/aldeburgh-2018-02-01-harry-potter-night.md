Young wizards, witches and muggles are invited to join us for Harry Potter Book Night. We will be participating in the Bloomsbury/British Library Living Knowledge Network 'Beasts among the Bookshelves' event. Expect readings about beasts from the Harry Potter books, followed by some beastly facts, questions and prizes.

There will also be games and Harry Potter-inspired snacks.

Tickets available in advance by contacting the library.
