Find out how you make new friends, gain new skills and experiences, support your local community and have fun as a volunteer at local sports, festival, family and community events.

Events such as the Lowestoft Summer Festival, Lowestoft Half Marathon, Discover Lowestoft and EACH Colour Dash depend on volunteers donating as little as 1-2 hours of their time once a year.
