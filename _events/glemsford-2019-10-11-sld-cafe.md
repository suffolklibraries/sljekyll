**Lunch will be served from 11:30am**

Get together over some food and help raise funds for [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) with our Friday café. Expect tea, coffee and cake, as well as soup, bread and cheese (served 12pm-1pm) and the chance to hear stories from local author and professional storyteller Leonie Jane-Grey.

Leonie is publishing a new children's book, <cite>Triana's Journey</cite>, with all profits going to the library service. You can pre-order a copy for £5.99 and pick it up at the beginning of November.

At 12:30pm, the [Suffolk Libraries Day Book Journey](/suffolk-libraries-day/book-journey/) will be making its stop at Glemsford Library! Wave library manager Sue and the real Triana the unicorn off on their journey to Bury St Edmunds Library.
