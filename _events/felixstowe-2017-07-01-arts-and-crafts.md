Children aged 3-6 are invited to join Top That Publishing for arts and crafts in the children's section. Try out lots of Arty Mouse-themed stamping, sticking, painting, colouring, tracing and stenciling.

All materials are provided, and children who complete an activity will be entered into a free prize draw.

No need to book, just drop in at any time during the session.
