Knowledgeable and humorous storyteller Dave Tonge will be telling stories and discussing his book <cite>Tudor Tales</cite>.

Dave Tonge has been telling tales since 1999. Prior to that he was a jack of all trades but, unhappy with the road he was traveling, decided to study for a BA and MA in English history and the first year of a PhD focusing on the relationships between Tudor men and women.

It was then that he discovered story telling and ran away to become an itinerant teller of tales!

Refreshments included in ticket price. Supported by Friends of Long Melford Library.
