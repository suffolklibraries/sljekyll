People with dementia and their carers are invited along to Stradbrook Courthouse & Library Trust's (SCALT) monthly Friday Friends café. Meet and chat with others and get help and advice from your peers as well as an expert.

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.
