Are you, or do you know someone, living with a long-term condition and doing less than 30 minutes of moderate activity per week? Drop in and chat to OneLife Suffolk about their Get Help To Get Active service.

Get Help To Get Active aims to support and encourage you to raise your levels of physical activity, whether you just need signposting in the right direction or wish to attend sessions that can help you change how you feel about and approach physical activity.

The team at OneLife Suffolk understand that being physically active can be very challenging, particularly if you are faced with a long-term condition. They can provide the tools and information to enable you to gradually increase your activity levels, in a safe and effective way.
