Whether you've never tried meditation before, or are an experienced practitioner, you're welcome to join us for this session. We'll spend the first 15 minutes exploring different meditation techniques, then have a refreshment break, then spend the last 15 minutes using our preferred techniques independently.

No need to book, just come along.

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.

These sessions are running each Thursday until 5 March inclusive, with no session on 27 February.
