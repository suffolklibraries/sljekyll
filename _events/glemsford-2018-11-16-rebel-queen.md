Join storyteller Liam Carroll and musician Jonathan Lambert for a dramatic and humorous retelling of Boudicca's challenge to the might of imperial Rome.

The story details an important and pivotal moment in British history and places East Anglia at the heart of significant geopolitical events. It tracks the dilemmas of a ruler and mother in Ancient Britain and blends moments of tenderness with the brutal choices that lie before a leader in a time of crisis.

Suitable for age 14+.

Refreshments available.

Tickets available online and from the library.
