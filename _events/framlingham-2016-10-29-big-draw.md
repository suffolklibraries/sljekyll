FlipSide, in association with the FAYAP (Framlingham Area Youth Action Partnership) Big Pencils Project and with sponsorship from Arts Framlingham, is bringing The Big Draw to Framlingham.

The Big Draw is a free event for all ages, which aims to promote drawing and its many uses and pleasures - and the Big Draw in Framlingham will offer people the chance to have a go at drawing in the heart of this beautiful market town. All art materials, boards and easels will be available so that anyone can pick up a pen, pencil or piece of charcoal and have a go at drawing.

As well as the library, various locations around the town such as St Michael's Church and St Michael’s Rooms and Framlingham Unitarian Meeting House are getting involved with The Big Draw.  The central base will be in the market on Market Hill.

There will be a town art trail, eye catching visual displays, and artists including cartoonist Simon Farr, portrait artist Jack Stephenson and The Suffolk Group’s Graham and Julie Giles will be on hand to help to inspire your creativity. The day will culminate in celebration of drawing with a display of artwork produced.
