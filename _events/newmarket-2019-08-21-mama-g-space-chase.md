Mama G is returning to Haverhill Library with an interactive storytelling experience for the whole family inspired by this year's [Summer Reading Challenge: Space Chase](/src/).

Mama G's Space Chase will take listeners on an out-of-this world adventure and remind everyone to appreciate the beautiful world we live in and the amazing people we share the stars with. Expect stories about Laika the space dog, first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova, and an alien named Alan who is obsessed with coming to live on planet Earth!
