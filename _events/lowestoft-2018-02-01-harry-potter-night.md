What’s that stomping through the bookshelves?

Discover a menagerie of magical monsters at Lowestoft Library as local storytellers read beastly extracts from the Harry Potter series.

Along the way you’ll discover some weird and wonderful facts about these fantastic beasts, and be in with a chance to win some beastly prizes.
