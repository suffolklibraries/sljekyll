We're raising funds for the library service in the week leading up to [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) by challenging staff, volunteers and customers to cycle 323.9 miles between them on a static bike - the total length of the [Suffolk Libraries Day Book Journey](/suffolk-libraries-day/book-journey/)! Sponsor one of the cyclists, donate while you're in the library, or even join the cycle team yourself!
