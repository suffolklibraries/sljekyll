Join us for our Summer Fair extravaganza.

Enjoy a tombola, a raffle and stalls as well as a barbecue, cakes and refreshments.

For children, there will be balloon modelling, circus skills and soft play with Mr Bean as well as games, competitions and prizes.

To celebrate the theme of this year's [Summer Reading Challenge](/src), come dressed up as an animal for our fancy dress competition, which will be judged by the Mayor of Ipswich at 1:30.
