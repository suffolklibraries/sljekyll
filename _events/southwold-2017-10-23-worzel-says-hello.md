Children and their parents/carers are invited to meet the star of <cite>Worzel Says Hello!</cite>, listen to the story and learn how to greet dogs safely.

Written by Catherine Pickles and illustrated in watercolour by Chantal Bourgonje, <cite>Worzel Says Hello!</cite> introduces children to Worzel Wooface, literary Lurcher and local celebrity. Through Worzel's perspective, children can learn how dogs think and feel, so that they can develop wonderful relationships with the dogs in their lives and make dogs feel happy, safe and loved.

Please NO OTHER DOGS at this event!
