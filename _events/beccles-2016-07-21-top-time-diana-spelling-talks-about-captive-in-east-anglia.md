Author Diana Snelling is our guest speaker. She will talk about writing <cite>Captive in East Anglia</cite>, supported by still photographs from the book.

Looking at the plight of the Italian and German Prisoners of War during and immediately after the War, this book asks the question "Could we have survived without their help?".

The book contains childhood memories of people still living today and gives a first-hand look at the shortages, privations and fears that characterised the Home Front.

No need to book - just come along. Free to attend. Refreshments provided.
