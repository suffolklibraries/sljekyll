David Suchet stars as Lady Bracknell in Vaudeville Theatre's production of Oscar Wilde's <cite>The Importance of Being Earnest</cite>.

> "Two bachelor friends, the adorable dandy Algernon Moncrieff and the utterly reliable John Worthing J.P., lead double lives to court the attentions of the exquisitely desirable Gwendolyn Fairfax and Cecily Cardew. The gallants must then grapple with the riotous consequences of their deceptions – and with the formidable Lady Bracknell.
