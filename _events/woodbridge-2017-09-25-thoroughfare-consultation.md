Drop in to the library to find out about and comment on the Woodbridge Thoroughfare Working Group's ideas for solving traffic and parking problems on The Thoroughfare.

Woodbridge County Councillor Caroline Page has brought together a cross-party working group of councillors, police, traders, residents and representatives from Suffolk County Council's highway team to address the problems caused by the current, outdated Traffic Regulation Order (TRO).

They have come up with three different options, based around a simple, easy-to-understand sign. This is your chance to find out about the benefits and drawbacks of each idea and have your say about which you think is best.

If you can't get to the library, you can also [see and comment on the consultation documents online](http://carolinepage.blog.suffolk.libdems.org/) from 25 September.
