A National Dementia Awareness Week (14-20 May) event.

Come along to the Meeting Room to hear Cathy O'Brien from the Seckford Foundation talk about dementia and how to become a Dementia Friend:

"Dementia can affect a personâ€™s relationships and their connection to the world they love, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. By becoming a Dementia Friend you can help keep people connected to their lives and people who matter most."

There will also be a chance to find out more about the work of the Alzheimer's Society and the support they can offer.

No booking necessary.
