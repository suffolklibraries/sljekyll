[NessFest](https://www.facebook.com/NessFestLowestoft/) is back for a second year!

Drop in and have a go at making bushcraft jewellery with Suffolk Wildlife Trust. Try whittling and using palm drills, bow saws and other woodland equipment to make Elder beads and tree cookie necklaces and keychains.
