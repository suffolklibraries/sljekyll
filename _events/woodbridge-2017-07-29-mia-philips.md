Come along and join in this informal conversation about the three foundational principles behind our experience of life: Mind, Consciousness and Thought.

We will explore how life works, where our experience is coming from and who we truly are. We will also consider how knowing ourselves deeply, not as what we Think we are but as we Truly are, can help us navigate life, our choices, plans and decisions from the life-changing to the mundane. 

Pay on the door. For more information see [Mia's website](http://www.miaphilips.com) or [Mia's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SC3PC).
