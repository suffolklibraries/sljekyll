Simon Edge will be at the library talking about his new book [<cite>The Hopkins Conundrum</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2157824):

> "Tim Cleverley inherits a failing pub in Wales, which he plans to rescue by enlisting an American pulp novelist to concoct an entirely fabricated 'mystery' about Gerald Manley Hopkins, who composed 'The Wreck of Deutschland' nearby.

> "Blending the real stories of Hopkins and the shipwrecked nuns he wrote about with a contemporary love story, while casting a wry eye on the Dan Brown industry, <cite>The Hopkins Conundrum</cite> is a highly original mix of commercial fiction, literary biography and satirical commentary."

Signed copies of the book will be available to buy. Please reserve a seat by contacting the library.
