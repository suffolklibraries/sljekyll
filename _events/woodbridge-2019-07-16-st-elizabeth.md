It provides personal care such as bathing and washing, practical domestic support such as housework and shopping, and community support such as respite for family carers.

St Elizabeth Care Agency is a wholly owned subsidiary of St Elizabeth Hospice and all profits made by the agency are donated to the hospice to further its work to improve life for people living with a progressive or terminal illness.
