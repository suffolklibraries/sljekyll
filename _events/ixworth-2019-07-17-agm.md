Everyone is invited to our AGM to find out what the Friends have achieved this year, what their future plans are, and how you can get involved.

If you would like to make a nomination for the role of chair, secretary or treasurer, to stand as a trustee of FOIL, email **ixworth.library@suffolklibraries.co.uk** or send a note FAO the friends' secretary via the library.

Nominations must be submitted by Wednesday 3 July.
