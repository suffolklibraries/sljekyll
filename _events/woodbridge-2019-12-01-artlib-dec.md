The Blaxhall Art Group is a small friendly group of people who meet to paint/draw on a Thursday from 10.30am - 12.30pm at Blaxhall Village Hall. Occasionally a visiting artist is invited to conduct a workshop or demonstration for the group. These paintings are a sample of the groupâ€™s work.

For further information about the group contact Joyce Iszard on [01728 688452](tel:01728688452).
