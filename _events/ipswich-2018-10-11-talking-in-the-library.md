Join us for [Quirkhouse Theatre Company](http://www.quirkhousetheatreco.com/)'s moving exploration of literature, literacy and life, set in the library where four disparate characters meet.

> "Full of touching observations and warm humour, with an abundance of clever parallels to famous literary pieces, making it a real treat for theatre and literary fans to unpick." (<cite>Broadway Baby</cite>)

Written by Jackie Carreira. Part of the Library Fundraising and Literacy Awareness Tour.
