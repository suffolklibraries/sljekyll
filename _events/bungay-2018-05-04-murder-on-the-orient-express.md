Join us at Bungay Community Centre for a screening of <cite>Murder on the Orient Express</cite>:

> "When notorious gangster Ratchett (Johnny Depp) is murdered on a luxurious train ride through Europe, Detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) must solve the case before another victim is claimed by one of the 13 mysterious passengers on board. Among the suspects are Princess Dragomiroff (Judi Dench), Pilar Estravados (Penélope Cruz), a devout missionary, and Mrs Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), an American widow. Can Poirot identify the killer before another life is taken?"

Tickets available in advance from the library (£5) or on the door (£6). Event organised by and to raise funds for Bungay Community Centre and Bungay Library.
