All are welcome to join us for Halesworth's annual mini-festival of light.

From 4:30-5pm, Oxblood Molly will be dancing at the library - you might even get a chance to join in!

From 5-6pm, the Mollies will lead a lantern-lit procession to the Green for a magical final event. Bring a light or [your lantern](/events/halesworth-2018-02-14-lantern-making/) and a hot drink and wear warm clothes and sturdy shoes. Don't worry though - it's hard surfaces all the way.
