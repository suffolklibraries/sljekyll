Join our TopTime group to welcome local author Margaret Moore to discuss writing and her two very different publications - <cite>Almost Full Circle</cite>, a novel set in London's East End in wartime Britain and <cite>The Big Book of Poems for Little People</cite>, a beautifully illustrated book of children's poetry influenced by her own grandchildren.
