Vote for Voices for Gainsborough Community Library (V4GCL) to receive a £4,000, £2,000 or £1,000 cash grant to offer additional community activities during the 2018 summer holidays at Tesco stores in Ipswich.

In association with Groundwork, Tesco awards money raised from carrier bag sales to local community projects. V4GCL is one of three local groups shortlisted to receive a grant during November and December.
