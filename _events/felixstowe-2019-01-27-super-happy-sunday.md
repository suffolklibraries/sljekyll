Join us for some wellbeing and mindfulness activities designed to boost your mood. We have taster Laughter Yoga sessions as well as drop-in activities including adult colouring, jigsaws and board games.

There are two Laughter Yoga sessions, at **10:30-11:30am** and **1:30-2:30pm**. These are free but **must be booked in advance** by contacting the library. Please be aware that this is not suitable if you have epilepsy or severe stomach problems.
