Come along to this special [Sporting Memories](/events-activities/sporting-memories/) session with speedway superfan Pete Rout. Pete has spent a lifetime following speedway and over the past few years has been lovingly crafting reproduction race jackets for the National Speedway Museum among others.

Pete will be bringing some of his extensive collection of speedway memorabilia for you to look at and and talk about. You are encouraged to share your own speedway stories and memorabilia.

Contact the library for more information.
