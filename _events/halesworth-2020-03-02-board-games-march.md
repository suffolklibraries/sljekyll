**Please note one-off date change - session will continue to be on last Monday of the month**

Come along and celebrate the fifth anniversary of our monthly board games café! Play an old favourite or try something new, with over 40 board and card games to choose from.

Price includes refreshments and a raffle ticket.

The library is otherwise closed, so ring the doorbell if the door doesn't open automatically.
