In the spring of 1648, the apprentices of Bury St Edmunds erected a maypole in the market place, a rebellious act since May Day revels had been banned since 1644. The solid Puritan burghers of Bury St Edmunds ordered it to be taken down, thereby provoking a major riot.

However, this disturbance was more than a defence of Merry England - it was merely a cloak for a well-laid royalist insurrection in favour of the imprisoned Charles I. Colonel Tom Blague of Horringer was its informing genius.

John will also be discussing the pro-Christmas riot in Bury St Edmunds in December 1647, a response to the abolition of Christmas in 1645.
