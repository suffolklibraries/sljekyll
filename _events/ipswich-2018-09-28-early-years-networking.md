Artists and early years professionals working with under fives are invited to meet others, hear inspirational speakers and find out more about ACORN East, a network for everyone working creatively with young children.

The afternoon will include a talk from Lil Newton, headteacher of Highfields Nursery, Ipswich, a progessive teaching nursery with an innovative story curriculum. There will also be a practical session from Wonderful Beast, a theatre company that specialises in immersive theatre for 0-3 year-olds and their parents/carers, dramatising stories which ignite our sense of magic and wonder.
