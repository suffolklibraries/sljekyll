11+ year-olds are invited to have a go at making some professional quality music with the GarageBand app. Test out a jaw-dropping array of realistic amps and effects, create astonishingly human-sounding drum tracks and try making your own song by choosing from thousands of loops across all genres.

Spaces are limited to 10, so book in advance by contacting the library. Please bring your own headphones/earphones.

This project is part of our [BLOC youth arts programme](/bloc/).
