This panel event will be a rare opportunity to meet three award-winning children’s authors, each writing for a different age group. It will be of particular interest to those wanting to write for children and young people as well as to those (parents, grandparents, teachers, librarians) who choose books for children to read.

There will be a Q and A session and a display of artwork as well as the opportunity to buy signed copies of the authors’ books.

[Gillian McClure](https://www.gillianmcclure.com/) is Royal Literary Fund Fellow and has been Highly Commended in the Kate Greenaway medal. She writes and illustrates picture books for 2–6 year olds and shows how she marries word, image and typography into the narrative.

[Pippa Goodhart](http://www.pippagoodhart.co.uk/) is the million-selling author of the You Choose and Winnie the Witch series. She writes for 7-9 year-olds and talks about nurturing the reading habit of the newly independent young reader, not only through strong relevant stories but also by building series featuring well-loved characters.

[Rosemary Hayes](http://www.rosemaryhayes.co.uk/) many of whose books for young adults have won or been shortlisted for awards, speaks of the challenges in writing books for this age group and how she chooses storylines to which they can relate, whether contemporary or historical, with enough jeopardy and action to keep them interested.
