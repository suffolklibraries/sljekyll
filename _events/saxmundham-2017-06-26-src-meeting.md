Would you like to volunteer in the library for our [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/)?

At this meeting you will be able to sign the relevant paperwork and see the resources that we will give to the children as they read their 6 books over the course of the summer. If you haven't already [signed up online for the Summer Reading Challenge](/events-activities/summer-reading-challenge/summer-reading-challenge-volunteer-application-form/), we can take your details at the meeting.

If you would like to help but can't go to the meeting, please contact the library.
