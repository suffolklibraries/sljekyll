Carolyn Belcher will discuss her new book <cite>The Pavements We Walk On</cite> and her writing style.

## About The Pavements We Walk On

Maggie enjoys a mixed childhood of escapism with her friends, and the love of her father, coupled with her mother, Edith’s, obvious favouritism towards her younger brother, and the natural jealousy which arises from that.

As she grows up, she discovers a world of freedom from Edith’s rules and marries Trevor, who she believes shares her ideals and values. However, the birth of their son brings unexpected and unwelcome changes to their relationship, which leave Maggie re-evaluating her life.

This novel features the same characters as those in Carolyn Belcher’s debut novel, <cite>Crocodiles and Angels</cite>. Here, she shows how we all tread similar paths, but with differing experiences, and how love and life affect our decisions.

**Tickets &pound;5 available from the library.**
