All are welcome to have fun and help us raise funds for the library service on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) at our sponsored singalong on Ipswich Cornhill with special guest musician Aga Serugo-Lugo. There will also be cakes on sale.

Feeling organised? Pick up a sponsor form in advance from the library.
