Following on from their successful [discussion of <cite>The Uninhabitable Earth</cite>](/events/woodbridge-2019-05-10-uninhabitable-earth/), join Transition Woodbridge and Greener Rendlesham for short presentations on the major themes of [<cite>There is No Planet B: a handbook for the make or break years</cite>, by Mike Berners-Lee](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2512708) and a discussion of how we can address them.

You don't have to have read the book, and there will be refreshments.
