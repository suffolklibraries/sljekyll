Girls aged 8-18 are invited to our usual Girls' Group session for a special Pyre Parade workshop with Pacitti company! Join two artists in designing and making costumes for the parade.

The Pyre Parade is a large-scale free community event inviting people to share and burn bad news. Participants will walk through the streets, from the Think Tank to a secret burn location near the Waterfront, wearing masks and burning herbs, before burning bad news inside a large sculpted icon. It starts at 6pm on Saturday 26 October at The Think Tank, on the High Street next to Ipswich Museum.
