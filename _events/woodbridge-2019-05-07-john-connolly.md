Bestselling crime writer John Connolly will be at the library discussing literature and storytelling with journalist Catherine Larner.

The hugely entertaining Irish writer, the author of 20 novels, is best known for his Charlie Parker mysteries.

While John was drawn to the American crime tradition to explore issues of compassion, morality, reparation and salvation, this new mystery brings Charlie Parker to the UK for the first time, and to East Anglia!

> "On a lonely moor in the northeast of England, the body of a young woman is discovered near the site of a vanished church. In the south, a girl lies buried beneath a Saxon mound. To the southeast, the ruins of a priory hide a human skull. Each is a sacrifice, a summons. And something in the shadows has heard the call.

> "But another is coming: Parker the hunter, the avenger. From the forests of Maine to the deserts of the Mexican border, from the canals of Amsterdam to the streets of London, he will track those who would cast this world into darkness."
