Felixstowe Book Festival and Felixstowe Library present... Harry Potter Book Night!

Do you dream of sipping butterbeer in Hogsmeade, playing quidditch or catching a few fantastic beasts? Are you awaiting the day a special letter will arrive welcoming you to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?

Then come join us to celebrate all things Harry Potter!

The train leaves Platform 9&frac34; (aka Felixstowe Library) for an evening of storytelling and magical activities as we celebrate everybody's favourite boy wizard. We'll be joined by characters from the books and you are invited to wear your best robes for the occasion.

This event is recommended for ages 7+ with all children accompanied by an adult (not required to have a ticket themselves and we will allow entry to muggles). You may want to bring some money to spend in Flourish and Blotts.

Please visit the [Felixstowe Book Festival website](http://www.felixstowebookfestival.co.uk), ring [01394 694880](tel:01394694880) or send an owl to Felixstowe Library for more info. Tickets sold out very quickly last year so hop on your Firebolt and whizz down to Felixstowe Library before theyâ€™re all gone!
