Computer scientist and CEO of Rainbird Ben Taylor will be talking about the future of Artificial Intelligence and what it means for our society.

Ben first studied Artificial Intelligence in the late 90s. After completing his degree, he went on to specialise in expert system technology in the digital publishing market. He created algorithms for digital layout and innovated new ways of optimising printing workflow.

He joined Adobe as a computer scientist in 2004 where he worked on Adobe Acrobat and the PDF format, focusing specifically on developing high-speed Raster Image-Processing.

He then joined a start-up transforming the motor insurance industry using AI. As Director of Technology Ben led the technical development of an award-winning AI system which became a market leader in the motor claims arena. His experience of the complexities involved in capturing human expertise in software lead him to prototype Rainbird.

Rainbird, "an Artificial Intelligence platform that can model human-like cognitive reasoning processes, and deploy them at scale," was accepted by the prestigious Techstars business accelerator in 2014 and is now working with the world's largest enterprises tackling some of their biggest problems.

Ben has recently served as government scientific adviser, to specifically address the some of the issues in this talk.

There will be wine and nibbles available and a chance to ask questions.

All finds raised will go to the library.
