Join us for a dramatised reading, with music, of <cite>Pilgrim: the search for lost love</cite>:

> "A folk tale of an everyman abandoned by his true-love. At its heart is the idea of love as a journey, not a possession. It is a pilgrimage to the Eden of True-love’s garden. Pilgrim encounters False-love, the celebrity Fairy Queen, and his own destructive other self. Constantly challenged, he endures until finally united with True-love."

The performance celebrates the story and its possibilities through references that are timeless, yet contemporary. Truth and lies cross each other in stories of what we want, and what we believe can make us whole, or give us meaning. <cite>Pilgrim</cite> is a broken love story, redeemed by love.

Contact the library to book your tickets. Drinks available for purchase on the night.

Narrator: Jamie Symons
Pilgrim: Huw Brentnall
Grimlip: Richard Bates
