This World Mental Health Day, pop into the library for free tea and cake and chat to stallholders from various organisations including Julian Support and our very own Time To Change Champions group, the Caterpillars.

If you have questions about mental health and/or want to find out more about what support is available to you or someone you know, come along and join us.
