2-6 year-olds are invited to a free drop-in arts and crafts session with Imagine That Publishing. Expect lots of great Arty Mouse-themed stamping, sticking, painting, colouring, tracing and stencilling activities.

All arts and craft materials are provided free of charge, and there will be a free prize draw entry for all children who complete an activity.
