Last year David presented the football referee’s exam paper. This year he returns with explanations, interpretations and his experiences of upholding the laws of the game. Join us in our regular [Sporting Memories](/events-activities/sporting-memories/) session for what promises to be a lively discussion without the exam or VAR!

No need to book, just come along to the Lecture Hall on the first floor of the library.
