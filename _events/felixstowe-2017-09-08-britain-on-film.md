Join us and Creative Arts East for a screening of three archive films on coastal life in Suffolk and Norfolk:

* <cite>Beside the Seaside</cite>, a moving history of seaside resorts, featuring sea, sand, piers and proms
* <cite>For Those in Peril</cite>, a film about risk and rescue, lifeboats and lightships, narrated by late Anglia TV presenter Dick Joice
* <cite>Gone Fishing</cite> a pictorial history of the many facets of fishing on the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts from documentary maker John Grierson.

Each film runs for approximately 20 minutes and will be introduced by local TV presenter and archive enthusiast Eddie Anderson.
