Are you a carer, supporter or friend of someone with mental ill-health?  Would you like:

* Advice on your rights?
* Access to practical information to help you with your caring role?
* Information on where to get help in a crisis?
* Advice on how to support your loved one?
* An assessment of your needs to find out what support is available?

Come along during the library's regular Open Space session to talk to the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust about how they can help.
