Come and see some of the beautiful specimens produced by members of the Woodbridge Horticultural Society.

Founded in 1852, the Society is affiliated to The Royal Horticultural Society and Suffolk Horticultural & Produce Association. Its aim is to provide informative and entertaining presentations on a wide range of gardening topics. In addition, its programme of events includes outings to fine gardens and houses, coffee mornings in membersâ€™ gardens and sometimes a strawberry tea.

Every year, on a weekend in early July, the Society stages the Woodbridge Flower Show. This is the opportunity for members and non-members to enter some 150 classes ranging from flowers, vegetables and fruit to home baking, photography and handicrafts. After the judging the show is open to the public.

Woodbridge Horticultural Society also hosts the biannual Spring Lecture by a well known gardening celebrity. Past speakers have included Alys Fowler, Pippa Greenwood, Joe Swift, Bunny Guinness, Nigel Colbourne and Roy Lancaster.
