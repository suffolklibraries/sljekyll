**In this, the 30th year since the publication of her bestselling debut <cite>Lady of Hay</cite>, novelist Barbara Erskine will be talking about her career, her inspiration and her latest novel <cite>Sleeper’s Castle</cite>.**

Known for weaving history and the supernatural with compelling stories, in this her 14th novel, Barbara Erskine has revisited the scenes and characters from the book which first made her name.

The location is Hay-On-Wye in the year 1400. War is brewing in the Welsh borders as it looks like the charismatic Owain Glyndwr may bring his people to independence from the English. Catrin is on the brink of womanhood and falling in love for the first time. Finding herself caught in the middle of a doomed war, she is called upon to foretell Wales’s destiny.

Fast forward to Hay in 2015. Miranda has moved to Sleeper’s Castle to escape and grieve. Slowly she feels herself coming to life in the solitude of the mountains, but every time she closes her eyes her dreams become more vivid. And she makes a connection with a young girl, who’s screaming, who’s reaching out… who only Miranda can help. Is she losing herself to time?

Barbara is a delightful speaker and has a strong following. She used to live in Suffolk, and set her book <cite>River of Destiny</cite> in Woodbridge. If you’re already a fan or want to find out why her books are so compelling, come along to meet her at the library this evening.

Tickets are £6 and a bar will be available serving refreshments. Barbara will be pleased to sign copies of any of her books from 8.30pm and titles will be available for purchase on the night. Doors open from 7pm.
