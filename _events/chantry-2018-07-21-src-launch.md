**The library will be closed for lunch between 1pm and 2pm**

Drop in to the library to sign up for this year's [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/), find Dennis' missing friends, toys and objects, try his catapult competition, make Gnasher out of pom-poms, and enjoy colouring and puzzles.

Dressing up as your favourite cartoon character is encouraged and the Friends of Chantry Library will be providing refreshments.
