A.F. Harrold is well known for his lively and unexpected performances. He's the author of the <cite>Fizzlebert Stump</cite> series, as well as [<cite>The Imaginary</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1852363) and [<cite>The Song From Somewhere Else</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1998149).

He lives in Reading with a stand-up comedian and two cats, but won’t be bringing any of them to the children's section at Felixstowe Library. It’ll just be him, some books and a bit of shouting.

Under 12s must be accompanied by an adult.
