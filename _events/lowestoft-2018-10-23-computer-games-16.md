Plan, design and create a game within a short span of time. Weâ€™re looking for musicians, game designers, artists or writers to work in a team, respond to a theme and make a game!

Laptops will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their own computer, albeit at their own risk.

If you take part in this workshop, you can collect a free food voucher for Sam's Coffee House!

No need to book.
