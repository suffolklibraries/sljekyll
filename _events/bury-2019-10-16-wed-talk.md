The [Irving Stage Company](http://www.irvingstagecompany.co.uk/) is one of the oldest theatre groups in Suffolk and celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2019. It was formed in 1959 as The Irving Club by a group of enthusiasts anxious to present high quality theatre. The Company now performs primarily at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds – the country's only surviving working Regency playhouse, which marks its 200th anniversary in 2019.
