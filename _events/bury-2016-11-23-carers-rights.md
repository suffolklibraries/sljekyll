Ahead of Carers' Rights Day on 25 November, Marion Robbins, Carers' Lead with Bury North Integrated Delivery Team (IDT) and Julie Williams from Bury South IDT will be promoting carers' rights at the library's Open Space session.

Find out about the financial and practical help available to carers, as well as more general rights such as independence, being part of the local community and having time to oneself.

Marion Robbins and Julie Williams work for the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT)
