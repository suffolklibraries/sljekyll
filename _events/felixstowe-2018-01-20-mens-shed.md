Drop in and find out about the new Men's Shed group that's starting up in Undercliff Road West, Felixstowe.

Men's Sheds are community spaces for men to connect, converse and create. The activities are often similar to those of garden sheds, but for groups of men to enjoy together while staving off loneliness and isolation.
