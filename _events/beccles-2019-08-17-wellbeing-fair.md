Do you want to learn more about how you can support your physical, mental and emotional health? Would you like to broaden your horizons and explore new wellness practices and therapies?

This is the event for you! We will be coming together to bring you an array of therapies, products and services to support you and the community.

This is a free event, but we would really appreciate it if you could donate an unopened item for [The Hygiene Bank](https://www.thehygienebank.com/products-we-collect?fbclid=IwAR1_ADRXfG92HhOAtdURdXZ0gM39CdOLfdSpHh4moNjBW5McYjx4FR_2ROI).
