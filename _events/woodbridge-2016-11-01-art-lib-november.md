The exhibition is a response to the natural world and our sometimes difficult relationship with it. Using her unique blend of figurative and abstract elements, Laura explores Suffolk’s rich flora and fauna and the ways that people make an impact on the local environment.

Having grown up in Elmsett, near Hadleigh, Laura studied art and history of art at the Winchester School of Art in Hampshire, followed by a Master's degree in contemporary art, criticism and philosophy at the University of Essex. After returning to her home county of Suffolk, Laura has continued her art practice and has been influenced by the natural world, often exploring environmental themes too.

Laura says: “As an artist you’re always fascinated by what’s happening in the world around you - and I try to make sense of that through art. My work looks at how we interact with other creatures and the environment around us. I have always been enchanted by the local landscape. The natural world plays an important part in my paintings and I think it can tell us something about ourselves too.”

Laura’s paintings also investigate the relationship between figurative and abstract elements. The result is often something that at first glance looks easily recognisable but, on reflection, is playful and questioning.
