Set in the nineteenth century, Oscar Wilde's <cite>A Woman of No Importance</cite> follows a group of guests at party at Lady Hunstanton's estate in the lavish English countryside. The party's guests, which include the widow Mrs Arbuthnot, her son Gerald and American outsider Hester, uncover truths about themselves and each other that will alter their lives forever.

Wilde's story explores class, family and double standards towards women as the guests grapple with unexpected visitors, their selfish actions and intentions. The play tackles the themes of money, which, as aristocrats, they consider an unlimited resource, and the innocence of the play's younger characters.

From the 2017 production at Vaudeville Theatre in London’s West End.
