Come and see <cite>Sing</cite> at the library:

> "Dapper Koala Buster Moon presides over a once-grand theatre that has fallen on hard times. An eternal optimist, and a bit of a scoundrel, he loves his theatre above all and will do anything to preserve it. Facing the crumbling of his life's ambition, he takes one final chance to restore his fading jewel to its former glory by producing the world's greatest singing competition. Five contestants emerge: a mouse, a timid elephant, a pig, a gorilla and a punk-rock porcupine."
