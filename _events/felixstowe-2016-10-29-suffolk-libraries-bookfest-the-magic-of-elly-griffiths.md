If you thought crime was a dark and sinister subject, think again. Elly Griffiths is warm, funny, charming and very entertaining, and this special event to launch her new book is not to be missed.

<cite>The Blood Card</cite> is the third in the Stephens and Mephisto series of books. These mysteries are all set around magicians performing on the south coast in the 1950s, uncovering secrets, lies and crimes.

Elly's publisher has brought forward the release of this title, so that it could be launched in our Bookfest at Felixstowe Library and we've put together a very special evening to mark the occasion.

There will be a 50s theme to the proceedings, and we have enlisted the help of local magician Mr Bean to show us some intriguing tricks and sleight of hand, themed round Elly’s characters and the world of books.

Mr Bean will be performing as guests arrive when doors open at 7pm. There will be a cash bar available for refreshments.

At 7.30pm Elly will talk to us about her books and career. There’ll be time for questions before we line up to buy Elly’s new book, hot off the press. While we wait for Elly to sign these first editions, Mr Bean will once again baffle and delight us with his tricks and illusions.

It’s going to be a magical evening!
