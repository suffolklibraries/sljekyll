Do you have a child/young person with additional needs and/or disabilities? Drop in to talk to SPCN Ambassadors about your experiences of education, health and/or care services in Suffolk, and find out about the resources and events SPCN offer and how you can get involved.

SPCN works closely alongside its strategic partners Suffolk Family Carers, Healthwatch and Suffolk User Forum to ensure the Mental Health Transformation Plan is co-produced, views and experiences are listened to, and that future proposals are shared across Suffolk for everyone to see. The next phase of this consultation is due to be released shortly they would like to hear your views.
