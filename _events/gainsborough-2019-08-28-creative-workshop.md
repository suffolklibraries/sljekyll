We're launching [BLOC - Building Libraries on ](/bloc/) at Gainsborough Community Library with two creative workshops for 11+ year-olds with brilliant songwriter, musician and composer Aga Serugo-Lugo. Have a go at creating writing, songwriting, music and singing!

Refreshments provided.

This session must be booked in advance by contacting the library as spaces are limited.

The other workshop is on [28 August](/events/gainsborough-2019-08-28-creative-workshop/) - you can come to either or both!
