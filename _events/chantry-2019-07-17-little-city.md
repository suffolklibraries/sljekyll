Toddlers and pre-schoolers who love to role play are invited to our Little City event! Try out a purpose-designed little street where you can be whatever you like - firefighter, police officer, shopkeeper, chef, hairdresser, superhero - the only limit is your imagination!

Advance booking by contacting the library is essential.
