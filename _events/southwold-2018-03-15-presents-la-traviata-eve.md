Violetta Valéry is a well-known courtesan in Paris whose life appears to be glamorous. However, she's suffering from a serious illness and living on the money given to her by her male patrons. When she meets Alfredo Germont, a young man from a good family, though, they fall in love and move to the country.

However, Alfredo's father disapproves of their relationship and persuades Violeta to return to Paris. Will Alfredo learn the truth and return to Violetta before it's too late?

Tickets available from the library and Southwold Arts Centre.
