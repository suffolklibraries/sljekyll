Pre-school children and their parents/carers are invited to a special workshop with early years music leader Claire Henry and musicians from the City of London Sinfonia.

This workshop offers young children the opportunity to be at the heart of a musical puzzle in an exploration of shapes, puzzles and music. Claire works as a team with the children to complete challenges and celebrate the success of their music quest. Expect musical games, storytelling, singing, clapping and moving to music!

No musical experience is required and parents and carers are encouraged to join in!
