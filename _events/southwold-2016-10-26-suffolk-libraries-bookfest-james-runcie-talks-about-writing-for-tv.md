**The creator of <cite>The Grantchester Mysteries</cite>, James Runcie will talk to TV presenter and author Paul Heiney about how his novels have been turned into the hugely successful ITV drama series.**

James Runcie is an accomplished documentary and film maker, a playwright and author of several novels. A few years ago, he decided he wanted to write a series of books which would reach a wider audience than his standalone novels had previously achieved. They would have a lighter feel, but have great characterisation, an attractive setting and raise social and moral issues in an entertaining but thoughtful way. The books would be inspired by the life of his father, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.

James conceived <cite>The Grantchester Mysteries</cite>. This series of six books would follow a young vicar, Sidney Chambers as he stumbled across crimes, his curiosity leading him to be drawn into working alongside the Cambridgeshire police. Each book would follow a decade of Sidney’s life and career from the 1950s to the present day, and would be divided into six episodes. It was perfect for a television adaptation!

There have been two series of Grantchester on ITV boasting a stunning cast of actors and beautiful, atmospheric locations. They have been hugely popular but the story has veered away from that originally intended by James, and pursued in the five novels currently published.

He will talk to Paul Heiney about the rewards and frustrations of seeing your work presented on television, and together they will explore the changing nature of the medium. Is the audience being patronised? Are we seeing too much dumbing down? What makes a successful drama? Where is the innovation and creativity in TV drama?

Paul Heiney has worked in TV and radio for 40 years, known particularly for his involvement with <cite>That's Life</cite>, <cite>Watchdog</cite> and <cite>Countrywise</cite>. A keen sailor, he has written about his solo trips across the Atlantic, most recently in the stunning book <cite>One Wild Song</cite>.

This will be a fascinating discussion between two entertaining and vastly experienced professionals, and they will use clips from the television series to illustrate their debate. It will appeal to media students and film buffs as well as fans of Grantchester on television and in print. You’ll come away inspired, challenged and uplifted!

Refreshments will be available.
