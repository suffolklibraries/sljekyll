Attracting millions of viewers, <cite>Grantchester</cite> saw actors James Norton and Robson Green playing the priest-detective Sidney Chambers and police officer Geordie as they tackled crime in 1960s Cambridge.

The hit tv drama which is due for a third series in early 2017, has drawn on the ideas and characters devised by James Runcie.

James is an award-winning film director, novelist and playwright and he is the son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie whose life and experiences, James says he has drawn on for the books.

There are now four volumes of stories about Sidney Chambers and the latest, <cite>Sidney Chambers and The Dangers of Temptation</cite> will be introduced in this every special afternoon event.

Canon Sidney Chambers is now working in Ely, and married with a young daughter but is still being drawn back to Cambridge to help with the investigations of his good friend Geordie.

The stories are beautifully written, funny at times and moving at others. They are thoughtful and thought-provoking as Sidney ponders moral and ethical dilemmas as well as personal predicaments.
