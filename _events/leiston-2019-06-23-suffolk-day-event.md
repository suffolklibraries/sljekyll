Get creative at Leiston Library to celebrate Suffolk Day, in association with Leiston Good Neighbour Scheme. Enjoy arts and crafts for all ages, help us put together a jigsaw and have some coffee and cake.

We will also be reading out the winning entry from our [short story competition](/events/leiston-2019-05-31-suffolk-day-competition/)!
