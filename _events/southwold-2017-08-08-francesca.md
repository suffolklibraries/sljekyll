Children's author (and Suffolk librarian!) Francesca will be signing her new book [<cite>Fenn Halflin and the Seaborn</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2167085), the sequel to last year's [<cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1977471).

The books are set in a Suffolk-inspired futuristic flooded world. They follow the adventures of the hero Fenn Halflin and touch on the very topical themes of immigration and the environment.

Please book in advance by contacting the library.
