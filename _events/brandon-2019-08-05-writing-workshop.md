Brandon Library Poets present a poetry and writing workshop by poet Diane Jackman ahead of the [Tales and Trails Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/brandon-country-park/tales-and-trails-festival/1110626802470447/). Come along and create some poetry and prose focussing on the people who shaped Brandon Country Park's history and the diverse variety of trees that enrich the park.

In a collaboration with Brandon Arts Society and local photographers, finished work will be submitted to show and perform in The Engine House. We are also writing to perform along story trails at the event. We would love you to join us to take part or find out how you could get involved in the exhibition!
