Are you interested in researching your family history? Perhaps you've made some progress but got stuck? Has the WWI centenary inspired you to find out about your ancestors who were involved in the war?

Drop in to our open day for help and advice from members of Suffolk Family History Society. You can also learn how to access Findmypast and Ancestry through the library.

Professional genealogist Karen Cummings will also be in attendance.
