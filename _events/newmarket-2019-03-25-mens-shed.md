Are you retired and looking for something to do? Are you looking to keep using your skills, such as woodworking, carpentry or metalwork?

We're looking at setting up a Men's Shed in the Newmarket community. If you're interested in getting involved, please register your interest by contacting the library by Friday 12 April.
