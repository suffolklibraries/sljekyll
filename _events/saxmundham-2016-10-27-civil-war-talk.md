Novelist David Ebsworth will be talking about the Spanish civil war, where his novels are set, and writing.  

What was the Spanish Civil War all about? Why is it still important? How has it been portrayed in popular literature? What are some of the local connections? What was the peculiar role of the British Government? And why does he keep writing about it?
