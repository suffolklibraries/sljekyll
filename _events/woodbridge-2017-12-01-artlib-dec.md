Karen and Roger Mead are holding their second exhibition of paintings in Woodbridge Library as part of the ArtLib series of events.

They have a cottage in Woodbridge and are both painters in watercolours, oils, pastels and ink. After their first exhibition in the library of purely Suffolk scenes, they decided that this exhibition would be a mixture of subjects, in all media, again in the traditional manner.  

All paintings will be for sale.
