Join us at our regular Top Time session for a talk from author Michelle Hockley.

Set in the seventeenth century against a backdrop of civil and domestic unrest, Michelle Hockley's novel [<cite>Before Spring Came Summer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2600259) is based on true events, telling the story of the extraordinary life of Jane Whorwood (1612-1684), a close companion of Charles I and the Royal Court.

Michelle first encountered Jane in the British Library when she was invited by Hampton Court Palace to investigate why Charles I escaped the Army in 1647 and to identify the route taken. She later became a senior early modern record specialist at The National Archives, and amongst a plethora of government documents, Jane appeared again, leading Michelle to realise that Jane's life was undoubtedly interesting over and beyond her bravery and loyalty towards her king.

Michelle will be wearing authentic seventeenth century costume and signing copies of her books.
