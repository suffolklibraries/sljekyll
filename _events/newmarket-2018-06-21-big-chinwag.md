Drop in to the library for tea, cake and chat in aid of Age UK Suffolk this Suffolk Day. Help raise money for vital services for older people that prevent loneliness and isolation in later life.

We're also holding a guess the weight of the cake competition for Age UK Suffolk. Enter your guess for Â£1 for the opportunity to win a cake, kindly donated by Newmarket Tesco.

New and nearly new books will be available to buy, with proceeds being split between the library and Age UK Suffolk.
