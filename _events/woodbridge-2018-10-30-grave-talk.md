For many years, the western world has been reluctant to talk about death, but a recent shift in attitude has prompted people to begin tackling the silence around this subject, encouraging an awareness of death as being part of everyone’s life.

GraveTalk has been specially developed to help local churches host a café space to talk about death, dying and funerals. Conversation is prompted by questions provided on a set of cards and people of all faiths and none can talk very naturally and freely drawing on their own experiences. A facilitator looks after each small group and everyone’s views are respected.

All welcome. Tea, coffee and cake provided.

For more information, call GraveTalk on [01394388820](tel:01394388820).
