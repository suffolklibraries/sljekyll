## About Sandlands

The sixteen short stories in this collection are all set in and around the village of Blaxhall in coastal Suffolk. From the white doe appearing through the dark wood to the blue-winged butterflies rising as a cloud in reminder of happier times, the creatures of the Suffolk landscape flit and flicker through the tales.

Through the landscape and its wildlife, through human and folk memory, the past is linked to the present and generations of lives are intertwined.

Tickets free, all welcome.
