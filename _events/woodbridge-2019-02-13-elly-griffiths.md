Bestselling author Elly Griffiths will be at the library discussing her latest Dr Ruth Galloway book with journalist Catherine Larner.

<cite>The Stone Circle</cite> is the 11th book and fans of the series will be eager to learn of the latest development in the relationship between Ruth Galloway and DCI Nelson. For those new to Elly's books, there's no need to start at the beginning, because each novel stands alone - though once you've tried them, you WILL want to read all of them!

In <cite>The Stone Circle</cite>, Ruth Galloway and DCI Nelson are forced to think back to when they met as they are both reminded of their first case, recounted in <cite>The Crossing Places</cite>. Nelson receives anonymous letters that seem strangely familiar, and Ruth working on a dig in the Saltmarsh uncovers bones of a 12-year-old girl who disappeared 30 years ago, and learns of events resembling that of Scarlett Henderson, the girl Nelson couldn't save. The past is reaching out for Ruth and Nelson, and its grip is deadly...

Elly is a fabulous speaker as well as a terrific crime writer, with a wicked sense of humour. Don't miss this opportunity to meet her!
