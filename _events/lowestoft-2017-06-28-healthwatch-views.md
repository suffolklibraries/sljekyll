The Care Quality Commission regulates health and care services to make sure they are meeting standards of quality and safety. Their inspectors would like to hear about mental health service users and carers' experiences of using Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) mental health services, big or small, positive or negative.

The inspectors are particularly interested to meet with patients who have recently been discharged and are being supported to recover within the community, perhaps with the support of a care co-ordinator or other forms of home support.

Your views will help form the findings of their inspection of the NSFT, due to take place from 10-17 July.

If you are interested in attending this session, please call Healthwatch Suffolk on [01449 703949](tel:01449703949) or email info@healthwatchsuffolk.co.uk
