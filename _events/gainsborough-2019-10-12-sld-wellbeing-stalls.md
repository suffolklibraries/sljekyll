Make some time for you while raising funds for the library service on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) with our wellbeing event. Try reflexology, get a Henna tattoo, have a Tarot reading, enjoy some tasty treats and more.

We still have some stalls available at a cost of Â£10 and a prize for our raffle.

There will also be the chance to win prizes in our raffle.
