Don Quixote was originally created by master choreographer Marius Petipa, together with the Austrian composer Ludwig Minkus, for the Imperial Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow in 1869. Marking the 400th anniversary of Miguel de Cervantes’s death, Don Quixote is presented in the revised version by Nureyev, which Manuel Legris, director of Vienna State Ballet, devised specially for the Wiener Staatsballett.

The opening night in 2011 at the Vienna State Opera was an extraordinary evening and a resounding success for both the Company and the Opera House. The vitality, the virtuosity and vivaciousness of this ballet classic was felt by all, both on and off the stage. Journalists and critics praised the two principals, Maria Yakovleva and Denys Cherevychko, Kitri and Basil respectively. Both dancers dazzled technically and thrilled the audience as enamoured lovers.

Experience the story of a world-famous ballet-classic played by the Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera - conducted by Kevin Rhodes - and marvellous dancers.
