Bring your teddy to the library for our special Paddington event. Enjoy a craft activity, guess the secret word, spin the wheel, tombola and raffle as well as refreshments and teddy bear biscuits.

We will also be reopening our newly refurbished comfy corner, with thanks to Rushmere St Andrew Parish Council and Anglia Research.
