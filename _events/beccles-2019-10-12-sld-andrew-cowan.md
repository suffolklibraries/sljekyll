Join us on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) for the chance to meet author Andrew Cowan and hear about the art of writing and his latest book, [<cite>Your Fault</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2545044):

> "Set in a 1960s English new town, <cite>Your Fault</cite> charts one boy's childhood from first memory to first love. A year older in each chapter, Peter's story is told to him by his future self as he attempts to recreate the optimism and futurism of the 1960s, and to reveal how that utopianism fares as it emerges into the Seventies. It's an untold story of British working class experience, written with extraordinary precision and tenderness."
