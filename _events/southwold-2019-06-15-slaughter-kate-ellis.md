Kate was born and brought up in Liverpool and studied drama in Manchester. After a variety of jobs, none of which she particularly enjoyed, she discovered her vocation was writing crime fiction. She has twice been shortlisted for the CWA Short Story Dagger, and nominated for the Dagger in the Library award. She is married with two grown up sons. You can find out more about her in our [Meet the Author interview](/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-kate-ellis/).
