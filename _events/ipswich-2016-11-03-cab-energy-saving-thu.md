Ipswich Citizens Advice will be at Ipswich County Library to encourage people to cut their energy costs by following a three-step rule: **check, switch and save**.

Visitors will be encouraged to check their current tariff and compare it with other suppliers, before switching to a cheaper deal if available. They will also be given tips on saving energy in their homes.
