Back by popular demand!

Kev F Sutherland writes and draws for <cite>The Beano</cite>, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> and Marvel comics, and now he’ll teach you how easy it is.

At the end of the workshop, you will leave with a comic containing a strip by everyone in the class plus an individual caricature by Kev F.

Learn everything he knows, so you can leave school and steal his job!

Recommended for ages 7+. Accompanying adults do not require a ticket unless participating in the workshop.
