Kieran is a Year 2 Media student specialising in photography. For this exhibition he has decided to show different aspects of Suffolk life, including seaside, nature and portraiture, using the skills he has acquired from Suffolk New College. 

His inspiration for this work is the beauty to be found in nature and the experimental art of photography that means the limit is your imagination.
