Robert Lloyd Parry brings a seasonal shiver to Woodbridge with <cite>Oh Whistle...</cite> -  his retelling of two of the greatest tales by M. R. James, the master of the English ghost story.

Described by <cite>The Stage</cite> as 'story-telling at its finest' and by the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> as 'wonderful, magical', Lloyd Parry of Nunkie Theatre Company has spearheaded The M. R. James Project, an initiative to bring back to life the most entertaining of James’s enduringly brilliant tales. He will perform <cite>Oh Whistle and I’ll Come to You My Lad</cite> and <cite>The Ash Tree</cite>. One review described his performance as 'utterly hypnotic'.

M. R. James was an author, medieval scholar and Fellow of King’s College Cambridge. Many of his stories were written to be performed by candlelight to his friends in his college rooms on Christmas Eve. His [<cite>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=332457) remain the most admired supernatural tales in the English language. <cite>Oh Whistle...</cite> is a tale of nocturnal horror on the Suffolk coast and is considered by many to be James’s masterpiece. <cite>The Ash Tree</cite> is a story of witchcraft and vengeance down the generations.

Ticket price includes an interval drink.
