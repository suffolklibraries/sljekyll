Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy MBE (1952 â€“ 2012) was best known for painting the official Golden Jubilee portrait of HM Queen Elizabeth II and many other portraits, from famous stars to people living on the streets of London, Maputo or New York. Yet her main body of work, completed during the 25 years she lived in Suffolk, covered an exceptionally wide range of landscape, historic, spiritual, emotional and impressionistic work in oils, pastels, etchings, stone-based lithography and sculpture.

This exhibition will showcase just a small portion of her work, much of which will be available for sale. 25% of all sales will be donated to an opera company which Chinwe greatly admired, [Jubilee Opera](http://www.jubileeopera.co.uk), a fantastic organisation based at the Jubilee Hall in Aldeburgh that has provided exceptional experiences to thousands of Suffolk children. Jubilee Opera offers a platform for children in the community to explore an exciting world of music, song and performance, working with professionals on productions of the highest possible quality and standard.
