Help support the library by coming to our annual Christmas Fair.

We have an amazing selection of stalls - pick up some preserves, knitwear, ceramics, handmade cards, jewellery, potted bulbs, fudge and books for Christmas, enjoy refreshments including cake, and try your luck with our raffle and tombola.
