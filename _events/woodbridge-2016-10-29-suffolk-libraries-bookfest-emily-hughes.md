**Author and illustrator, Emily Hughes will teach you how to draw her wild girl character and other creatures of the woods in this fun-filled illustration workshop.**

Emily was born in Hawaii but lives in Britain and has won huge acclaim for her stunning illustrations and imaginative stories.

<cite>Wild</cite> has been described as having echoes of Kipling’s <cite>Jungle Book</cite> and Sendak’s <cite>Where the Wild Things Are</cite>, and tells of a joyful, carefree little girl who is raised by creatures in the forest. She is completely wild, and proud of it! Then one day she is discovered and taken to the city&hellip;

Emily’s second book is equally stunning in its message and its presentation. Called <cite>The Little Gardener</cite> we meet a little man whose garden means everything to him. He works very hard, but he feels he’s just too small to make a difference.

Once again Emily takes us to a world not unlike out own, but still brimming with fantasy and wonder, with powerful and inspiring messages for readers young and old!

Emily is an exciting, energetic and inspiring presenter and this will be a lively and memorable workshop. She will be available to sign copies of her books after the session. Space is limited so please reserve your place early.

Children from five years upwards can attend. Paints and crayons will be used so old clothing or aprons should be worn.
