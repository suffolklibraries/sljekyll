Mediaeval community policing was the basis of Bury St Edmunds' Police Force, which was established in 1836.

Local historian John Saunders will be describing how law and order has since been shaped by structural and societal changes. His talk will provide interesting facts and anecdotes and his personal experiences as a police officer.
