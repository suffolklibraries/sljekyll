0-4 year-olds and their parents/carers are invited to come along in their pyjamas and help us celebrate bedtime stories and raise money for [BookTrust](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/pyjamarama/).

This session runs in place of our [regular Baby Bounce and Tot Rock sessions](/parents-carers-and-children/bookstart-storytime-resources/) on this day.
