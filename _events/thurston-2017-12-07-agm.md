All are welcome to hear what the Friends of Thurston Library have been up to this year, and plan for the year ahead.

This brief meeting will be followed by a talk from Linda Scoles, then cheese and wine.

Please contact Cathy at the library to let us know you will be coming so we can cater for the right number of people.
