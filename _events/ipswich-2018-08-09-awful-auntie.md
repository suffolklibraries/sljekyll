Do you have an 'Awful Auntie' - awfully nice, funny, or just awful?

4-16 year-olds are invited to draw, paint or create a picture of a real or imaginary auntie for the chance to win tickets to David Walliams' <cite>Awful Auntie</cite> at the Regent Theatre. Your picture will also be displayed at the library.

Pictures **must be A4 sized, paper or card**. Hand your entry in to staff at Ipswich County Library with your **name, address and contact number on the back**. The closing date is **12 September 2018** and winners will be chosen after this date.
