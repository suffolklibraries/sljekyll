All are invited to join this discussion of [<cite>Out of the Wreckage: a new politics for an age of crisis</cite>, by George Monbiot](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2260721):

> "What does the good life - and the good society - look like in the 21st century? Mainstream politics is stuck, torn between the redundant doctrines of Keynesianism and neoliberalism. Neither have much to offer a world facing environmental collapse, civic breakdown and a gathering crisis of permanent unemployment. This dismal, managerial politics fails to articulate a vision of a better world, driving people towards the anti-politics offered by Donald Trump and others. What is urgently needed is a positive, propositional vision that can re-engage people in politics.

> "Here, Monbiot seeks out the best new ideas and streamlines them into a coherent, inspiring story that describes the present and shows the way to a better future. He explains how communities can be rebuilt, how economies can be recharged without destroying the living planet and how politics can once more inspire and thrill."

The meeting will be led by Greener Rendlesham and co-hosted by Transition Woodbridge, who propose that increasing local community activity will help address the environmental problems Monbiot discusses.
