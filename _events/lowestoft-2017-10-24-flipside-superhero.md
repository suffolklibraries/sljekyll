Children aged 8+ are invited to explore the basics of how to create graphic characters at this fun workshop.

Get creative with the Flipside Festival theme of 'jungle' and develop a character from scratch: their basic overall design, look, abilities and name.

At the end of the session each child should have a sheet of rough idea designs and a sheet with the 'developed' character.
