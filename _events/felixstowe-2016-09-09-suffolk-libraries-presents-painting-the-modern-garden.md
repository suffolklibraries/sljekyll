Monet to Matisse

"Claude Monet was an avid horticulturist and arguably the most important painter
of gardens in the history of art, but he was not alone. Great artists like
Van Gogh, Bonnard, Sorolla, Sargent, Pissarro and Matisse all saw the garden as
a powerful subject for their art. These great artists, along with many other
famous names, feature in an innovative and extensive exhibition from The
Cleveland Museum of Art and The Royal Academy, London.

From the exhibition walls to the wonder and beauty of artistsâ€™ gardens, take a
magical journey, guided by passionate curators, artists and garden enthusiasts,
to discover how different contemporaries of Monet built and cultivated modern
gardens to explore radical and wonderful new ideas."

            -From The Royal Academy of Arts London & Cleveland Museum of Art
