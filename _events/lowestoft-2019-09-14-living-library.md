Drop in to the library and borrow a 'Living Library Book' - someone who worked in Lowestoft in one of the factories or industries that are no longer part of the town, from the Co-op factory to the Coachworks - for up to half an hour. They'll tell you their story and you can ask them questions.

There will also be refreshments, a trail activity and crafts, as well as information about the local history resources available from the library all year round.

This event is suitable for all ages.
