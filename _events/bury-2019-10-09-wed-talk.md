Local author Rachel Churcher has spent the last two years writing and publishing her young-adult post-Brexit dystopian series, Battle Ground. With mainstream publishers turning away from dystopian fiction, and taking several years to bring a book to publication, Rachel decided to set up her own publishing house, and bring Battle Ground to its intended audience before the Brexit deadline.

With two of the five books already published, Rachel will be talking about the series, and about the obstacles to publication. Self-publishing is not an easy option, and the last year has been a steep learning curve for the author as she has taken on the roles of editor, production manager, social media manager, cover designer, and promotions manager for her books.

Whether you’re a writer thinking about publication, a reader wondering what self-publishing looks like, or a lover of dystopian fiction, this talk will give you an insight into the work that goes into bringing a book to its audience.
