The Friends of the Library in Kessingland (F.O.L.K) invite teams of up to 6 to a quiz night with a difference!

Crime author and Lakenheath Library patron Alison Bruce will be in attendance, calling out the mind-bending questions she has set for us. There will also be half-time refreshments and a tombola.

Contact the library in advance for tickets.
