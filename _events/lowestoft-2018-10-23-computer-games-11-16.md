Draw a scene from your favourite story or book and bring it to life with Scratch coding and MakeyMakey circuit boards! Using conductive materials like tin foil and graphite sticks youâ€™ll trigger sounds and lights through coding on Scratch.

If you take part in this workshop, you can collect a free food voucher for Sam's Coffee House!

No need to book.
