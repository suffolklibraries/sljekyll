Kate Rhodes is one of the original members of the influential crime writing group, Killer Women. She will be talking about her gripping Hell Bay series, featuring troubled DI Ben Kitto.

Kate grew up in Greenwich, in South London. Her first job was as an usherette at a London theatre, where she dreamed of becoming an actor and had the luxury of watching hundreds of plays without having to pay for a ticket. She studied in the UK and in Texas, completing a PhD then becoming an English teacher. Before her career as a crime writer began, Kate wrote two award-winning collections of poetry.

Kate's favourite hobby is travelling with her husband Dave, an artist and short story writer. She lives in Cambridge, where she enjoys a view from her office of cows roaming across Stourbridge Common, and enjoys regular visits from her three grown-up step-sons.
