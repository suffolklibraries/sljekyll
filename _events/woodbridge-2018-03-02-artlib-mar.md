This is the New Horizons Club’s art group's third exhibition at the library. They are a mix of people with varied talents. Some have been painting for many years, while others have found the delight of painting in their later years. They all enjoy the pleasure and benefits that art brings to their lives and the friendships made within the Club.

The New Horizons Club provides a range of activities and entertainment for older people in the Woodbridge area. The Club meets on Monday and Thursday from 10am - 2.30pm and includes a home cooked lunch at St Mary’s Church House, Market Hill, Woodbridge. The group meets during these periods. If you are interested in joining, contact Brenda on [07514 364752](tel:07514364752).
