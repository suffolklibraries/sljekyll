Join us on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) for a poignant performance from actor Bryan Thurlow as he brings to life Billy Jackson, a pearly king from Bethnal Green recounting his stay as an evacuee on an East Anglian farm during WWII and the dramatic events that befell him and his sister on their brief return to London.

There will also be a raffle and licensed bar available.
