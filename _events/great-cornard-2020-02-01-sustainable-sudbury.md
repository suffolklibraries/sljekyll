[Sustainable Sudbury](https://www.facebook.com/groups/510540616256578/) is a new group aiming to organise talks, share knowledge, develop skills and work with other groups in the area in an effort to grow a resourceful, resilient community in and around Sudbury. Let's gather some ideas and start making plans together at our first meeting.
