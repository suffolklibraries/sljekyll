Hear the true story of notorious Suffolk poacher George Ruffels, aka Joe Whistlecraft, from local historian and writer Pip Wright.

<img src="/images/featured/featured-pip-wright.jpg" alt="Pip Wright" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

Convicted of over 100 crimes and known as 'the man who got away with murder', Joe served more than 20 years in jail in total. Despite this, he and his family are fondly remembered by many who knew them in Rickinghall and Hinderclay. Pip tells Whistlecraft's story as he imagines Whistlecraft would have told it himself in 1959, the year before his death.

After Pip's talk, teams of up to 6 are invited to test their crime knowledge over pizza for the chance to win a prize.

Retired primary school teacher Pip hails from Stowmarket and has spent many years researching local history, writing books and giving talks. He has a particular interest in amusing items from 18th and 19th century newspapers. Including <cite>Whistlecraft</cite>, he has written four historical novels about real people who lived in Suffolk.

Tickets available from the library and Mid Suffolk Tourist Information Centre, Crowe Street, Stowmarket, IP14 1DL.
