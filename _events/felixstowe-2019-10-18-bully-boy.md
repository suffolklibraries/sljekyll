<cite>Bully Boy</cite> is a moving play by broadcaster and presenter Sandi Toksvig about the damage war does to anyone who participates in it, in whatever capacity. Her play tackles the challenging moral issues of contemporary military occupation and its effect on the mental health of serving soldiers with startling insight.

<cite>Bully Boy</cite> focuses on two men: Falklands War veteran Major Oscar Hadley is flown to the front line to probe allegations of severe misconduct by Eddie Clark, a young squaddie from Burnley and part of a self-styled 'Bully Boy' unit of the British Army. As the interrogation develops, Oscar begins to discover that ‘truth’ in a modern insurgency can be a point of view rather than a fact. Both men, we come to realise, are victims of war, and afflicted, in different ways, by combat stress.

This is a one act play that runs for approx 90 minutes.
