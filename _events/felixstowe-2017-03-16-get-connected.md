We're marking the launch of Felixstowe Library's new iPad lending scheme with a special Get Connected event.

You can put your name down on the waiting list to borrow one of our two iPad minis,  supplied by Hughes Electrical. Like our physical books they will be completely FREE (provided you return them before the due date!) and you will get to keep them for up to 3 weeks.

You can also get help and advice on using laptops, tablets or smartphones from tech engineers from Hughes Electrical, community group volunteers and library staff.

Refreshments will also be provided.
