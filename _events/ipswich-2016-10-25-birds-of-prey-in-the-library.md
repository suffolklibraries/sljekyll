This half-term we will be visited by the [Bird of Prey Centre at Stonham Barns](http://www.stonhambarns.co.uk/suffolk-owl-sanctuary/), who will be bringing in some of the birds for you to see and find out about.

Tickets are &pound;3 per child from the ground floor desk. There will be two sessions of 30mins with the birds, followed by crafts if you wish. Grown-up supervision required for under 8s. Crafts will be available from 2pm-4pm, only &pound;1 to do just the crafts.
