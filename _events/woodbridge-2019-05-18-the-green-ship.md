<cite>The Green Ship</cite>, originally written by Quentin Blake, is a heartwarming story about childhood, growing up, the desire for adventure and the power of the imagination.

In this stage adaptation, Alice and George are adults but they become their younger selves as they relate the story. Whilst on a family holiday the two youngsters climb over a neighbourâ€™s wall into a large garden where they discover a huge ship made out of trees and bushes. Throughout the summer they sail the seven seas together visiting exotic places and having thrilling adventures.

Librarian Theatre is a not for profit company who support libraries and communities around the UK by creating accessible, affordable tours of innovative plays specifically tailored to be performed among the bookshelves.
