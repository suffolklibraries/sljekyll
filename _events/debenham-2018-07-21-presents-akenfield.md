<cite>Akenfield</cite> is the interwoven story of three generations of a Suffolk farming family.

Tom lives alone with his widowed mother in the fictional Suffolk village of Akenfield in the 1970s, and plans to get away. His father was killed in the Second World War, but he's heard all sorts of stories about him. His recently-dead grandfather was born and grew up in the village in the 1900s, experienced poverty and hard work and fought in the First World War, and tried to escape the village himself but ended up living in a tied cottage there for the rest of his life.

This unique film features beautiful seasonal scenes, portrayals of colourful customs, and striking music from Michael Tippett, as well as gritty depictions of poverty, entrapment and war.

Tickets available from the library in advance or on the door.
