Budding astronauts and adventurers aged 4-11 are invited to join us for a fun space themed event. Expect out-of-this-world games, activities and crafts.

Dress up as your favourite space character (human or alien) if you like!

A solar snack with a drink can be beamed down for £1 per person.

Children under 8 must be supervised at all times.

Places must be booked in advance by contacting the library – before we run outer space! (*Groan – Ed*)
