Once again, we're letting the teens run the library for the weekend to help raise money for Children in Need! They've promised crafts and activities, a tombola and raffle, scavenger hunt, duck races, Name the Teddy and more.

The Voices Caf√© will be open and there will also be a cooking and bake sale.
