Children are invited to find the beat this half-term and join in our drumming workshop!

No previous skills are needed. Each child will be supplied with an instrument and taught by Mr Bean to develop great sounds and rhythms.

This workshop is for 6-11 year-olds, who must be accompanied by an adult. Tickets must be bought in advance at the library.
