The library is taking part in this year's Stowmarket Christmas Tree Festival. Come in during opening hours to see 14 trees beautifully decorated by local groups and organisations.

You can also see lovely trees at Stowmarket Parish Church, Abbots Hall (in the Museum of East Anglian Life) and in the town centre. See the [Stowmarket Parish Church website](http://www.stowmarketparishchurch.co.uk/Christmas%20Tree%20Festival.php) for more information.
