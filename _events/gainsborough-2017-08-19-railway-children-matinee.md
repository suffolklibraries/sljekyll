Roberta, Phyllis and Peter, three sheltered siblings, suffer a huge upheaval when their father, who works for the Foreign Office, is falsely imprisoned.

The children and their mother, now penniless, are forced to move from London to rural Yorkshire, into a cottage near a railway line, where they befriend the local railway porter, Perks, and embark on a magical journey of discovery, friendship and adventure, the importance of family and the kindness of strangers.

But the mystery remains – where is father, and is he ever coming back?

Refreshments available. Under-8s must be accompanied by an adult.
