Members of the Bury writers' group Write Now! present readings from their work and an informal discussion of the path from pen to publication.  They will talk about about how authors can market and publicise their writing, and the obstacles they have overcome in their publishing journeys.  Members of the group have published in genres spanning memoir, poetry, novels and non-fiction, and published books and ebooks conventionally and independently.  Light refreshments and free copies of their anthology <cite>My Daughter was an Astronaut</cite> will be available.
