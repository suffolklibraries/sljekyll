Join us for a talk and Q&A from author Noël Riley, author of <cite>The Accomplished Lady: a history of genteel pursuits c. 1660-1860</cite>:

> "A study of the skills and pastimes of upper-class women and the works they produced during a 200-year period. These activities included watercolours, printmaking and embroidery, shell work, rolled and cut paper work, sand painting, wax flower modelling, painting on fabrics and china, leather work, japanning, silhouettes, photography and many other activities, some familiar and others little known.

> "The context for these activities sets the scene: the general position of women in society and the constraints on their lives, their virtues and values, marriage, domestic life and education. This background is amplified with chapters on other aspects of women's experience, such as sport, reading, music, dancing and card-playing"

Tea and coffee are available in return for a small donation to the library.
