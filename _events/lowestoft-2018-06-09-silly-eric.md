Children and their parents/carers are invited to meet award-winning author Gracie Wright at the launch of her new book, <cite>Silly Eric Never Gives Up</cite>.

The book is aimed at 2-7 year-olds and follows Eric, who keeps on trying even though, like most of us, he sometimes gets things muddled up and the wrong way round.
