Pauline Manders will be talking about her Utterly crime series. This currently comprises seven books set in and around Suffolk and can be read as standalones.

In the latest book in the series, [<cite>Utterly Dusted</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2334177):

> "Chrissie is under pressure with her carpentry business as Christmas approaches. When told by DI Clive Merry not to meddle in his cases, she struggles to curb her curiosity. Along with old friends Chris and Matt, she is drawn into a whirlpool of stalkers and shadows from the past.

> "A body is found near a golf course and another discovered in a water-logged ditch. Tension racks up against the backdrop of ancient woodland and a search for vintage gifts. The action moves from Bury St Edmunds to Woolpit, Stowmarket to Ipswich, and Onehouse to Framlingham."

Pauline was born in London where she trained as a doctor at University College. After gaining her specialist surgical qualifications, she moved with her husband and young family to East Anglia, where she worked in the NHS as an ENT consultant surgeon for over 25 years.

Since retiring from medicine in 2010 she has pursued her interest in writing crime fiction as well as becoming an active member of a local carpentry group and following her husband's interest in classic cars.

Pauline lives deep in the Suffolk countryside, some of her novels have been designated as 'Suffolk Loves' titles in our libraries, and she has been a sofa guest on BBC Radio Suffolk's Lesley Dolphin Show, with her latest book being given away as a prize.
