Join us for a screening of <cite>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</cite>:

> "American dark comedy drama in which a mother becomes frustrated at the local police force's ineptitude to solve her daughter's murder. When no potential perpetrators have been identified and the investigation slowly grinds to a halt, Mildred (Frances McDormand) takes matters into her own hands to ensure that the media, local citizens and the police take her plight seriously and find her daughter's killer."
