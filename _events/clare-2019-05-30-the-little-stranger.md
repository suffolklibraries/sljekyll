Join us for a screening of <cite>The Little Stranger</cite>:

> "When Dr Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) is called out to tend to a patient dwelling in the vast and decaying Hundreds Hall, a country manor which stood as a landmark of his childhood, he is shocked to find the state of disrepair that the once grand building is now enduring. Called out to treat a former soldier returned from WWII who is suffering from mental deterioration, his behaviour is diagnosed as war shock.

> "As strange events begin to take hold of the Ayres family and their home, however, Dr Faraday must find a rational explanation for the goings-on or risk losing his sanity also."

There will be a licensed bar available.
