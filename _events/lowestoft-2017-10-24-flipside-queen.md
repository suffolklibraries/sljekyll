Under 8s and their parents/carers are invited to join award-winning author Nicholas Allan for illusion, illustration, a reading and a fun workshop in which everyone wins prizes.

This event includes illusions in which tissue paper torn into tiny pieces becomes a pair of elaborate paper pants and another pair is instantly transformed into a giant snowstorm. Each child gets to decorate paper knickers for the Queen.
