Those of a certain age may remember sitting in their cars on Brackenbury Cliffs on Saturday nights, flashing their lights at the pirate radio ships anchored off our coast in the 1960s.

As part of Felixstowe’s larger commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the demise of Radio Caroline and Radio London, a display is being set up in the library. Come along and enjoy some nostalgia of the “swinging sixties” with us.
