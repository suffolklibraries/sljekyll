In the latest in the series, <cite>Utterly Crushed</cite>:

> "As the summer of 2012 draws to a close, the Olympic goodwill sweeping Suffolk can’t last. A brooding menace takes hold of a film production near Stowmarket. Nick, the on-set carpenter is blamed. Chrissie, an old colleague helps out. Matt, a part-time internet people-tracer uncovers networks of deceit. DI Clive Merry discovers that “crush” takes on a whole new meaning for his witnesses. The action moves across the East Anglia from Stowmarket & Diss to Aldeburgh & Orford Ness; Bury St Edmunds to Grundisburgh & Ipswich."
