All members of the Friends of Felixstowe Library are invited to review our first year as a group and look ahead to 2019. We would love to hear your ideas about future events and fundraising opportunities, and your suggestions about how we might spend our funds to improve library facilities.

The meeting will be followed by the **official opening of the Hadwen Room**, our new community space, by Gill Hadwen at 11:15am, and a **performance by the Felixstowe Children's Choir** at 11:30am.
