An amazing event to close the Waveney Kids' Book Festival. Hear Zeb read the two Gaspard the Fox stories accompanied by live music from professional composer/pianist Chris Warner and watch James create live illustrations, then make fox masks, plates and puppets.

Zeb Soanes is known to millions as a newsreader on BBC Radio 4. His first children's book with James Mayhew, [<cite>Gaspard the Fox</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2396720), was inspired by a real life little fox who visits him in London. The fancy-dress dog show in the sequel, [<cite>Gaspard Best in Show</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2604204), takes place in his local square each autumn. The pair will be signing copies and meeting the audience.

James Mayhew is an award-winning author and illustrator who lives in Suffolk. His many titles include the bestselling Katie and Ella Bella books. He has been writing and illustrating for nearly 30 years.

Chris Warner's music features on the Gaspard the Fox audiobooks.
