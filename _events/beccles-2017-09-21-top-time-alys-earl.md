Do you remember the fairy tales of your childhood? Have you been haunted by a snatch of a ballad or a tale told around a camp fire?

From sacred ballads recited in mead halls to shaggy dog tales told over a pint of beer, the story is part of what makes us human. Whether comic, tragic, or terrifying, stories instruct us, amuse us, and help us remember things that have passed.

Local writer Alys Earl will talk about the magic and the history of the folktale and folksong - the way such stories have been used to maintain social norms and to spread discontent. Hear about ‘story sense’, about how tales change as they pass from person to person, are written down, read aloud, memorised and forgotten.

With snatches of history, fiction, tale and song, expect strange lies and even stranger truths.

No need to book. Refreshments available.
