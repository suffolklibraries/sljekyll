Be a CSI agent and solve the crime - who has left evidence & why were they in such a hurry?

You too can dress as an agent and dust for fingerprints and, by looking at our own fingerprints, solve the crime.

£3 per workshop or £5 if you also book the Space station workshop. Parental supervision required for under 8s.

Places limited so please book your tickets early, available from the ground floor enquiry desk.
