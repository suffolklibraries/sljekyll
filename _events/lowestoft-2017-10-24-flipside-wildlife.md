3-6 year-olds and their parents/carers are invited to a 35-minute show by Meg Amsden with all kinds of puppets, storytelling, and songs and original music by Nico Brown of the Dublin Ark.

> "Come with Pip to the wild, glorious, overgrown jungle at the bottom of her garden. Watch the hedgehog feasting on snails, see the barn owl hunting, and if you are lucky, dance with the hare by moonlight.

> "But wait a minute! Whatâ€™s grumpy Gran doing here; clearing brambles, putting up fences, digging the earth, and planting vegetables? Whose garden is it? Pip and Gran are bound to clash. Gran shuts the gate, Pip leaves it open, and something eats the peas. So how will they ever find a way to share the garden, and most of all, how will they all get enough to eat?"
