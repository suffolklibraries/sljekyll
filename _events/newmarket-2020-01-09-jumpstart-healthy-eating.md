Parents and carers are invited to stay on after our regular Tot Rock session for tips and advice on healthy eating from Health Coach Hannah Macrae of [Be Health Happy](http://behealthhappy.co.uk/).

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.
