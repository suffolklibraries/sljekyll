A meeting for anyone who is interested in becoming an active member of our events group named 'FOWL-Eggs'. We meet up approximately once a month for a cup of tea and biscuits to discuss new ways of holding activities or events to help with fundraising for the library.

For more information please either come along, email Kellie Dimmock at kellie.dimmock@suffolklibraries.co.uk or call the library.
