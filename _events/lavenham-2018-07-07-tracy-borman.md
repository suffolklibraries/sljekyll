A true Lavenham favourite, author and historian Tracy Borman has enthralled sell-out audiences at its three literary festivals. Tracy’s much anticipated debut novel, <cite>The King’s Witch</cite>, will be published in June and she will be giving a talk on the novel in the Village Hall as a special fundraising event for The Friends of Lavenham Library.

There will be an opportunity to purchase the book and, after the talk, Tracy will be signing copies and joining the audience members for tea and cake!

Ticket price includes refreshments.

Tickets available online and from the library.

Organised by the Friends of Lavenham Library; all proceeds support the library.
