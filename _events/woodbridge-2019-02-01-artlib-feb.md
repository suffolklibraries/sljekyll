Blaxhall Art Group is an informal group who meet in Blaxhall Village Hall on Thursday mornings to enjoy the companionship of painting and drawing together. Its members work on their own individual projects and at any one time you will find them working in watercolour, oil, acrylic, pastel - whatever has grabbed their interest! Occasionally they invite visiting artists to conduct a workshop or demonstration.

Every year the group has the opportunity to show their work in the Blaxhall Art Exhibition which is held towards the end of June and is open to all local artists, both amateur and professional. This year they have decided also to take advantage of the exhibition space in Woodbridge Library to share their art with library visitors. They hope you enjoy it!
