Best-selling author Jan-Philipp Sendker is visiting Beccles Library to tell us
about his new book ‘Dragon Games'.

Jan-Philipp was the American correspondent, and then the Asian correspondent,
for a German magazine before he spent two years writing his first novel whilst
he lived in a cabin in America. He has since gone on to be successful author. In
2013, he won The indies Choice Honor Award in the category Adult Fiction for
'The Art of Hearing Heartbeats'.

Jan-Philipp's latest two books ‘Whispering Shadows’ and ‘Dragon Games’ are set
in China and Hong Kong and we think they are as magical and compelling as his
other titles 'The Art of Hearing Heartbeats' and the 'Well Tempered Heart'.
He is wildly popular in Book Group circles, and he has won a lot
of attention for his work through word-of-mouth recommendations.

Come and join us at Beccles Library for the chance to meet Jan-Philip!
