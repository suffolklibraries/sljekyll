Paige Langton will be talking about her work with the Dogs' Trust, the UK's largest dog welfare charity. She will also be bringing along her dog Pippa.

Find out about the history and current work of the charity, what they hope to achieve in the future for our four-legged friends, and information about the services and projects they provide to help people from all walks of life with dogs.

Remember - a dog is for life, not just for Christmas!
