There's something for everyone at Elmswell Library Friend's next fundraiser with beer, bubbly, bangers and books on offer for all.

Beer expert Oliver Jackson will guide customers through a selection of beers designed to tantalise your palate. And if beer isn't your tipple, then there will be bubbly flowing as well.

To accompany your drinks at the fundraiser there will be sausages sizzling on the BBQ.

Tickets, available from from the library, are &pound;12.50 per person and all profits will go towards improving the services and facilities at the library.
