Does your toddler or pre-schooler just love to role play? Do they pretend to be a fire fighter, police officer or hairdresser? If so, come and try out our purpose-designed little street where they can be a shopkeeper, run their own café and be a superhero all in one hour!

​A truly fun and interactive play experience for you to share with your little one.

This event is for under 5s who are able to walk. Advance booking by contacting the library is essential.
