ZooLab Animal Detectives will be here to support our Summer Reading Challenge for a fantastical tale of mystery and intrigue!

Our giant land snail super sleuth has a fiendish mystery to solve. All members of the ZooLab animal team, from millipedes to spiders, snakes and frogs to rats and lizards, are on hand to help get to the bottom of the ultimate whodunit! 

ZooLab will be using role play, storytelling and animal handling to fire children’s imagination, confidence and love of the written and spoken word.

Advance booking by contacting the library essential.
