Ahead of [Ally Sherrick's Operation Buried Treasure event](/events/felixstowe-2019-06-29-fbf-operation-buried-treasure/), the Sutton Hoo team will be at the library to tell you more about the site's fascinating history. Handle stunning replicas of some of the treasures found including the helmet, buckle and shoulder clasp, dress up as an Anglo-Saxon, or have a go at creating your own shield.
