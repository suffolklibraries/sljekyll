Join award-winning author Ally Sherrick on a trip through time to discover the places and events that inspired her World War II, Suffolk-set adventure, [<cite>The Buried Crown</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2336157).

Inspired by the discovery of the Anglo-Saxon ship burial and all its priceless treasures near Woodbridge 80 years ago, <cite>The Buried Crown</cite> is the story of young wartime evacuee hero George Penny, Spud the dog, and German-Jewish refugee Kitty Regenbogen's mission to find and protect an ancient treasure.

The session offers lots of participation, including the chance for you to help Ally create the start of a brand new treasure story, and ask questions.

Accompanying adults go free but do require a ticket.

You can also [learn all about Sutton Hoo](/events/felixstowe-2019-06-29-fbf-sutton-hoo/) before this event.
