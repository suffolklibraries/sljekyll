All are welcome to attend the Friends of Lowestoft Library's AGM in the upstairs Meeting Room. Hear about what we've been up to and put yourself forward as a committee member if you like.

If you'd like to know more about becoming a committee member, email **friendsoflowestoftlibrary@gmail.com** with 'for the attention of Bev Cadby' as the subject line.
