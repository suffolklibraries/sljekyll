Ian was born in Northern Ireland in 1966.

On leaving the Service he relocated to Western Australia and established a training and management consultancy.

In 2014, Ian published his first novel and subsequently founded Leschenault Press and The Book Reality Experience, independent, hybrid publishing services that specialise in helping independent writers. He now combines management of these businesses with international speaking engagements and ghost-writing contracts.

His Wright and Tran series of detective novels was launched with the publication of <cite>Face Value</cite> in 2015. The third in the series, <cite>Fall Guys</cite>, won the <cite>Publishers Weekly</cite> BookLife grand prize.
