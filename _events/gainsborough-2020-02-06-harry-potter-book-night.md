Come and celebrate the Triwizard tournament here at Gainsborough Community Library in your best Hogwarts, Beauxbatons or Durmstrang robes. We will be making golden egg bath bombs, Hogwarts house candle/pencil holders and badges supporting our favourite champions, as well as other fun and games.

Under 8s must be accompanied by an adult.
