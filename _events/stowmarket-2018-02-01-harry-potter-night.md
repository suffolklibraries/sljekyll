8+ year-olds are invited to our Harry Potter night.

Between 5pm and 6pm, we will be participating in the Bloomsbury/British Library Living Knowledge Network 'Beasts among the Bookshelves' event. Hear some readings about beasts from the Harry Potter books, followed by some beastly facts, questions and prizes.

From 6pm, there will be all sorts of Harry Potter themed games and activities. Enjoy live magic from a real wizard, Quidditch, wand duelling, seek the snitch and much more!

Dressing up is encouraged - there's a prize for the best costume!

We're also looking for volunteers aged 13+ to help out.
