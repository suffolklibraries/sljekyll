Join us for a screening of <cite>Testament of Youth</cite> at Bungay Community Centre to raise funds for the library and community centre.

> "<cite>Testament of Youth</cite> is a searing story of love, war and remembrance, based on the First World War memoir by Vera Brittain which became the classic testimony of that war from a woman’s point of view. A powerful and passionate journey from youthful hopes and dreams to the edge of despair and back again; a film about young love, the futility of war and how to make sense of the darkest times.

> "Vera Brittain, irrepressible, intelligent and free-minded, overcomes the prejudices of her family and hometown to win a scholarship to Oxford. With everything to live for, she falls in love with her brother’s close friend Roland Leighton as they go to University to pursue their literary dreams.

> "But the First World War is looming and as the boys leave for the front Vera realises she cannot sit idly by as her peers fight for their country, so volunteers as a nurse. She works tirelessly, experiencing all the griefs of war, as one by one her fiancé, her brother and their closest friends are all killed and the pillars of her world shattered.

> "But, an indefatigable spirit, Vera endures and returns to Oxford, irrevocably changed, yet determined to find a new purpose, which spurs her towards a redemptive act of remembrance."
