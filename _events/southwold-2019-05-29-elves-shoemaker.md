> "A hard-working but poor shoemaker gives his final pair of shoes, all he has left in the world, to a poor lady in need of help. The next morning the shoemaker awakes to find that his last piece of leather has been transformed into the most magnificent pair of shoes overnight. He discovers that not only are the shoes beautiful; they are also magical.

> "Who is the mysterious maker of these marvellous shoes?"

This unique children’s classic story is brought to life in colourful, fun, and engaging ballet performances, curated especially with young families and pre-schoolers in mind.

Each story is read for the cinema audience by BBC’s Anita Rani and includes dance move demos by the professional ballet dancers for children to try.  These bite sized ballets provide the perfect way to introduce young children to the artistic beauty of ballet in a comfortable, affordable, local family friendly setting while encouraging a fun trip to the cinema and an engaging interactive experience.

These ballets were originally shown on CBeebies, generating the most views for any CBeebies content during the three months they were shown. Now remastered and designed especially for cinema, we are delighted to be bringing these classic stories to the big screen.
