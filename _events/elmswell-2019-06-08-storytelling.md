Come and listen to tales from East Anglian storytellers. Whether we are young or old, stories take us out of ourselves into another world, where anything is possible, and anything might happen!

This event is part of the lead-up to the [East Anglian Storytelling Festival](http://eastanglianstorytellingfestival.co.uk/), which takes place in Elmswell from 14 - 16 June 2019.
