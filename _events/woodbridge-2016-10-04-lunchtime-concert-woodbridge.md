Woodbridge School student William Emery will be playing the viola for us.

After achieving a series of local awards, including the Suffolk Festival Senior String Champion Music Committee Cup and Woodbridge School’s prestigious Louise Livett Trophy, William’s talent was recognized nationally and he has secured a place in the National Youth Orchestra.

Free entry but any donations for the Friends of Woodbridge Library gratefully received.
