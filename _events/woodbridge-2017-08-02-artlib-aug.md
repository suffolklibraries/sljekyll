Beth has stitched and made clothing from early childhood, so it was inevitable that her textile art should develop into creating wearable items. Found fabrics suggest to Beth directions of creative travel and recent finds of vintage cloth and buttons have inspired her textile art. Closer observation and recording of natural forms also inform her work. Her pieces contain many organic references which are expressed through felting, dyeing, stitching and embroidery.

Beth holds a City and Guilds Diploma in Creative Textiles and Embroidery. She is also a member of the Embroiderersâ€™ Guild and O2 Textile Group.
