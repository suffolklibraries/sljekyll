Young book-lovers are invited to the second meeting of Woodbridge's Young Adult book club: a new group run by young people, for young people.

As well as the hottest new releases and our favourite authors, we will be talking about Jennifer Mathieu's empowering novel [<cite>Moxie</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2198449). You can get a taster from [group leader Emily's review](/new-suggestions/young-adult/moxie-by-jennifer-mathieu/).

You don't have to have read the whole book - just come along and join the discussion. Refreshments will be provided!
