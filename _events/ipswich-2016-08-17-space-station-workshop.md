British Tim Peake has been in space and now you too can travel to space and back!

Come and see the food they eat in space, see how difficult it is to repair a space craft and also understand what astronauts wear.

£3 per workshop or £5 if you also book the Forensic science workshop. Parental supervision required for under 8s.

Places limited so please book your tickets early, available from the ground floor enquiry desk.
