Multi-sensory experience with 2015 Suffolk Skald of the year, Marion Leeper, for 2-5 year-olds and their carers. Find out who stole the darkness, why the sun and moon are high and dry in the sky and how three monkeys came to be in a canoe.

Just 15 can fit inside the magic tent for each performance, to please book in advance to guarantee a place in one of the smallest theatres in the world!
