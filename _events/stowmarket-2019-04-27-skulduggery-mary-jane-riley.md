Mary-Jane Riley will be discussing how her interviews with Ruth Rendell and PD James as a journalist encouraged her to begin writing crime fiction.

Mary-Jane spent many years as a BBC journalist, presenting magazine programmes on both BBC Radio Suffolk and BBC Radio Norfolk, and has covered some of the major crime stories of the past twenty years.

Mary-Jane is married to a television reporter and they have three grown-up children and two golden retrievers. She lives in rural Suffolk and the landscape of her home county plays an important part in her writing.
