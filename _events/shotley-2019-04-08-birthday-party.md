Help us celebrate the second birthday of our weekly library at Shotley Village Hall! We're also celebrating the fact that there have been over 3,500 visits to the library since it opened, with over 5,000 books borrowed.

Our wonderful volunteers Gloria and Rosie are holding a teddy bears' picnic with sandwiches, sweet treats and refreshments.  All welcome - don't forget to bring your teddy bear!

We will be running [our usual activities](/libraries/shotley/) and you can borrow books as normal.
