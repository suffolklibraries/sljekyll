Edward FitzGerald is one of Woodbridge’s most historically famous residents. He was born in Bredfield in 1809, studied at Trinity College, Cambridge and inherited a fortune large enough to enable him to live a quiet life “preoccupied with flowers, music and literature”.

In the 1850s he was introduced to an old Persian poem which he translated and published as <cite>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</cite>. Slowly the poem became famous and it is now the one literary work for which FitzGerald is known across the world. His blue plaque is on a house in Pytches Road and there is a stone high up on a building on Market Hill bearing his initials.

Charles Muggleston will introduce the poem and then read it in the library’s meeting room.
