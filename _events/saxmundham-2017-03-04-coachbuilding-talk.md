This illustrated talk looks at the design of horse-drawn carriages in their heyday, just before the motor car took their place.

It focuses on examples from an Ipswich coachbuilder's catalogue, looking at some of the designs and how the industry operated.

It was a craft-industry which happily accommodated the client's individual preferences.
