Computer games critic Cara Ellison spent a year living with and writing about games developers around the world. She will be discussing the experience with Krystal Vittles from Suffolk Libraries' innovation team.

In January 2014 Cara Ellison was highly regarded for her cultural criticism in the national press, but was still only making ends meet financially. When she came up with the idea to travel the world to meet game creators in a gonzo journalism project, she went to her Twitter followers to help fund it. She needed $1000 for her first flight. She never thought she’d achieve it&hellip;

Within an hour of posting her pledge on Patreon, Cara - dubbed a ‘cyberpunk hair-dyed Attenborough’ - had left home and embarked on a year travelling four continents, living on game makers’ couches, writing about their cities and creations.

Six hundred readers funded her round-the-world trip, from London to Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne.

Writing all the way, Cara’s blog of her observations and experiences was collected into a book called <cite>Embed with Games</cite>, a map of independent game creations as she found it.
