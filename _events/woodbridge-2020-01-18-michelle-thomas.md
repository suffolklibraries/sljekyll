Join us for an evening with the brilliant Michelle Thomas, author of <cite>My Sh*t Therapist & other mental health stories</cite>.

<cite>My Sh*t Therapist</cite> is an honest account of living with mental illness, which mimics the frank, honest and - dare we say? - funny interactions Michelle has had with her friends and followers about madness, medication, and making the most of a misbehaving brain.

Ticket price includes refreshments.

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.
