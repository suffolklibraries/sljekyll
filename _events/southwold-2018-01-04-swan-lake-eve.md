When it premiered at Sadler's Wells, Matthew Bourne's triumphant modern re-interpretation of <cite>Swan Lake</cite> turned tradition upside down, taking the dance world by storm.

Bourne blends dance, humour and spectacle with extravagant, award winning designs by Lez Brotherston, to create a provocative and powerful <cite>Swan Lake</cite> for our times.

Enjoy a witty and beautifully disturbing version of the prince's dark spiral into derangement, danced by a menacing and animalistic male ballet corps.
