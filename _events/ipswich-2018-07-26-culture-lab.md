Join us for a special event to officially launch our new Arts Council England funded arts programme and showcase the results of our ‘Culture Lab’ artists' residency held at the library during the week.

Meet the artists in residence and see the programme's new name and branding, which has been created with the help of a group of young people in partnership with Suffolk-based artists Off the Press Collective.

This is also an opportunity for us to say a big thank you to everyone for their support, ideas and enthusiasm for the new arts programme. Anyone who is interested in finding out more about the arts programme is welcome to come along.

Refreshments will be provided.

Space is limited, so please email Melissa Matthews at **arts@suffolklibraries.co.uk** if you would like to attend.
