The Suffolk Libraries Youth Council is looking for opinionated, passionate young people aged 11â€“25 to influence the creative direction of the Suffolk Libraries arts programme, [BLOC](/bloc/).

This taster day will be a chance to have your voice heard, contribute ideas and test out some of our new creative projects.

Refreshments will be provided, but make sure to **bring a packed lunch**.

[Book your place online](https://artslibraries.typeform.com/to/i628Sy), text **07752 380859** or email **arts@suffolklibraries.co.uk**

We look forward to seeing you there.
