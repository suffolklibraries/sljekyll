In Malaya in 1948, the Malayan National Liberation Army took to the jungle, killing plantation managers, ambushing rubber plantations, and attacking trains and buses, starting a 12-year war. The Malayan government called it an "emergency" because if they called it a war, the insurance companies would not pay out. 

Britain intervened in the early 1950s by using helicopters to destroy food crops with herbicides and defoliants. Find out more with this informative talk.
