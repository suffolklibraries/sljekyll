We're afraid this event has now **sold out**. However, you can still see Elly at [Southwold Library on Saturday 10 February](/events/southwold-2018-02-10-elly-griffiths/) and [Woodbridge Library on Saturday 17 February](/events/woodbridge-2018-02-17-elly-griffiths/).

Hear Dagger in the Library award-winner Elly Griffiths talk about her new book, [<cite>The Dark Angel</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317358).

Copies will be on sale and Elly will be signing them.
