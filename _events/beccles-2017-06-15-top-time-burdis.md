Hear the story of the magnificent work of the Women's Land Army in World Wars I and II.

Due to the run-down state of the farming industry, young men going to war and the threat of U-boats sinking the food supply, some 83,000 women aged 17-40 were recruited into farming work. Their efforts reduced our high dependency on food imports and saved us from bread rationing.

No need to book. Refreshments available.
