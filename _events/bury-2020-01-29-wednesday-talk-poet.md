<cite>Exposure: Snapshots from the Life of Lee Miller</cite>, by local poet Derek Adams reveals the extraordinary life and inner conflict of American photographer Lee Miller. The poems do not form a comprehensive biography, but rather an album of snapshots taken from events in Lee Miller’s life, her photographs and well-known artworks she inspired.

A professional photographer himself, Derek has spent several years meticulously researching the life story of Lee Miller. He will talk about Miller's life, loves and career, interspersed with poems from his book.

> 'Derek Adams’ poetry gives us both the nuance and the power of Lee Miller’s personality. His insightful lines connect her talent as a surrealist artist and her achievements as war correspondent to the vulnerable person within who secretly bore the scars of child abuse and wartime traumas. I regard this book as a perceptive and touching portrait of my mother.’ 

\- Antony Penrose, son of Lee Miller.
