Local author David Laws will be at the library talking about his suspence  [<cite>Munich: The Man Who Said No!</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2331988):

> "Munich 1938.

> "Two men successfully gatecrash the closed conference at Munich as British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain is about to sign an agreement giving Adolf Hitler everything he wants in Czechoslovakia."

> "Britain 2015.

> "Emma Drake, a history researcher at Cambridge, has never believed her grandfather simply disappeared without a trace. The infamous Munich agreement was signed; Chamberlain returned home a short-lived hero; Hitler emerged all-powerful to wage his war and her grandfather vanished from the pages of history. The Munich police reportedly searched for him but found nothing.

> "For the family of Bradley C Wilkes, this appeared to be the end of the story. But on the 70th anniversary of Wilkes’s radio station, Emma is chosen to lead a conference to reassess the significance of the events in Munich.

> "Hungry for success, Emma can now reopen the mystery of her missing grandfather – but there are obstacles in her way: rebuffed by powerful relatives, beset by an arms dealing conspiracy and hit by an Intelligence “sting”, she’s almost won... until her trail takes her in an unexpected direction, to a forest 50 miles west of Auschwitz to trace partisan action against Hitler’s Final Solution."
