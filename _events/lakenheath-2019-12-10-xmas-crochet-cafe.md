Come along and have a go at making some Christmas bunting with the Friends of Lakenheath Library (F. O. L. K.)!

For £5 you'll get a kit including everything you need, as well as full instructions and tuition. No previous experience needed.

There will also be tea/coffee and homemade cake available for a small extra cost.

Advance booking by contacting the library is essential.

All proceeds will go to the library.
