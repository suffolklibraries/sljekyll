As part of the British Library Living Knowledge Network, Suffolk Libraries is displaying selection of images and information from the [Harry Potter: A History of Magic](https://www.bl.uk/projects/harry-potter-a-history-of-magic-public-library-displays) exhibition.

The display celebrates and explores the historical, folkloric and mythological origins of magic that J. K. Rowling draws on in the creation of her wizarding world. It also celebrates the 20-year legacy of the publishing phenomenon of Harry Potter and will be accompanied by a new Suffolk Libraries book collection.

For more information, see our [news article about the History of Magic display](/news/history-of-magic/).

You can also see the display at [Ipswich Library from 20 October-4 December](/events/ipswich-2017-10-20-history-of-magic/) and [Haverhill Library from 8-31 December](/events/haverhill-2017-12-08-history-of-magic/).
