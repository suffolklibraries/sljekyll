Once an exciting and essential part of American entertainment, the river boats of the Mississippi are now a fleeting memory of times past. <cite>Show Boat</cite> gives us a vivid glimpse into the world of these floating theatres, showing the myriad stories and lives that surrounded and depended on each one. Beginning in 1887, we see three generations performers and workers as they navigate the epic tale of enduring love and racial tolerance.

Tickets available from the library and Southwold Arts Centre.
