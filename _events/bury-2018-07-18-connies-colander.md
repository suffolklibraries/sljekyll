> "Connie is a retired domestic science teacher. Emily, her daughter, is enjoying hosting her first TV cookery show: <cite>Connie’s Colander</cite>, bringing her mother’s recipes onscreen and up to date.

> "Sensitively, with humour and tenderness, this newly written play traces the evolving relationship throughout their lives, and the impact of Connie’s Alzheimer’s. Can their relationship, and the TV show, survive?"

Running time 50 mins, followed by an informal 20 minute post-show Q&A with local dementia specialists who can provide signposting.

Building on the story within the play, the audience is also encouraged to share their own experiences, both to ‘offload’ and also to help support fellow audience members, if appropriate.

> “This is a compelling play, excellently acted and tautly directed...”

/- <cite>The Oxford Times</cite>

> “… beautifully crafted, tightly written, intensely poignant and moving exploration of the effect of dementia on a mother and her daughter…a short dramatic jewel.”

/- <cite>Daily Info</cite>
