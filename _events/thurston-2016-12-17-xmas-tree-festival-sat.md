See trees decorated by village families, schools, businesses and organisations at the library and St Peter's Church. If you'd like to display a tree, contact Irene Churchus on [01359 230652](01359230652) or Richard Fawcett on [01359 231363](01359231363).

As well as Christmas activities for children, there will be a biscuit bake-off at the library. Details are as follows:

* We are focusing on the decoration of your biscuits and we encourage you to use home baked biscuits. NO GINGERBREAD HOUSE KITS PLEASE!
* There are 2 categories:
  * 6 Christmas decorated biscuits. These can be identical or different.
  * A 3D gingerbread Christmas structure, for example, a stable, star, tree or church.
* There are 3 age groups:
  * Group 1: aged 5-11
  * Group 2: aged 12-16
  * Group 3: aged over 16
* You can enter one or both categories and prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd in each age group.
* Please bake and decorate your entries at home and bring them along to the Library on a paper plate or a board between 10.15am and 10.45am on Saturday 17 December.
* The entries will be available for the public to view between 1100 and 1200.
* Judging will take place at 1200 and prizes awarded at 1230.
* If you choose to donate your biscuits and gingerbread structures they will be taken to the church for refreshments.
* If you prefer to take your bakes home they will be ready to collect between 1300 and 1330.

Visit the church for refreshments and children's activities. Trees will remain on display at both venues until 1200 on 8 January, when the church has its Epiphany service.
