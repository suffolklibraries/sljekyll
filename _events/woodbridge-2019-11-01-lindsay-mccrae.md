Award-winning wildlife cameraman Lindsay McCrae has is the author of <cite>My Penguin Year</cite>, an extraordinary account of the time he spent alongside emperor penguins on Antarctica, filming for the BBC's <cite>Dynasties</cite> series. Lindsay spent a year 15,000km from home, where winter lasted eight months and no-one could get in or out of their station on the ice.
