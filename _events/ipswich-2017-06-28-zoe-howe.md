Zoë Howe is a music writer, musician and artist whose renowned rock biographies include <cite>Typical Girls? The Story of The Slits</cite>, <cite>Barbed Wire Kisses - The Jesus and Mary Chain Story</cite>, <cite>Stevie Nicks – Visions, Dreams & Rumours</cite>, Lee <cite>Brilleaux – Rock ‘n’ Roll Gentleman</cite> and <cite>Wilko Johnson - Looking Back At Me</cite>.
