This talk is for anyone who is interested in uncovering a totally new way of understanding our mental and emotional wellbeing and how we already have everything within us for peace of mind, ease, grace etc. Worry, anxiety and depression feel very real and we have a very real experience of them, but they are made in and of thought - and as thought changes so can our experiences of these more difficult feelings.

Come along and join us to find out more about the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought, a simple insight-based understanding which has no techniques and thereâ€™s nothing to do, except listen and effortlessly reconnect with your innate wellbeing.

No need to book - pay on the door. For more information, visit [Mia Philips' website](http://miaphilips.com/).
