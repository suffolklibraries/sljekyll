11-25 year-olds are invited to a special art session! Working with artist Kristy Campbell, you will be designing two murals for Lowestoft Library. We want a mash up of all of your ideas, memories and favourite places in Lowestoft to create a personal patchwork of the town.

This event is free, though [online booking](https://artslibraries.typeform.com/to/K53LMa) is required. All equipment and refreshments will be provided. We look forward to seeing you!

This event is part of our [BLOC Youth Arts programme](/bloc/)
