Author Callista Bowright will be at the library talking about her book <cite>The Sixth of September</cite>:

> "As Olivia grows up within a simple Lancashire background, her traumatic childhood experiences propel her on a painful path that eventually moulds her into a tough, beautiful fighter.

> "Sophie could not be more different. Although she is raised in wealth and comfort, she lacks confidence and struggles, in her hippy way, through similar life experiences and losses with nervous bravery.

> "Both are sensual, raunchy, strong, and loving women who defy society's hypocrisy. Then one September day, their worlds collide. Olivia and Sophie could be bitter rivals, but they are intelligent women who combine their strengths to face and cope with the past and present."

Ticket price includes refreshments.
