Everyone is welcome to celebrate [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) and the end of the [Three Library Challenge](/news/three-library-challenge/) with cake at the library.

We'd really appreciate it if you could donate a cake! Please bring it in to the library on Friday 11 or Saturday 12 October.
