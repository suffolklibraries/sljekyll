Set against the backdrop of post-war Britain, John Osborne's modern classic conjures the seedy glamour of the old music halls for an explosive examination of public masks and private torment.

Branagh's first season concludes with a production that has at its centre the memorably sad, middle-aged figure of fading music-hall star Archie Rice, whose failing career is set against the backdrop of post-Colonial decline and personal tragedy. This role was famously played by Laurence Olivier in the original 1957 production and as Branagh is frequently compared to Olivier, anticipation will be at fever pitch when he takes on this iconic role.
