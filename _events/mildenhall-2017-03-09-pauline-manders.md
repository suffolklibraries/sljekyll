Talk and book signing with Suffolk author Pauline Manders, who has written 6 crime novels set in Suffolk: <cite>Utterly Explosive</cite>, <cite>Utterly Fuelled</cite>, <cite>Utterly Rafted</cite>, <cite>Utterly Reclaimed</cite>, <cite>Utterly Knotted</cite> and <cite>Utterly Crushed</cite>.

In the latest in the series, <cite>Utterly Crushed</cite>:

> "As the summer of 2012 draws to a close, the Olympic goodwill sweeping Suffolk can’t last. A brooding menace takes hold of a film production near Stowmarket. Nick, the on-set carpenter is blamed. Chrissie, an old colleague helps out. Matt, a part-time internet people-tracer uncovers networks of deceit. DI Clive Merry discovers that “crush” takes on a whole new meaning for his witnesses. The action moves across the East Anglia from Stowmarket & Diss to Aldeburgh & Orford Ness; Bury St Edmunds to Grundisburgh & Ipswich."

Pauline's books will be for sale at a reduced price.

Free entry, coffee or tea available for £1.
