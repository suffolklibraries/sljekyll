Clarinetist Dan Kirkpatrick will be playing a selection of classical, jazz and klezmer music.  He has hinted that he may also play some piano for us.

Kirkpatrick, who recently graduated from the University of Essex, has performed as part of a jazz ensemble, woodwind orchestra and as a solo artist.  As an independent artist, he continues to arrange, compose and perform across genres.

Free entry but any donations for the Friends of Woodbridge Library gratefully received.
