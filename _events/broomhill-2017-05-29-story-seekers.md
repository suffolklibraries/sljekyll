Part of Ipswich County Library's Multicultural Day.

The Story Seekers Griot Chinyere and Abass Dodoo bring their wares and treasures to the library for your delight and discoveries. Hear their own stories and experience Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage and ancestral storytelling, percussion and drumming.

Griot Chinyere is from a long line of storytellers and is continuing her family traditions and skills. She is a leading storyteller and the founder of Nne Agwu Afrakan: The First Afrakan Storytelling Festival in Britain.

Abass Dodoo comes from The Family of Royal Master Ghanaian Drummers and he is an internationally touring drummer who founded and is director of One Drum, the most famous West African drumming troupe in Britain.

Please join us for a fun-filled and exciting show. No tickets, no charge, everybody welcome.

Arts La'Olam is an Ipswich-based organisation specialising in intercultural arts events, which has been granted generous awards from Arts Council England, Ipswich Borough Council, Essex County Council and Suffolk County Council to invite these leading storytellers to the UK.
