The Story Seekers Griot Chinyere and Abass Dodoo bring their wares and treasures for your delight and discoveries, on top of Broomhill if the weather is fine, and in the library if it's not.

We will have teas and coffees in the library afterwards too.

Please join us for a fun-filled and exciting show. No tickets, no charge, everybody welcome.
