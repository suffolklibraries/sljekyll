Charlie Haylock kicks off this year's Skulduggery in Stowmarket with an entertaining and informative talk on English dialects.

<img src="/images/featured/featured-charlie-haylock.jpg" alt="Charlie Haylock" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

This is not a talk on split infinitives, and what the differences are between the past participle and the past tense. Definitely not! Charlie shows how the seeds of spoken English was first sown, and how each invading force affected the English language with the different sounds they brought. He includes a dialect tour of the British Isles, demonstrating the different facial expressions of each dialect, and shows how lip readers can tell what dialect a person has.

Charlie is a historian on spoken English and English surnames, a dialect specialist, a Suffolk bestselling author, regular spot on BBC Radio Suffolk, and the creator of the weekly cartoons in the <cite>East Anglian Daily Times</cite>.

Ticket price includes a cheese and wine supper.
