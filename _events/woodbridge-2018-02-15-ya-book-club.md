Young book-lovers are invited to the first meeting of Woodbridge's Young Adult book club: a new group run by young people, for young people. As well as the hottest new releases and our favourite authors, we will be talking about Samira Ahmed's new book [<cite>Love, Hate & Other Filters</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2305526):

> "Maya Aziz dreams of being a film maker in New York. Her family have other ideas. They want her to be a dutiful daughter who wears gold jewellery and high heels and trains to be a doctor. But jewellery and heels are so uncomfortable. She's also caught between the guy she should like and the guy she does like. But she doesn't want to let Kareem down and things with Phil would never work out anyway. Would they?

> "Then a suicide bomber who shares her last name strikes in a city hundreds of miles away and everything changes."

You don't have to have read the whole book - just come along and join the discussion. Refreshments will be provided!
