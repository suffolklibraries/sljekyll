Come and experience this powerful vehicle of awakening and self-mastery. More than a moving meditation, more than a healing therapy, it dissolves patterns of stress, trauma and contraction held in the body/mind/energy field to reveal your authentic nature.

Venetia will demonstrate/dance the full sequence of The Form with someone sitting in a chair as receiver, and then participants will share a short movement called "Cosmo-Form" together and in pairs. They will then share their inner discoveries.

All profits to Venetia's Helping Hands Network volunteering trip to Bosnia in the spring.
