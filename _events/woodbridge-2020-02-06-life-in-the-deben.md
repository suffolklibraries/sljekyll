Join <cite>Life on the Deben</cite> creators Tim Curtis and Nick Cottam for a special screening of previously unseen scenes shot for the film. <cite>Life on Deben</cite>, followed last autumn by a book of the same title, has rapidly become a local favourite. Inevitably, though, some scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor.

Tim will introduce the previously unseen footage and he and Nick will talk about the creation of the extremely attractively produced book that now complements the DVD. There will be plenty of time for your questions and the book will be on sale.

Contact the library to book your ticket.
