Mary-Jane Riley will be talking about her Alex Devlin series, set in Suffolk and Norfolk.

Mary-Jane spent many years as a BBC journalist before becoming a crime fiction writer, inspired by her talks with Ruth Rendell and PD James as well as the hundreds of interviews she conducted during her journalism career. She is married to a television reporter and they have three grown-up children and two golden retrievers. She lives in rural Suffolk and the landscape of her home county plays an important role in her writing.

The first Alex Devlin novel is [<cite>The Bad Things</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1857684), set in Southwold. The latest, [<cite>Dark Waters</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2363721), is a story of family secrets and jealousies from the past, set on the atmospheric Norfolk Broads.

There will be an opportunity to buy Mary-Jane's books from Beccles Books and have them signed after the talk.
