Enjoy some superbly silly stories about Uncle Shawn, Badger Bill, four bickering llamas and more, then make your own badger.

A. L. Kennedy was born in a small Scottish town far too long ago and has written books for adults and children, but mainly adults. Before that she made up stories to amuse herself. It has always surprised her that her job involves going one of the things she loves most and she's very grateful to be a writer. She has won awards for her books in several countries. She plays the banjo badly, but makes up for this by never playing it anywhere near anyone else.
