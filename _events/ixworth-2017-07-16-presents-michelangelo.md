A full and fresh biography of Michelangelo who, along with Leonardo, is considered one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, and perhaps of all time, coinciding with the glorious exhibition at London's National Gallery.

The film explores his relationship with his contemporaries and his immense artistic practice which included painting, sculpture and architecture - not least the universally adored David in Florence, and the Sistine Chapel in Rome.

Go to the heart of just who this tempestuous, passionate but much-loved genius was.

Runtime 90 minutes, bring your own drinks and snacks.
