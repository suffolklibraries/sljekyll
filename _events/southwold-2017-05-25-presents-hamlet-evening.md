Shakespeare's most iconic work, <cite>Hamlet</cite> explodes with big ideas and is the ultimate story of loyalty, love, betrayal, murder and madness.

From its sell-out run at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre comes a film version of this unique and critically acclaimed production of <cite>Hamlet</cite> with BAFTA-nominee Maxine Peake in the title role. This groundbreaking stage production, directed by Sarah Frankcom, was the Royal Exchange's fastest-selling show in a decade.

Alongside Maxine Peake as the eponymous prince, a number of other roles, including Polonious and Rosencrantz, are also played by women. <cite>Hamlet</cite> is brought to cinemas by film director Margaret Williams, whose <cite>Written on Skin</cite> (Royal Opera House/BBC) won many awards including the Diapason d'Or. The film is produced by Anne Beresford and Debbie Gray, the team behind the highly successful cinema broadcast of <cite>Peter Grimes</cite> on Aldeburgh beach, which Margaret also directed.

Tickets are available from Southwold Library and Southwold Arts Centre.
