Jill Dawson will be talking about her new novel, <cite>The Language of Birds</cite>, a hypnotic novel about class, violence and friendship inspired by the shocking Lord Lucan case and the 'lovely young nanny' at its centre.

Jill herself worked as a nanny in London in the 1980s, and now lives in the Cambridgeshire Fens. She is the founder of Gold Dust, a mentoring scheme for new writers, and patron of the Maya Centre, which offers therapy to women experience violence or sexual violence. Her other novels include [<cite>The Crime Writer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098880), which won the East Anglian Book of the Year and was shortlisted for the 2017 New Angle Prize, and [<cite>Lucky Bunny</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=325928) won a Fiction Uncovered Award.
