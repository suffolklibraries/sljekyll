Suffolk residents may be familiar with The Boy's Grave on the road between Newmarket and Kentford. Across England there are other unusual graves where people were buried in unusual locations, often by the public highway, at a spot that has been clearly marked so that passers-by can recognise the location and be reminded of the person laid to rest there.

Local historian Robert Halliday has long been fascinated by such landmarks, and has spent much time investigating the traditions about the Boy's Grave and similar sites. In this illustrated talk he will relate some of the tales told about these peculiar places.
