Paul Evans (AMOT Curator at the Suffolk Regiment Museum, Bury St Edmunds) will be discussing military records, family research, the Suffolk Regiment and the wider MOD framework.

Paul has spent his career working in military history libraries and archives, and has appeared on several television programmes. He was also the artillery advisor to Guy Ritchie for the film <cite>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</cite>.

Paul's first talk back in January was fully booked; this talk will encompass much of what was discussed then, but with a greater emphasis on his career as a military archivist.
