Enrol now for a one-night semester of slapstick with the professor of pratfalls, Harold Lloyd, in his varsity-themed romp (and biggest box-office hit) <cite>The Freshman</cite>!

The new student on campus, Harold, dreams of being the most popular man in college but instead becomes the butt of the joke when he attempts to join the football team. <cite>The Freshman</cite> showcases Lloyd's faculty for physical comedy as well as his trademark charm, cementing his place alongside Keaton and Chaplin as a PhD of silent comedy.

The Lucky Dog Picturehouse recreates the early cinema experience for modern audiences. They specialise in screening classic silent films with original, era-specific live musical soundtracks composed and performed by some of the UK’s finest young musicians.
