'Mr Tim', jazz saxophonist 'Timbo' Sadler will be playing for us again today in our series of popular lunchtime concerts. Tim has been playing the saxophone for 47 years and can often be seen busking in the local area.  

Free entry but any donations for the Friends of Woodbridge Library gratefully received.
