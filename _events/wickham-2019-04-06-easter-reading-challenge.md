Under-12s are invited to take part in our annual Easter reading challenge!

Pop into the library any time during the Easter holidays to pick up a reading record card. Read four books, ask a member of staff or volunteer to mark your card when you return them, then post your card in the prize draw box for the chance to win a super-size Easter egg!

The draw will take place in the library at 4pm on Tuesday 23 April.
