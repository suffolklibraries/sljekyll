What is it like to work in a library? Have you always wanted to go wild with a date stamp?
As part of our [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) fundraising, we're offering you the opportunity to live out that 'librarian' fantasy whilst raising money through sponsorship.

Places are limited so for more information and to sign up, see staff at the foyer desk.
