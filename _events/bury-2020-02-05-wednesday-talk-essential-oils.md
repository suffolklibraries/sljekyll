Louise will tell us what CPTG Essential Oils are and what makes them so special, including how they are grown, processed, and tested. You'll have the opportunity to smell a few essential oils and experience their effects, find out how they can be used and how best to do so, and learn how particular essential oils can assist with mental, physical and emotional health and help in times of illness.

Advance booking by contacting the library is advised.
