Have you given birth in the last 5 years?

This is a chance to give your feedback about your experiences of maternity services in Great Yarmouth and Waveney in an informal environment. Abby, women's experience midwife at the James Paget, and the Birth Voices East team, will be on hand to guide the discussion and talk with you.

For more information, post on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/590636111414399/) or email **birthvoiceseast@yahoo.co.uk**
