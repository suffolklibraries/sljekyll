Dame Stella Rimington will be talking about her Liz Carlyle spy series.

<img src="/images/featured/featured-stella-rimington.jpg" alt="Stella Rimington" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

Stella joined the Security Service (MI5) in 1968. During her career she worked in all the main fields of the Service: counter-subversion, counter-espionage and counter-terrorism. She was appointed director general in 1992, the first woman to hold the post.

Her latest book is [<cite>Breaking Cover</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2161430), the ninth Liz Carlyle book.

There will be an opportunity to buy Stella's books from Beccles Books and have them signed after the talk.
