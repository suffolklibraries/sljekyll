Hear author Gavin Milnthorpe talk about his latest novel, [<cite>Second Hand Scott</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2331637):

> "Scott Logan, AKA Second Hand Scott, specialises in picking up girls who have just been dumped, jilted or otherwise broken-hearted. But he isn't your stereotypical romantic cad and bounder. No; he actually thinks he's being helpful. But one day, Scott is forced to choose between his continued second hand existence and the possibility of true love."

You can also buy his books on the day and get them signed.
