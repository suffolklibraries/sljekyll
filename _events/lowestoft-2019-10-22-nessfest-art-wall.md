[NessFest](https://www.facebook.com/NessFestLowestoft/) is back for a second year!

11-19 year-olds are invited to drop in and make their mark on our Live Art Wall as part of [The Big Draw](https://thebigdraw.org/), in association with [Creative Collisions](https://creativecollisions.org.uk/). Express your story and help create a large, bold, collaborative art piece and watch it transform over the course of the day.
