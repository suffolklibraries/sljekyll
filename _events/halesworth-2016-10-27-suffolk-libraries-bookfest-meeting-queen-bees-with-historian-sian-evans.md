**In the aftermath of the First World War, the previously strict hierarchies of the British class system were weakened. For a number of ambitious, spirited women, this was the chance they needed to take their place at the top of society as the great hostesses of the time. Cultural historian, Sian Evans tells us more.**

Introducing this witty, entertaining and fascinating account of a social revolution, Sian will be giving an illustrated talk about her book <cite>Queen Bees</cite>, published this autumn.

Sian is a cultural historian who has worked for the National Trust, the V&A and the Design Museum. She will be explaining how, in an age when the place of women was uncertain, becoming a hostess was not a chore but a career choice, and though some of the hostesses' backgrounds were surprisingly humble, their aspirations were anything but. During the inter-war years, these extraordinary women ruled over London society from their dining tables and salons - entertaining everyone from the Mosleys to the Mitfords, from millionaires to maharajahs, from film stars to royalty.

Sian has chosen to introduce us to six of these formidable women - Lady Nancy Astor, the first female MP to take her seat, who rode pillion on Lawrence of Arabia's motorbike; Lady Sybil Colefax, an interior designer and loyal friend to Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson; Laura Corrigan, who sold jewellery to Hermann Goering to fund the French Resistance; Lady Emerald Cunard, the scapegoat for the Abdication, who transformed the Arts scene; Mrs Ronnie Greville, who holed up on the top floor of a London hotel as the Luftewaffe dropped bombs around her; and Lady Edith Londonderry, the founder of the Women's Legion, who wore a snake tattoo on her ankle.

The influence of these extraordinary women can still be felt today. Come and find out more, and meet the author Sian Evans in this special evening event at the library. Book signing begins from 8.30pm.
