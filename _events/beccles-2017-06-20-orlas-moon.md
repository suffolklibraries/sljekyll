Theatre company [Wonderful Beast](http://www.wonderfulbeast.co.uk/) present <cite>Orla's Moon</cite>, a new immersive musical theatre production for 0-3 year-olds and their carers:

> "Step into a beautiful moonlit world of dappled light, shimmering stars and tinkling bells and join us on Orla’s night adventure with her faithful dog, Silver, leading the way. Our welcoming cast will tell an enchanting story through song, dance and sensory props, inviting children to interact and immerse themselves in the joy of play."

The performance will be followed by [moon making and stories for 0-3 year-olds](/events/beccles-2017-06-20-moon-crafts/).

Please only book for the babies & toddlers. Parents, grandparents and carers DO NOT require a ticket.

This is a ‘pay what you can’ show, contributions can be made at the end of the performance.
