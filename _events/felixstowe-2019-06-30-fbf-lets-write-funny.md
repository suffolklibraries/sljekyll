Do you like funny stories? Writer Ruth Fitzgerald tried to write serious stories for years but everything she wrote turned out funny. She found this very frustrating until, one day she had the brilliant idea of writing a funny book on purpose! The result was the hilarious Emily Sparkes series.

Come along to this workshop to hear about how Ruth writes funny stories and creates funny characters, then have a go at writing a funny story yourself. A guaranteed giggle-a-thon!

Writing materials will be provided.

Accompanying adults do not require a ticket.
