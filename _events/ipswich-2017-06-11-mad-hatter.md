Follow Cake and Revolution WI down the rabbit hole for an evening of surprises at the library. Enjoy cake, drinks (beer, wine and gin and cocktail bars), the best in music and entertainment and an excuse to wear your best hat.

There will also be a silent auction on the night with a chance to bid for fantastic local experiences provided by local businesses.

Over 18s only. All proceeds to be split between the WI and the library service.

[The Cake and Revolution WI group](https://www.facebook.com/CakeandRevolution/) is a newly-formed branch of the WI, which promotes itself as more ‘prosecco and body confidence’ than ‘jam and Jerusalem’. The group formed in September 2016 and has already attracted over 150 women.
