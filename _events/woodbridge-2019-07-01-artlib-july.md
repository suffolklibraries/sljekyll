Suffolk Creative Photographic Group was formed in 2011. It is forward-thinking and creative in its approach to photography, and not constrained by conventional camera club rules. Its members help and support one another to achieve individual and group goals by freely sharing their knowledge and skills with one another.

Group members proactively produce work for each others' assessment, competitions and exhibitions, and are inspired and helped to be more creative with bi-monthly projects. They are also encouraged to attain photographic distinctions and qualifications.

All members are equally responsible for, and have a say in, the running of the club. They take it in turns to host group meetings on the second Friday of each month, and there are also occasional committee meetings.
