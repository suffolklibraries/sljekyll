Matthew Bourne's smash-hit production, <cite>Sleeping Beauty</cite>, begins in 1890, at the christening of Princess Aurora in a Fin-de-Siècle period of fairies, vampires and decadent opulence. She grows into a young woman during the mythical Edwardian era, a golden age of long summer afternoons and croquet on the lawn.

Years later, awakening from her century-long slumber, Aurora finds herself in the modern day, a world more mysterious and wonderful than any fairy story!

A gothic romance that will delight dance fans of all ages.
