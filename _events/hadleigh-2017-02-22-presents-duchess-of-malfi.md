The widowed Duchess of Malfi longs to marry her lover, the steward Antonio.  But her rancorous brothers, Ferdinand and the Cardinal, are implacably opposed to the match.  When their spy, Bosola, discovers that the Duchess has secretly married and carries Antonio’s child, they exact a terrible and horrific revenge.

<cite>The Duchess of Malfi</cite>, featuring Hollywood star Gemma Arterton in the title role, is a thrilling combination of brilliant coups de theatre, horrific set-pieces and vivid characters, all lit by John Webster’s obsessional imagination.

This Globe on Screen production is the first ever theatrical production to be filmed entirely in candlelight.
