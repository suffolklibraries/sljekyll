Bestselling novelist Maggie O’Farrell is coming to Woodbridge Library, as a guest of Browsers Bookshop, to talk about her much-reviewed memoir [<cite>I Am, I Am, I Am</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2187161).

Maggie is a popular, award-winning writer and this book has attracted intense media attention. Maggie hasn't been keen to talk about her personal life or take part in events to promote her books until now. She chose to write this very revealing account of her life initially to support her young daughter, who experiences severe allergic reactions.

In <cite>I Am, I Am, I Am</cite>, Maggie looks at her life through the perspective of her 17 ‘near death’ experiences, and asks us all to ponder what we might do if we thought our life was in danger.

Ticket price includes a complimentary glass of wine and a £5 discount on a purchase of the book (RRP £18.99). Tickets are available from Browsers Bookshop, 60 Thoroughfare, Woodbridge, IP12 1AL. You can also buy a discounted book when you buy your ticket if you can't wait to read it.
