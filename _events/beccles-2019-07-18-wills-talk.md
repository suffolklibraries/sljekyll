Are you daunted and confused by topics such as intestacy, using trusts and tenants in common, leaving your money to a disabled person without affecting their benefits, inheritance tax, and Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA)? Steve Wilkes from Silver Lining Estate Planning is here to help with this afternoon talk.

Steve started Silver Lining in 2004, following a successful career catching drug smugglers as a custom and excise investigator. He is highly qualified in drafting wills, and a member of the Society of Will Writers.

No need to book, refreshments available.
