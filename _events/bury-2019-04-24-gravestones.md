Many famous, important, and even notorious people are buried in churchyards and cemeteries across Suffolk. But their gravestones are often overlooked or ignored. Robert Halliday, local historian and author, will give a fully illustrated talk about the gravestones of some famous people buried in Bury St Edmunds and other towns and villages around the county.
