excerpt: "The story of a motherless young boy who trades boxing gloves for ballet shoes against a backdrop of family strife and the 1984-5 miners' strike. Written by Lee Hall, directed by Stephen Daldry, choreographed by Peter Darling and scored by Elton John, Billy Elliott has made an extremely successful transition from screen to stage, winning several awards. Contains some strong language."
