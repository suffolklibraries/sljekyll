Kara Wright and Tien Tran, combat veterans of an elite intelligence unit, now make their living as Private Investigators. Often working the mundane, just occasionally they get to use all their former training. In <cite>Fall Guys</cite>:

> "When a break-in threatens Britain’s National Security, Franklyn calls on Wright & Tran but Kara will have to take this case on her own. Tien wants nothing to do with the world of Private Investigations and less to do with the world of Franklyn. Kara goes solo, but finding who is responsible for the break-in is the easy part. Finding who the real criminals are is much, much harder.

> "Isolated in a world of half-truths and lies, international arms deals and power politics, she is quick to discover that she’s been working for the wrong side. What she didn’t figure on was that making amends will place her, and those she loves, in the sights of those who have everything to lose."

Ian was born in Northern Ireland in 1966. At 18, he joined the Royal Air Force, rising through the ranks from aircraft technician to specialist electronic warfare duties and then intelligence officer. On leaving the Service he relocated to Western Australia and established a training and management consultancy. His rural home is surrounded by a resident mob of Kangaroos who bounce past his house each day. They remind him of his previous colleagues.

His first novel <cite>A Time To Every Purpose</cite>, an alternative history with a religious twist, was published in 2014 and gained positive critical acclaim. His Wright and Tran series of detective novels was launched with the publication of <cite>Face Value</cite> in 2015. The third in the series, <cite>Fall Guys/cite>, won the <cite>Publishers Weekly</cite> BookLife grand prize.
