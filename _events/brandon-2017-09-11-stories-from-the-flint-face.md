Ahead of the Fire and Flint Festival, use poetry to explore memories of local industries such as flint-knapping, forestry, and hat-making.

You will be encouraged to produce short prose or poems using fact sheets of local information, your own memories and stories, and stories gathered from interviews with local people in care homes.

Price includes tea and cake. You can attend [Suffolk Poetry Society workshop: Stories from the Flint Face](/events/brandon-2017-09-11-stories-from-the-flint-face/) as well for an extra £5.

**Please register by emailing membership@suffolkpoetrysociety.org.uk by Friday 8 September**
