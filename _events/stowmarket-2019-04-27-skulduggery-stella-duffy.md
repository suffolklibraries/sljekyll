Stella Duffy will talk about writing, getting started, keeping going, writing literary, historical, contemporary and crime fiction, changing the world one Fun Palace at a time and how to have a 35+ year career in the arts while never having a ‘proper’ job. Bring your questions!

Stella has written sixteen novels, written and devised fourteen plays and over seventy short stories, including several for BBC Radio 4. She has won the CWA Short Story Dagger and the Stonewall Writer of the Year awards twice, and been long-listed for the Orange Prize on two occasions. She is also the co-foundet and co-director of the [Fun Palaces](http://funpalaces.co.uk/) campaign, works as an actor and director, and is a regular speaker and campaigner around LGBTQ, women’s and arts equality and inclusion issues. She was awarded the OBE for Services to the Arts in 2016.
