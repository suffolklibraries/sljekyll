Hugely talented, award-winning singer-songwriter Steve Tilston presents an intimate evening of music, featuring unique arrangements of popular folk songs alongside his own critically acclaimed material.

Perhaps best known for his songwriting prowess, Steve is also a blinding, dazzling guitarist with a style echoing the elaborate rhythmic folk baroque of Bert Jansch and Davy Graham, but also drawing from classical, roots and the tradition to create a sound that has been called quintessentially Tilston.

Steve's latest solo CD, <cite>Truth To Tell</cite>, is out now.
