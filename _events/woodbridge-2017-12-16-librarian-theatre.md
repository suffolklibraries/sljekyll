Librarian Theatre will be performing their experimental new adaptation of <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, <cite>Alice in the Cuckoo's Nest</cite>.
This library tour is being partly funded by Arts Council England’s Grants for the Arts scheme.

<cite>Alice in the Cuckoo's Nest</cite> re-imagines Lewis Carroll's classic story in the setting of a modern day mental institution. Although the show is family friendly, it is a far cry from the innocent adventure portrayed in Walt Disney's 1951 film.

Children aged 8+ (accompanied by an adult) are very welcome; please note however that this is not a children’s show, and the production explores adult themes of mental health. The show lasts approximately one hour with no interval.

Tickets available online and through the library.
