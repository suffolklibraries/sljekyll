When Matthew Abercrombie got the job of theatre manager after nearly 30 years freelancing, his mum said 'is that a proper job at last?'

In this light-hearted and informative talk, Matthew will entertain you with stories of his work in theatre and corporate events, as well as facts, figures, suppositions and myths of theatre.
