Goodreads Debut of the Year 2016 Alwyn Hamilton will be in the Room at the Top discussing how she went from being an art historian to writing action adventure fantasy for young adults.

She will talk about how her first novel [<cite>Rebel of the Sands</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1793011) came to be after six full books that didn't cut the mustard, and what it means to build an entire world from scratch.
