Peter King is a Master Mariner and has had a distinguished nautical career. His new book, [<cite>The Aberdeen Line</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2201228), is the result of his personal interests and many years of research.

> "Founded in 1825 by the 21-year-old George Thompson Jnr, the Aberdeen Line developed over 100 years into one of the best-respected shipping lines in Britain. Initially traversing the short sea, Atlantic, South American, Far Eastern and Antipodean trade routes before settling to become the longest serving line on the Australian trade, the Aberdeen name navigated commercial take overs by the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, Shaw Savill and Albion, Lord Kylsant's Royal Mail Group and Furness Withy, before becoming all but forgotten when it finally furled its sails in 1957."

Ticket price includes a glass of a wine and nibbles.
