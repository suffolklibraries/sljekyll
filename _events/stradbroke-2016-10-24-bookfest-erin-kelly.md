Psychological thrillers continue to top the bestseller charts, and Erin has been writing in this field since 2007 so has vast insight. She’ll be revealing her writing tips as well as talking about how the genre mixes crime, women and literary fiction.

Erin is the award-winning writer of four psychological thrillers. Her first novel <cite>The Poison Tree</cite> was a Richard & Judy bestseller and a major ITV drama, and was partly set in Leiston. Her new book, due to be published in early 2017, is also set in Suffolk, in a fictional former asylum.

Erin was also chosen to write the novelisation of the BAFTA-winning tv drama <cite>Broadchurch</cite>, which has been an international bestseller.

She is a warm, engaging, informative and hugely entertaining speaker - don’t miss meeting her!

Refreshments will be on sale. Booksigning from 8.30pm.
