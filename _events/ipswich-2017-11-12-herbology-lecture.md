As part of the [Harry Potter: A History of Magic](https://www.bl.uk/projects/harry-potter-a-history-of-magic-public-library-displays) exhibition at the British Library, garden expert and author Anna Pavord will be drawing on her years working in gardens, and researching and writing about plants and their history.

Anna Pavord's books include her bestseller <cite>The Tulip</cite>, <cite>The Naming of Names</cite> and her most recent work, <cite>Landskipping</cite>. Anna's column in the <cite>Independent</cite> ran from the paperâ€™s launch in 1986 and for many years she was an Associate Editor of the magazine <cite>Gardens Illustrated</cite>. Anna served for ten years on the Gardens Panel of the National Trust, the last five as chairman. She also served three three-year terms on English Heritage's Parks and Gardens Panel. In 2001 she was awarded the Gold Veitch medal from the Royal Horticultural Society. For more than 40 years she has lived in Dorset where she gardens on a steep sunny slope among arisaemas and magnolias.
