Pre-school children and their parents/carers are invited to a taster of <cite>The Musical Puzzle</cite> with early years music leader Claire Henry and musicians from the City of London Sinfonia. Expect musical games, storytelling, singing, clapping and moving to music! No musical experience is required and parents and carers are encouraged to join in.

You can catch the full concert at Haverhill Arts Centre on Monday 22 October at 10:30am.
