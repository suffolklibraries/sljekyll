Ellis Lacey (Ronan) emigrates from her native Ireland in 1951 to Brooklyn, New York in search of a new life and greater opportunity. There she meets a young Italian American with whom she forms a close bond (and shares her first experience of Italian food) before her past catches up with her and necessitating a return to her roots and unforeseen complications.

Food inspired by the film will be provided by Applaud Coffee and available to purchase after the screening.
