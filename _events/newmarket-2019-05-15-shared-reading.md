Would you like to help transform rehabilitation for local people by being part of our Shared Reading project?

Shared Reading brings people together to connect through stories and poems, develops confidence, and improves wellbeing. The Reader is looking for volunteers in Newmarket to train to lead Shared Reading groups. Volunteers receive a transformative training course, plus an ongoing support package.

Email **heidihollis@thereader.org.uk** or **kate.ashton@suffolklibraries.co.uk** or call [07484 006302](tel:07484006302) for more information.
