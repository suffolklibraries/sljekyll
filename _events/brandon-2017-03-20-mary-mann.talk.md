Sue Dean will be presenting a talk on the life and work of early 20th century Norfolk Author Mary Mann. Members of the public are very welcome to join the Brandon Circle and our two book groups for the talk.

Mary wrote novels and short stories about the villages she knew well and loved. Her tales of 'Dulditch' drew admiration from other authors such as D.H. Lawrence. Come and find out more about this well-loved writer and why she deserves a wider audience.

There will be tea and coffee for sale courtesy of the Friends of Brandon Library.
