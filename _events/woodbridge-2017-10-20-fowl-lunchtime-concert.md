Dave Tricker is a local singer and instrumentalist. He attended Woodbridge County Primary School (now Woodbridge Library) and Farlingaye High School.

Musically, he cut his teeth playing in the Red Lion Thursday night folk sessions of the late 70s and early 80s. After seven years away from Woodbridge he returned in 1987 and has played in various bands and duos since and is a resident of the Everyman Folk Club.

Dave’s style has been influenced by Bluegrass, Americana and British folk but he has come to the conclusion that “a good song is a good song” regardless of style.

As well as performing, Dave also has an interest in instrument building – particularly arch top mandolins - and plays some of his own instruments.

The performance will include songs (some of his own) and tunes played on the mandolin.
