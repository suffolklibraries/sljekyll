All friends of Halesworth Library are invited to attend our Annual General Meeting. Your attendance is important to us.

Our guest speaker will be Sylvia Knights, who works at Bungay Library and is the vice-chair of the Board of Suffolk Libraries. She will give an overview of the current position and future developments and will welcome questions.
