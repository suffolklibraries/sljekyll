Hailed as ‘a masterpiece of 21st century dance', Akram Khan’s <cite>Giselle</cite> features Artistic Director Tamara Rojo dancing the role of Giselle, one of a community of migrant workers cast out of their jobs in a condemned garment factory.

The classic story of love, betrayal and redemption has been reimagined in this stunning new version, with sets and costumes by Academy-Award winning designer Tim Yip (<cite>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</cite>), an ‘ominous, gothic’ (<cite>The Observer</cite>) adaptation of Adolphe Adam’s original score by composer Vincenzo Lamagna and performance by English National Ballet Philharmonic.
