Children aged 4-11 and their parents/carers are invited to an interactive family show from poet Justin Coe. Experience poems from his critically acclaimed book [<cite>The Dictionary of Dads</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2144324), forthcoming book <cite>The Magic of Mums</cite> and some spectacularly spooky Halloween poems and have a go at creating (and performing, if you like!) your comic poem.
