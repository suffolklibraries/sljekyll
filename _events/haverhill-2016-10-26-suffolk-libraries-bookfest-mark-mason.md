**A fascinating and entertaining evening discovering astonishing facts about Britain with trivia guru Mark Mason.**

Mark has written numerous books celebrating his love of trivia and exploring why some of us are good at remembering seemingly useless bits of information, and others rely more heavily on Google.

"Before becoming a writer,‚Äù he says, "I did jobs as varied as selling Christmas cards in Harrods, playing guitar in a blues band that toured Europe, and making radio programmes for the BBC. Wherever I went, though, I found it was always the trivia that excited me most. The intriguing stuff, the little facts that slip down the back of life's sofa. So I've ended up as the sort of guy who knows that Harrods dropped their apostrophe in 1921 (Sainsbury's still haven't)&hellip;  that Istanbul is the only city in the world to straddle two continents&hellip; that The Archers theme tune was produced by a young George Martin&hellip; It's an attitude that keeps life interesting!"

For his latest book, <cite>Mail Obsession</cite>, Mark talks about his travels round Britain collecting a fascinating fact from each of the UK's 124 postcode areas, and delves into the history of our postal service.

Find out what the Queen keeps in her handbag, how Jimi Hendrix got confused by the M1 and why the Jack Russell has a white coat.

There are gems to discover about Suffolk, too, and astonishing things about to learn about libraries, authors and books. And you might like to share some trivial knowledge of your own.

It'll be a really entertaining evening. Mark is great fun. You'll come away with loads of stories to delight and baffle your friends and family, and some Christmas present purchases too?!
