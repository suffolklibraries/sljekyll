Caroline Goldsworthy will be talking about her debut novel, <cite>Tangent</cite>. The first in a series about DCI Ronald Carlson, it was inspired by her experience of living in Ipswich during the tragic events of December 2006.

Caroline grew up in Colchester, moving to Suffolk in late 2006. Returning to formal education in her early thirties, she graduated with a BA in Spanish Language and Linguistics from the University of Essex and won a full scholarship for an MA in Language Acquisition. It was during this time that she discovered she really liked writing. For the last few years she has been working as a programme manager in telecommunications while writing her first novel.
