Circle 67 invite us back to 17th century Paris where Orgon, an ageing, self-righteous, rich man is worrying about his place in heaven. He becomes besotted with Tartuffe, an imposter and religious hypocrite who worms his way into Orgon’s household.

Orgon behaves more and more irrationally, offering Tartuffe his money and his daughter - but Tartuffe fancies someone else...

With his family in uproar, the scales finally fall from Orgon’s eyes - but is it too late?
