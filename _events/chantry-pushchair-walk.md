Wrap up warm and wear boots or wellies for our pre-Christmas pushchair health walk. Enjoy a refreshing walk, chat and make new friends.

Ticket price includes drinks, Christmas cake and festive refreshments at the library afterwards.

No need to book - just turn up. If the weather is bad on the day, call the library on [01473 927275](tel:01473927275) to check whether we're still going ahead.
