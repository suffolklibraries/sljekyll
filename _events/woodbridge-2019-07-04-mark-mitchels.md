Join us for one of accomplished Suffolk speaker Mark Mitchels' last public talks before he retires later this year.

Mark is well known as an entertaining speaker on a range of subjects covering history, geography, culture and his beloved East Anglia. He says that 'there are few more satisfying experiences than reading a thoroughly amusing book', and will be speaking about 'just a few of the titles that keep on going, delighting generation after generation'.

After a career teaching English and history and being Head of Cultural Studies at Woodbridge School, Mark has become extremely well-known as a lecturer on a wide range of topics. His engaging, relaxed style is much praised.

Ticket price includes a drink on arrival.
