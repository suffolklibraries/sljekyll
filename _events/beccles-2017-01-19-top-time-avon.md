In 1886, 34 years before women in the US earned the right to vote, David H. McConnell, helped give them the chance to earn an independent income. McConnell was a traveling book salesman and offered beauty products as an additional perk to his female customers. He saw that these women were more interested in the free perfume samples than the books. Since the women had a passion for his products and loved networking with other women, McConnell was inspired to recruit them as sales representatives for his new-found company. From a small New York City office, McConnell himself mixed the company's first fragrances.

Thus began Avonâ€™s long history of empowering women around the globe.

Avon UK opened in 1959 and today there are about 160,000 reps in Britain.

Come along and hear their story.
