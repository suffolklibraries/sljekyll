The Friends of Glemsford Library (FoGL) have invited authors Nicola Upson and Mandy Morton to talk about their latest detective novels at Glemsford Village Hall.

Nicola Upson's most recent novel is [<cite>London Rain</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1763254):

> "May, 1937, and London prepares to crown a new king. Bestselling writer Josephine Tey is in town to oversee a BBC radio production of her play, but adultery, treachery and pent-up jealousies are stalking the corridors of Broadcasting House.

> "At the height of the Coronation celebrations, Detective Chief Inspector Archie Penrose is called in to investigate the murder of one of the BBC's best-known broadcasters. A second victim - his mistress, and the play's leading actress - suggests that the motive lies close to home, but Josephine suspects that the killings are linked to a decade-old scandal. With Archie's hands tied by politics, and his attention taken by another, seemingly unrelated death, it is left to Josephine to get to the truth."

Mandy Morton's latest novel is [<cite>The Ghost of Christmas Paws</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2038480):

> "It's a week before Christmas and Hettie and Tilly set out on a very dangerous case for The No. 2 Feline Detective Agency. Lady Eloise Crabstock-Singe has summoned them to Crabstock Manor in the village of Porthladle on the Cornish Coast to solve the mystery of Christmas Paws, a servant cat who haunts the Manor intent on killing off all the Crabstocks.

> "Should they put their trust in Absalom and Lamorna Tweek? Will Saffron Bunn's cooking get any better? And what is Evergreen Flinch searching for? Through blizzard and storm, stranded on the notorious Bodkin Moor and laid up at Jam Makers' Inn, will Hettie and Tilly save the day and get home in time for Christmas dinner?"
