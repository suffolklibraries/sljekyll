April is Dragon Month at Sudbury Library! We've put together a limited number of dragon activity bags including two craft activities, puzzles and more so you can get involved and beat holiday boredom.

Keep an eye on the [Sudbury Library webpage](/libraries/sudbury-library/) for details about our Dragon Month events, including a dragon egg hunt!
