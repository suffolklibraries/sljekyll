Falling madly in love with each other, Romeo and Juliet’s amorous affair is swiftly derailed by their families, the Montagues and the Capulets. A long-standing feud between them threatens to tear the lovers apart, and will have devastating consequences for both families.

Kenneth Branagh directs a new vision of Shakespeare’s heartbreaking tragedy, a passionate, modern production that aims to delight enthusiasts and reach out to younger audiences.
