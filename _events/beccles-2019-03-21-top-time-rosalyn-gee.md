Rosalyn settled into Kessingland village life several years ago, and although she made friends, she sometimes felt lonely. Then Betsy turned up and changed her life completely. Now every day is an adventure, and by reading her book and coming to the talk, you will see what mischief Betsy gets up to!

No need to book, refreshments provided.
