Join experienced writer and tutor Greg Mosse in a collaborative, supportive story development workshop for playwrights at all stages of the writing journey. He’ll help you establish characters and setting, identifying conflicts and challenges. Above all, he will help you develop a sense of narrative structure in individual dialogues, complete scenes – and in your script as a whole.
