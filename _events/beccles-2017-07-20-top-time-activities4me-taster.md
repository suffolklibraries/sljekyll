Activities4Me is an ActivLives project offering FREE activity taster sessions throughout the summer for people aged 55 years and over living in or around Southwold, Halesworth, Beccles and Bungay.

These fun, lighthearted sessions will include popular sport activities such as New Age Kurling and Boccia.

As part of these sessions, ActivLives will also be researching how people keep active and what activities could be developed in the area in the future.
