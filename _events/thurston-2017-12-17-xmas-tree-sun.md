St Peter's Church and The Friends of Thurston Library present The Thurston Christmas Tree Festival 2017.

Back by popular demand, this will be a really special Christmas weekend. Families, groups, businesses and organisations will be invited to decorate a tree to be displayed in the church or library.

There will be children's activities and events at both venues and seasonal refreshments in the church, and all are welcome to the church's carol service at 3pm on Sunday.

For further information, contact Richard Fawcett on [01359 231363](tel:01359231363) or Irene Churchus on [01359 230652](tel:01359230652).
