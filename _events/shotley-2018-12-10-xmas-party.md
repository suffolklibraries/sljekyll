The weekly Shotley Library at Shotley Village Hall has had over 3,000 visits and lent over 4,500 books to visitors since its launch in April 2017!

Help us to celebrate this milestone, and the festive period, at our Christmas party. There will be free mince pies and other refreshments along with festive songs and crafts.

The pre-school singing and stories session will be on as usual from 2:15-2:45pm.
