16-22 September is Infant Massage Awareness Week. Why not bring your baby along to the library and experience the benefits for yourself with Lucy from Bodies, Bumps and Babies? You can also find out what your local library has to offer and pick up a free book bag for your baby!

Massage should be avoided for 24 hours after immunisations. If your baby has any complex health needs, it is suggested to you talk to your midwife/health visitor for advice first.

Sign up in advance for a session at 10am, 10:30am or 11am.
