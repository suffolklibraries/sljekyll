As part of the [Harry Potter: A History of Magic](https://www.bl.uk/projects/harry-potter-a-history-of-magic-public-library-displays) exhibition at the British Library, physicist Maggie Aderin-Pocock will be talking about space, her current research, and what drew her to study science in the first place.

Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock MBE is a space scientist whose passion is presenting science to a general audience and demonstrating that you ‘don’t need a brain the size of a small planet’ to understand, participate in and enjoy science. Her BBC2 programme, <cite>Do We Really Need the Moon?</cite> showed just that. The programme earned Maggie the talkback Thames new talent award at the prestigious Women in Film and TV Awards in December 2011. She is currently presenting <cite>The Sky at Night</cite> on BBC 4, <cite>Mini Stargazing</cite> for Cbeebies and is a panellist on Sky One’s science quiz show, <cite>Ducks Quacks Don’t Echo</cite>.

Maggie studied at Imperial College where she obtained her degree in Physics and her PhD in Mechanical Engineering. Since then she has spent much of her career making novel, bespoke instrumentation ranging from hand-held land mine detectors to an optical subsystem for the James Webb Space Telescope. To further share her love of science Maggie conducts Tours of the Universe and other public engagement activities, showing school children and adults around the world the wonders of space.
