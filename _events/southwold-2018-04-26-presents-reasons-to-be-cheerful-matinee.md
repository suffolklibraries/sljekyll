Celebrating the infectious music of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, <cite>Reasons to be Cheerful</cite> is a punk rock musical and gritty coming-of-age tale which always leaves audiences shouting for more.

It’s 1979: Labour loses to the Tories, strikes rock the nation and Ian Dury and the Blockheads’ <cite>Reasons to be Cheerful (Part 3)</cite> climbs the charts. As the ultimate fans, Vinnie and his mates would do anything to see Dury at the Hammersmith Odeon, only the gig is sold out. But life has a habit of throwing strange things at you, and one night of frustration becomes something else entirely...

Tickets available from Southwold Library and Southwold Arts Centre
