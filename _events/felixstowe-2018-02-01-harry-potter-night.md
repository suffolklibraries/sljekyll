This Harry Potter Book Night, everyone over the age of 7 is invited to test their Harry Potter knowledge. As well as fun questions to answer about Harry's adventures, there will be entertainment from the Rapscallion Theatre Company. You can also take a look at our [British Library Harry Potter: A History of Magic display](/events/felixstowe-2018-01-05-history-of-magic/).

Come in a team of 6 or we'll match you up on the night.

Dressing up is encouraged!

Tickets must be booked in advance by contacting the library.
