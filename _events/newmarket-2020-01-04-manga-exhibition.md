Drop in to see some of the work of local artist and author [Irina Richards](https://www.irinarichards.com/).

Irina is a graphic storyteller whose art conveys stories - her own and those of other people and places. Her artistic practice draws influences from diverse visual narrative traditions, including Japanese manga, with its characteristic focus on the realms of the personal and the emotional. She investigates life experiences, human relationships and connections with the world around us and uses the comic/graphic novel medium to deal with sensitive issues. As well as creating her own art, Irina teaches people of all ages to make their own manga/comics.
