Drop in to the library on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) and help us celebrate and raise funds for the library:

* Children can enjoy a bouncy castle courtesy of Capel Castles, as well as storytimes at 10am and 1pm
* Pick up some lovely knitted badges made by our Knit & Knatter group and felt bookmarks made by one of our volunteers
* Talk to Capel Parish Nurses about the services they offer in the library and the Friends of Capel Library about what they do and how you can get involved
* Guess the number of Lego bricks in the jar (£1 a go, prize donated by Drayton Insurance), guess the number of pages in the book (£1 a go) and enter the Capel Parish Nurses' raffle
* Relax with tea, coffee and cakes for a donation.
