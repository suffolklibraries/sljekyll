Alison Bruce will be talking about her work, including the DC Gary Goodhew novels, and her career as a crime writer.

<img src="/images/featured/featured-alison-bruce.jpg" alt="Alison Bruce" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

Alison has written eight crime novels and two non-fiction titles. Her first novel, [<cite>Cambridge Blue</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=591618) was described by <cite>Publishers Weekly</cite> as an ‘assured debut’ and introduced both DC Gary Goodhew and her trademark Cambridge setting. The series comprises seven books; Alison's latest release is the standalone psychological thriller [<cite>I Did It For Us</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2164582).

Alison was born in Croydon and grew up in Wiltshire before moving to Cambridgeshire in 1998. She worked as an electroplater, taxi driver and band promoter and spent ten years working in the IT industry before leaving to concentrate on completing her first novel. She also teaches creative writing at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Alison is a proud supporter of local libraries and is the patron of [Lakenheath Library](/libraries/lakenheath-library/).
