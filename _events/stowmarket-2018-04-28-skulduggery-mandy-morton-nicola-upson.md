Nicola Upson and Mandy Morton will be giving us an insight into the writing of two very different series of crime novels.

Mandy's successful and playful books about The No. 2 Feline Detective Agency feature the trials and tribulations of the tabby cat Hettie Bagshot and her sidekick Tilly. The latest book in the series is [<cite>The Michaelmas Murders</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2190646) and Mandy is currently working on the sixth.

Mandy was born in Framlingham, Suffolk, and pursued a successful music recording career before joining the BBC to produce and present arts-based programmes. She co-presents <cite>The Eclectic Light Show</cite> with Nicola on Cambridge 105 Radio.

Nicola's new novel, [<cite>Nine Lessons</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2263788), is the seventh in her bestselling series featuring the Golden Age writer Josephine Tey. Set in the winter of 1937, and featuring a series of baffling murders inspired by M.R. James's famous ghost stories, the book takes readers on a gripping journey from King's College, Cambridge to the bleak, atmospheric Suffolk coast, where some of James's greatest tales are set.

Nicola was born in Suffolk and read English at Downing College, Cambridge. She has worked in theatre and as a freelance journalist, and is the author of two works of non-fiction.
