Between Thursday 1 and Friday 16 December, for Â£2 you can write a letter to Father Christmas and post it in our special 'North Pole' letter box. Father Christmas will personally give you a letter in return after a [special Christmas Storytime on Tuesday 20 December](/events/haverhill-2016-12-20-xmas-storytime/).

If you are unable to meet Father Christmas on 20 December, you will be able to pick up his letter to you from Wednesday 21 December.
