Beth Taylor has stitched for as long as she can remember. Always attuned to the natural world, she is influenced by the colours and forms of the countryside. Often it is cloth itself, whether from our own rich heritage or that of other cultures, which inspires, sparks off an idea, seeks expression in the form of clothing. Her studio space provides the opportunity to explore this process with results which are intended to surprise, delight and inspire.
