A special event to celebrate and acknowledge all the hard work that family carers do for family and friends is being held at Beccles Library on Thursday 15 June.

The event is designed to support carersâ€™ health and wellbeing and will be held in The Glass Room.

Everyone is welcome to come along. If you are supporting and caring for a family member or friend this may be of particular interest to you. There will be talks throughout the day from mental health professionals, and stalls providing information, carer assessments, support groups and where carers can go for support and advice. There will also be inspirational talks from other carers.

The event is being organised by the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust and Feedback Health.
