Join us for a screening of <cite>Swimming with Men</cite>:

> "When middle-aged Eric Scott (Rob Brydon) realises his life is missing some excitement, he joins a local group of men who escape from their mundane lives by practising synchronised swimming. When his ambition pushes the rest of the team to train harder they realise they could have what it takes to compete in the British championships."
