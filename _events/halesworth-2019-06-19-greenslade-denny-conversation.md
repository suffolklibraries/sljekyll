Between them Fiona Denny and Ash Greenslade have written and published more than 10 books - fiction, non-fiction, even poetry.

They will be talking about the writing process: how and when they write, what inspires them, what drives them, how they create plot and character, and why Suffolk features so strongly in their books. Despite being cousins and authors, their styles are very different, as is their approach to writing.

Come and share in the discussion, ask questions and tell your own writing stories.

Refreshments will be provided and Ash and Fiona will be available to sign copies of their books
