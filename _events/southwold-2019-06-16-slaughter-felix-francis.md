Felix Francis will be talking about his latest novel, <cite>Crisis</cite>, and his other novels that continue his late father Dick Francis' writing legacy.

Felix and Dick worked together on Dick's novels for three decades, developing plot and character details together and drawing upon Felix's knowledge and experience as an international marksman and physicist. Felix gradually took on a more significant role in writing, and has continued to publish a new 'Dick Francis' story every autumn since his father's death in 2010. His next novel, <cite>Guilty Not Guilty</cite>, is due out in September.
