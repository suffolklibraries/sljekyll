Will this be the funkiest event to have ever taken place in library anywhere ever? Quite possibly!

We're delighted to welcome the 12 piece funk band Primo Nelson to Ipswich Library, supported by the awesome acoustic groove band Spacecake. Primo Nelson are an original, hard hitting, funk inspired, groove movement of heavy horns, ripping riffs through a thumping funk core, husky tones and so much more!

Spacecake are possibly the funkiest acoustic band you'll ever see. The 6-piece outfit play various acoustic and folk instruments, but their music is more funky than folky.

There will also be a reasonably priced licensed bar at the event selling real ales, lager, wine and soft drinks.

EARLY BIRD TICKET OFFER: Just £5 each before 31st July.
After that, £8 each or two for £14.

Tickets are available over the counter at Ipswich Library, or online (subject to booking fee).
