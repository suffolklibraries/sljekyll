Drop in to the library to view a collection of drawings and paintings on a range of themes, from Martha Stewart’s peppermint fudge to the beauty of the bergamot, from Toscanini as an Englishman to the joy of swedes.

Artist Michael Richards has always drawn, but over the past two decades, art has become a huge part of his life and he has attended workshops and courses by Annie Rice, Ed Cooper, Annabel Mednick, Helen Gilbart and Emily Ball. He works full-time for a Suffolk book publisher and paints and draws during evenings and weekends:

> "At the moment I don’t have to live from my art which gives me the freedom to explore ... Although I’d love to see my work hanging in the Redfern Gallery in London or Thompson’s in Aldeburgh, at least I don’t have anyone complaining if I suddenly go off at a tangent and start drawing dogs with household objects for noses..."

> "I’ve always found that the medium dictates my style. Painting in acrylics makes me want to paint in layers, effective for still life paintings such as Bergamot in this exhibition. Pen and ink is less forgiving, more precise, so I use it for illustration and drawing from the imagination. Pencil is more delicate, allowing intricate shading and the layering of tones while pastel is ‘drawing as painting’, giving the opportunity to produce work that lies somewhere between the two."

In 2010 Michael illustrated <cite>Inside Conducting</cite> by Christopher Seaman, conductor emeritus of the Rochester Symphony Orchestra in the US, and in 2016 he won a prize for one of his submissions to his first exhibition, with the Society of Graphic Fine Art in London.
