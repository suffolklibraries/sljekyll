Author Margaret Moore will be talking about her novel [<cite>A Street of Secrets</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2244193):

> "Set in the East End of London, Angel Street is home to a variety of characters, who live close together, sharing each other's joys, tears and lives. Ethel's collision with Stan's bicycle raises eyebrows. Why do Stan's solicitors insist on involving the rent collector in his affairs? Then there is Rose, who appears to be teaching the vicar some of her old ways. When Churchy and Liz decide to investigate, they find more than they bargained for. The next vicar comes as another shock. Meanwhile young Tony is unwittingly apprenticed to burglars, causing problems for one or two other local residents. The new neighbour is a real eye-opener, and what about the mystery lady who stands watching on the corner?"

Margaret Moore was born in the East End of London during the war years. She began her writing career with a children's book. She lives in Suffolk with husband Norman.
