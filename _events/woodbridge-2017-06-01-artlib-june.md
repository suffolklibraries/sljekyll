Anthony spent 45 years as a commercial interior designer working all over the world. Having relocated to Suffolk in 2000, Anthonyâ€™s past interest in photography and painting was reawakened.

Having now fully retired, and after a very informative and challenging four years' membership of the Ipswich and District Photographic Society, Anthony now has a wider appreciation for the natural delights and unique features of Suffolk, especially the nautical wrecks along the wonderful waterways of the Suffolk coastal regions.

Whilst working with the photographic images printed on canvas, together with various photo commissions for the <cite>Woodbridge Society</cite> magazine and Woodbridge in Bloom charity work, Anthony was also inspired to use his vast stock of images to create paintings of similar nautical and waterway subjects using acrylic on canvas and board. These can now be viewed at this individual exhibition at the Woodbridge Library Gallery - hopefully the first of many!
