Ipswich Library and Suffolk Mind would like to tell you some stories that will help you understand your emotional and physical needs.

The idea is that you bring your dad (or your grandad, a male relative or carer) and we all sit down and listen to some interactive storytelling by a GIANT storyteller called Ezra (You don’t need to be worried that Ezra is a giant – because he’s a friendly one!)

As well as the stories, Ezra will teach you how to calm down when you’re annoyed, by breathing like a dragon AND you get a colouring book so that you can draw pictures about how it feels when you are safe.

**Free to attend Suitable for 6-11 years. Refreshments provided.**
