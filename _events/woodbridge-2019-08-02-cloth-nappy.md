Suffolk Cloth Nappies are a small team of volunteer parents who want to support local families choosing to use reusable nappies. They offer free hire kits, so if you are thinking of trying cloth nappies, come along.

Hiring a kit will help you find the right nappies for your child, and show you how simple the whole process is. The volunteers are happy to answer questions and provide information and resources.

No need to book, just turn up.
