Come along to our first sewing bee session and see what it's all about.  Open to all, whether you've never sewn before or are a sewing expert.

Over two weekly sessions in term time, these sessions offer you the chance to complete a sewing project with full guidance and instruction and all materials provided for Â£10. 

Refreshments available for a small donation.
