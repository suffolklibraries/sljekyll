Charlie Hart is a gardener and garden writer living on the Essex/Suffolk Border. He worked on the Modern Slavery Garden at the Chelsea flower show 2016.

[<cite>Skymeadow</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2351002) is the story of how Charlie singlehandedly built a five-acre garden from scratch; it is a gardening memoir which celebrates the healing effects of nature on mental health.

> “In Skymeadow, Charlie seamlessly weaves together his own memoir with that of his garden. The result is a lyrical and incisive story of mental health at an all-time low, the healing powers of digging and, ultimately, a celebration of nature.”

Ticket price includes a glass of wine.
