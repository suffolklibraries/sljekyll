11-25 year-olds are invited to a special art session! Working with artist Kristy Campbell, you will be designing two murals for Lowestoft Library. We want a mash up of all of your ideas, memories and favourite places in Lowestoft to create a personal patchwork of the town.

This event is free, but contact the library to book your space.

All equipment and refreshments will be provided. We look forward to seeing you!

This event is part of our [BLOC Youth Arts programme](/bloc/)
