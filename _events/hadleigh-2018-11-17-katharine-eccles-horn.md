Children and their parents/carers are invited to join us for a talk and signing from East Anglian writer Katharine Eccles Horn, author of <cite>Dogs Can't Fly</cite> and <cite>Dragons on Ice</cite>.

In <cite>Dragons on Ice</cite>, eleven-year-old Danny receives a new mischievous pet and together the two head off on an adventure which leads them to another world, one which is ruled by warring dragons.
