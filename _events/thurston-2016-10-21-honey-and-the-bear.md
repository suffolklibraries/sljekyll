[Honey &amp; The Bear](http://www.honeyandthebear.co.uk/) are a popular, roots inspired local duo. They softly interweave vocal harmonies and foot stomping rhythms, combining elements of folk, Americana, country, blues and whatever else takes their fancy.

They comprise instrumentalist pair Jon Hart and Lucy Sampson, and have been writing together since early 2014, performing at local festivals including Maverick and FolkEast in 2015. They have just released their debut EP <cite>About Time</cite>.
