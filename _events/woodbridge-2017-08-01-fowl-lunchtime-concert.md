This family band hailing from the Bawdsey Peninsula offers a beguiling mix of contemporary and traditional acoustic music, featuring tight vocal harmonies and beautifully played arrangements of well chosen songs.  

Ross is an accomplished guitarist and singer and his partner Ali adds ethereal vocals and flute. Their 16-year-old daughter Eliza wins new admirers wherever she plays with her fluent and assured violin playing and singing and they are now also joined by their son, 13-year-old Sam, a very talented cellist and guitarist.
