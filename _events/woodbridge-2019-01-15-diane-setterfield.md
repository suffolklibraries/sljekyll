See best-selling author Diane Setterfield in conversation with journalist Catherine Larner, and be among the first to buy and read her new book before its official publication.

Diane is best known for <cite>The Thirteenth Tale</cite>, a dark and haunting novel which was adapted for television, starring Olivia Coleman and Vanessa Redgrave. Her new book, <cite>Once Upon a River</cite>, is a wonderfully atmospheric and intriguing gothic mystery set along the river Thames.
