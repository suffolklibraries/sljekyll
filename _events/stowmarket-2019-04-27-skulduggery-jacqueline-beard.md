Jacqueline Beard will be talking about her Victorian murder mysteries, based on true Suffolk crimes.

Jacqueline is a writer and genealogist living in Gloucestershire but with an East Anglian ancestry going back to the 1500s. Her books are a mixture of true crime and fiction. Her newest and darkest book, <cite>The Ripper Deception</cite>, was inspired by local Suffolk newspaper reports.

When Jacqueline is not writing or researching “dead people” as her husband so charmingly puts it, she can be found walking in the glorious Cotswolds. Jacqueline loves technology and spends far too much time on her computer. She hates flying, dentists and balloons – especially red ones.
