Adults are invited to try a new hobby by having a go at felting.

Booking essential. If you attend this event, you may not have attended our flower-arranging workshop on Saturday 23 September, or be planning to attend our [watercolour](/events/framlingham-2017-10-21-watercolour/) or [pen and ink](/events/framlingham-2017-10-28-pen-and-ink/) workshops.
