Join us for some crafts and animal facts with the Suffolk Wildlife Trust. We'll have easier crafts for toddlers and their parents/carers and some more challenging ones for primary school-aged children.

There might even be the chance to meet a hedgehog!

Ticket price includes a drink and biscuit. Pay in advance at the library or on the door.
