Join us for an amazing night of music at the library.

**Morganway** was founded by twin brothers Callum (vocals/guitar) and Kieran Morgan (lead guitar). Its fiery sound and distinctive Americana glow wears its heart on its sleeve, packing charismatic five-part harmonies and powerful riffs into the emotional songwriting. They are joined by SJ Mortimer (vocals), Nicole Terry (fiddle), Matthew Brocklehurst (keys), Rory Hill (bass) and Ed Bullinger (drums).

In 2017, Morganway caught the ear of Britain’s country music champion, Whispering Bob Harris. Following a live session at his Under The Apple Tree home studio, they were invited to headline the UTAT stage at Silverstone. The band also supported The Shires at Taverham Hall to a crowd of 4000 and were later nominated for a BCMA award. Throughout 2018 the band has been touring extensively building momentum, with a summer packed full of festivals such as Buckle & Boots and Cambridge Folk Festival. They have also been busy recording their debut album, mixed in Nashville, which is set to be released in early 2019.

**Hanna Haas** is a singer-songwriter operating out of the same San Francisco scene that brought us Marty O’Reilly & The Old Soul Orchestra and The Rainbow Girls. She visits Ipswich as part of her current European tour.

**Helen and the Neighbourhood Dogs** are the UK’s premier exponents of the East Angliacana movement. They sing songs, bring joy, eat supper and do a lot of work for charity, often on behalf of others.

There will be a licensed bar selling beer, wine, cider and soft drinks. Tickets can be bought in advance online or at the ground floor library counter, or on the door.
