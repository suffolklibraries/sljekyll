Another popular speaker returns to our Wednesday Talk session! Tiffani will examine the source for the English cottage garden style, its often tenuous connection to history, and its stronger connection to national identity.

Accompanied by illustrations, she will also discuss the continuing legacy of the English cottage garden style via art, architecture, and literature from the 19th century to the present day.
