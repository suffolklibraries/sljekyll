Suffolk Creative Photographic Group was formed in early 2011 by a group of photographers whose aims are to be forward-thinking and creative in photography, help each other and freely share their knowledge and skills. Bi-monthly projects are set to encourage and aid members to produce creative work.

All members of the group are equally responsible for its running and are proactive in producing monthly work for assessment, entering competitions and exhibitions. Everything that affects the group must have the approval of all the members. The attainment of photographic distinctions and qualifications are encouraged.
