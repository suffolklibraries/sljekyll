> "When the Velveteen Rabbit is unwrapped on Christmas morning, he quickly becomes just another thing gathering dust in the toy box. Shunned by the other playthings, who are braver, more glamorous and have expensive motors and ﬂashing lights, he fears he’ll never be played with. But a chance encounter makes him the favourite toy, and with a little magic and a lot of love, he might even become real! "

This spring, Spinning Wheel Theatre brings this beautiful tale to life on stage by two actors, inventive puppetry and original songs. A joyful and uplifting tale of magic, friendship and hope, this is a show for all the family to enjoy!

The show’s content is suitable for any age, so it's down to parental discretion whether a very young child will comfortably be able to sit for nearly an hour. However, the setting is quite relaxed - the company don’t use lighting in this production, so it isn’t your traditional ‘lights out, sit in silence’ set-up, and they have worked with an accessibility specialist to ensure it us suitable for visually-impaired children. There are moments when children will be encouraged to join in with a song or actions!
