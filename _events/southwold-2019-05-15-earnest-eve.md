Join us for a ‘brilliantly funny’ and ‘charming’ production of one of the funniest plays in English, Oscar Wilde’s <cite>The Importance of Being Earnest</cite>, filmed live at the Vaudeville Theatre in London’s West End. Wilde’s much-loved masterpiece throws love, logic and language into the air to make one of theatre’s most dazzling firework displays. Jack, Algy, Gwendolyn and Cecily discover how unsmooth runs the course of true love, while Lady Bracknell keeps a baleful eye on the mayhem of manners.

Michael Fentiman’s ‘absolutely hilarious’ adaptation stars Olivier Award winner Sophie Thompson and Jeremy Swift alongside Fiona Button, Pippa Nixon and Stella Gonet.
