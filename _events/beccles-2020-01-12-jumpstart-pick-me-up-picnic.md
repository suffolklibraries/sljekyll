We're rolling out the blankets for a community picnic. Everyone is invited to bring along a lunch box or picnic and enjoy colouring in while chatting and making new friends.

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.
