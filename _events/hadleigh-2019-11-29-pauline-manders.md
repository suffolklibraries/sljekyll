Drop in and meet Pauline Manders, author of the Suffolk-based Utterly Crime series. Her latest, [<cite>Utterly Roasted</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2530599) is the eighth in the series. It stands alone but we see the return of many characters met before:

> "It is August 2013 and Chrissie Jax and D.I. Clive Merry return to Suffolk from a short break in Amsterdam. Within a week, two bodies are delivered to the morgue and the international spotlight is on Clive and his investigation. Tension mounts as a tangled web of car paint re-spraying, a catering outfit, pike fishing and chocolate draws in long term friends Matt and Nick. Chrissie becomes part of the investigation in a way not one could have predicted. The action moves from Alton Water to Ipswich; Bury St Edmunds to Felixstowe; Hadleigh to Woolpit and Woodbridge."

Buy a copy of this or another of Paulineâ€™s books and get it signed. Mince pies and refreshments also available!
