Roll up, roll up!

As part of our regular Saturday Fun activities, we'll be entering the magical world of [<cite>The Butterfly Circus</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2561248). There'll be crafts and a trail, plus a chance to meet the author, Francesca Armour-Chelu!
