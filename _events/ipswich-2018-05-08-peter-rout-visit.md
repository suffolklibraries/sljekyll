Pete has spent a lifetime following Speedway. Over the last few years he has been lovingly crafting reproduction race jackets for the National Speedway Museum amongst others. You can see his collection at [http://www.classicracejackets.co.uk](http://www.classicracejackets.co.uk/).

Peter has an extensive collection of Speedway related memorabilia and even a vintage Speedway bike which he hopes to bring to the meeting.

Come along to listen to stories, view memorabilia and discuss memories!

Feel free to bring any Speedway Memorabilia of your own to share.
