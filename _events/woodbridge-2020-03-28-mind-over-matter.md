All are welcome to find out about the [Mind Over Matter Project](https://momproject.co.uk/).

The staff at the Mind Over Matter Project are experienced in the mental health field and take mental health very seriously. They are ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills) trained and understand and recognise the complications surrounding mental health. They offer one-to-one and group support and advice for those struggling, with each person being assessed on an individual basis depending on their own personal needs and unhealthy coping methods.

Their staff also support people having communication problems with authorities such as local councils and police. They work closely with authorities to make sure those suffering with mental health problems are not overlooked, and to prevent instances of injustice occurring. They additionally help rehabilitate people with criminal records.
