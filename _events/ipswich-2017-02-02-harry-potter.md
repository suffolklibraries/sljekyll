Join us at Ipswich County Library for a night at Hogwarts! Take part in a sorting ceremony, test your spell casting spells with Professor Hooch, take part in a potions class and choose a new subject with a new professor.

There will also be a treasure hunt, and Professor Snape will be hosting a magical quiz.

If you come dressed as a character youâ€™re in for a chance to win a prize!

Best suited for ages 5+ with all children accompanied by an adult (accompanying adult comes free). Buy your tickets at the library.
