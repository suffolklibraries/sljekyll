Join us at Ipswich County Library for a night at Hogwarts! Celebrate all things Harry Potter and take part in a potions class, hunt the fantastic beasts, and battle with spell casting. We will have a magical quiz and if you come dressed as a character youâ€™re in for a chance to win a prize!

Best suited for ages 5+ with all children accompanied by an adult (accompanying adult comes free). Buy your tickets at the library.
