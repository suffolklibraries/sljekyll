Hear author David E. Merrifield talk about his books, including [<cite>I've Got Your Number</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098171):

> "Meet Matt Briswell, loser and loner, trying to make the best of the rotten hand he's been dealt, picking up odd jobs on the fringes of the criminal underworld. With no job, no money and no girlfriend, Matt is reduced to eating dry cereal and stealing food from local shops. When you're at rock bottom, the only way is up, right?

> "One day, a chance encounter leads Matt to wonder whether his luck might be about to change. With the prospect of a job and even a new relationship, it seems that somebody is looking after Matt. Things are on the up until a hit and run threatens to destroy everything.

> "But sometimes blessings come in unlikely disguises. When Matt comes round, he finds he has an uncanny new ability. As he comes to realise just what he can do, he sees an opportunity to turn his life around. But will he turn in the right direction?"

You can also buy his books on the day and get them signed.
