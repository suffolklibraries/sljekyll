Celebrate and support your library service on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) with our magical afternoon. Not only do we have a performance from magician Jake Ace (commencing at 2:30pm), but you can enjoy a Harry Potter themed treasure hunt and Lego building.

Supported by the Friends of Brandon Library.
