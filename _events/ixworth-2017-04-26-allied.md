1942 in North Africa, a Canadian Intelligence Officer (played by Brad Pitt) encounters a female French Resistance fighter (Marion Cotillard) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. But when they are reunited in London their relationship is tested to the limit by the pressures of war.

This screening is part of Friends of Ixworth Library (FOIL)'s new series of community film nights at the Village Hall. All proceeds support Ixworth Library.

All help and volunteers most welcome. If you'd like to get involved in programming or promoting these events, or helping on the night, please call Debra on [01359 760326](tel:01359760326).
