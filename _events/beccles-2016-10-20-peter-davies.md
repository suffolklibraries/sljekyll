Spend an enjoyable hour or so listening to and commenting on poems about everyday life with Peter Davies. Poems that will strike a chord with old and young alike.

Poems about cats and computers; husbands and heaven; Norfolk and <cite>Neighbours</cite>; Suffolk and sacrilege; Christmas and chihuahuas; websites and Weightwatchers – and much more! Poems that are light-hearted and frivolous, some that are serious and sad; a lot that are funny-ha-ha and even a few that are funny-peculiar!

Peter Davies is a retired social worker and college lecturer, and has written many poems, short stories and articles published in various national and local magazines. Come along and share Peter’s love of poetry. No need to book. Just come along. Refreshments provided.
