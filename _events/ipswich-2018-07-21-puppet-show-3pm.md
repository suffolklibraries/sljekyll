Join us for the launch of the Summer Reading Challenge, and enjoy a puppet show! Dance along to music, watch the puppet show and help Captain Fun.

Afterwards, children will be able to sign up for the Summer Reading Challenge if they have a library card. No library card? Not to worry, just come and see us!

Tickets must be bought in advance from the library.
