We're proposing changing our opening hours so that the library opens earlier on most days, and closes earlier or later on some days, to better meet the needs of our customers.

We want to know what you think about the proposed changes, as well as your general thoughts on and use of the library. Please [take our short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/eyelibrary).
