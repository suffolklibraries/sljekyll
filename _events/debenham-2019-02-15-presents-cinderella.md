Join us in the school hall for a screening of Matthew Bourne's <cite>Cinderella</cite>. There will also be 'shorts' of local or historical interest, trailers for future screenings, and ice creams and a licensed bar available.

> "Matthew Bourne’s Cinderella is a thrilling and evocative love story set in London during the Second World War.

> "A chance meeting results in a magical night for Cinderella and her dashing young RAF pilot, together just long enough to fall in love before being parted by the horrors of the Blitz.

> "Matthew Bourne’s vivid storytelling has never been more heart-stopping and touching, and will take the audience into the heart of Prokofiev’s magnificent score."

Book in advance by contacting the library or at Websters Newsagents. Bring a cushion for comfort if needed. Car parking available.
