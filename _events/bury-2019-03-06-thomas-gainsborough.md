Thomas Gainsborough (1727â€“1788) was born in Sudbury, Suffolk to John and Mary Gainsborough, the youngest of nine children.

As a boy, Gainsborough displayed an early talent for drawing and painting, spending much of his childhood sketching in the woods and fields surrounding Sudbury. It was here that his love of landscape painting first developed, a passion that would go on to become an abiding feature of his artistic career.
