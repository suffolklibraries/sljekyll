Hear about Dimitri, the boy who tells everyone at nursery that he loves them, but worries that nobody loves him back, then make a menagerie of animals from heart shapes.

Jane Porter is an illustrator specialising in work both for and with children. She has worked with organisations including the National Trust, Historic Royal Palaces and the NHS. When she's not working, Jane is often to be found on the River Thames in a coracle or skiff, looking out for passing bars, cormorants and wagtails.
