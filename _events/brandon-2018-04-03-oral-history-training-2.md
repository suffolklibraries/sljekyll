The follow-up workshop to [Talkin' 'Bout My Generation: Free oral history training workshop 1 - Interviewing](/events/brandon-2018-03-17-oral-history-training-1/).

Talkinâ€™ 'Bout My Generation is a heritage project capturing teenage
musical memories from the 1960s, '70s and '80s in the Fens and Brecks. They are offering FREE Oral History Recording Training for up to 12 local residents interested in interviewing and recording the memories of residents, friends or relatives as part of this exciting pop-culture heritage project.

In this second workshop, using sample interviews recorded since workshop 1, Dr Shelley Lockwood will instruct the group in summarising the recording.

All participants will receive a certificate of attendance. As well as conducting personal interviews the trained volunteers will be invited to a series of local memory cafes to help gather the stories shared and be VIP guests at our Summer Celebratory Events.

Please bring your own headphone. Refreshments provided.
