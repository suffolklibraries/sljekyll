Suffolk Creative Photographic Group's exhibition at the library promises to be one of their best yet, with new images and a diverse mix of styles and subjects.

The Group was formed in early 2011 by a group of photographers whose aim is to be forward thinking and creative in photography, to help each other and to freely share their knowledge and skills. The group always enjoy exhibiting their images and receiving feedback from visitors.
