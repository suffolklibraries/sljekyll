We invite you to join us for a celebration of Felixstowe â€“ past, present and future.

Felixstowe-born author Hayley Long has steered Felixstowe.docs, a project which has culminated in a collection of writings by local young residents. Their work has been published in an anthology, dedicated to the town, and the students will showcase it at this event.

This event is free but booking is required. Refreshments provided.

This project is part of our [BLOC youth arts programme](/bloc/).
