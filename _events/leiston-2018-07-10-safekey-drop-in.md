Drop in to find out about and sign up with the Suffolk Safekey service.

For as little as Â£1 a month, with profits going to local charities, Suffolk Safekey gives you a branded key fob with a Constabulary crest and a unique identifying number so that if you lose your keys, they can be returned to you quickly and easily.
