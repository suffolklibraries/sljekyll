Get outdoors in our beautiful local surroundings this summer and help support Suffolk Libraries!

Your challenge is to walk or cycle any route between Aldeburgh, Leiston and/or Saxmundham libraries. You can register and start at any library, and do it in one day or over several. Register and pay at your starting library, collect your challenge passport, and have it stamped when you reach your destination library. We'll give you a map and all the details you need when you sign up.

Each library will be keeping track of their participants' miles. On [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) (Saturday 12 October), we'll announce which library clocked up the most miles and reward you with certificates and cake. Watch this space for more details of the award ceremonies!
