If your child attends any of our Sunday crafts sessions this December, they're invited to our Christmas party!

Join us for crafts, music and food and a visit from Father Christmas!

Please see a member of staff for a free numbered invitation, so we can let our special guest know how many presents to put in his sack.

Supported by the Friends of Long Melfold Library.
