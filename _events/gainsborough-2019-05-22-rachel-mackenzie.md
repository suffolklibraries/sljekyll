14-19 year-olds are invited to come along to our regular Box Fit session to meet World Thai Boxing champion Rachael MacKenzie. Rachael will be here to inspire you with her success and experiences of overcoming adversity.

Rachael started Thai Boxing in 2000 and topped the Women’s Thai Boxing world rankings in two weight categories (50kg and 52kg) in 2006. She has also taken two British titles – both by knockout – and a European title. She was the first European woman to compete in traditional bare-knuckle Thai Boxing in Thailand and the first woman to fight under Full Muay-Thai Rules in the UK.

Throughout her Thai Boxing career Rachael had to overcome prejudice from people who do not believe women should compete in contact sports. She has used her success to raise the profile of, and opportunities for, other female Thai Boxers.

Following a knee injury, Rachael recently made the switch from Thai Boxing to Boxing, taking silver at the National Championships in her first season and following that up to become National Champion.
