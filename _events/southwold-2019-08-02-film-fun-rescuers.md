**We're sorry that this event has been cancelled due to technical difficulties**

Children are invited to watch <cite>The Rescuers</cite> (1977), make a paper plate seagull, mouse puppet or pipe cleaner alligator, and munch on a sweetie tailed mouse, a fruity mouse or a cheesy mouse. Dare you try some edible bird poo?

Under 8s must be accompanied by an adult.
