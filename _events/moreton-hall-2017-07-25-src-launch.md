Children are invited to sign up to take part in the Summer Reading Challenge, and borrow their first library book.

The theme this year is Animal Agents. Horrid Henry illustrator Tony Ross has created a host of furry, slippery and feathered creatures who are ready to solve all kinds of crimes with their skills and natural instincts.
