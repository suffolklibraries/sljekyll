Dr Tim Howes will be talking about how the infamous 1827 Red Barn murder of Maria Marten in Polstead would be investigated today.

Tim qualified as a doctor at St Maryâ€™s Hospital in London in 1983. He trained as a respiratory physician and has recently retired from a post as consultant physician at Colchester Hospital. He has been involved in medical education and the management of all aspects of respiratory medicine.

In his spare time, Tim sails and races a boat with varying degrees of success. He also spends quite a lot of time taking apart perfectly good cars and putting them back together again badly (at least it feels like that!).

After Tim's talk, you're invited to our murder mystery evening with fish and chips. Decipher the clues, question the suspects and solve the crime before the other participants!
