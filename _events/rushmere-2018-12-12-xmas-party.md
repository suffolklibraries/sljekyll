The weekly Rushmere Library at Ransomes Pavilion has had over 1,000 visits and lent over 1,000 books to visitors since its launch in March 2018!

Help us to celebrate this milestone, and the festive period, at our Christmas party. There will be free mince pies and other refreshments along with festive songs and crafts.

The pre-school singing and stories session will be on as usual from 2:15-2:45pm.
