Follow Iestyn Edwards's journey through the warzones of Iraq and Afghanistan as his alter ego Madame Galina.

From being dressed down for drying his ballet tights on the anti-blast wall and trying to get his custard creams back from the President of Estonia to return them to the camels, to being lippy to Stacks, Royal Marine, and ending up on the turret of the Naughty Tank  - Iestyn will be sharing some side-splitting anecdotes as well as singing and dancing.

Ticket price includes a glass of wine or soft drink on arrival.
