Following the opening of Suffolkâ€™s newest library in Debenham, the Debenham Library Friends Group is celebrating the move by holding a special fundraising event this Sunday where the streets of the village will be lined with coins.

The group are asking local people to join in with their challenge of laying a trail of coins between the old library site at Cross Green, up to the new library, based at Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School half a mile up the road.

The idea is to link the two sites with donated coins, pennies and loose change with the money then being collected and used to fund further improvements and new equipment for the library. The event will also help to raise awareness of the new library.

The event is being held from 1pm on Sunday 10 July and everyone is welcome to join in, add their coins and follow the trail up to the new library to see the new facilities.

The new Debenham Library recently moved from its home in the resource centre in Cross Green to take up a larger space within Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School. The new library has more modern and flexible furniture with wheeled shelving to make holding activities easier. Being located at the school will make it easier for school pupils to engage with the library.
