Knowledgeable and humorous storyteller Dave Tonge will be telling stories and discussing his book <cite>Tudor Tales</cite>.

Dave Tonge has been telling tales since 1999. Prior to that he was a jack of all trades but, unhappy with the road he was traveling, decided to study for a BA and MA in English history and the first year of a PhD focusing on the relationships between Tudor men and women.

It was then that he discovered story telling and ran away to become an itinerant teller of tales!
