Everyone is invited to the launch of the [Lowestoft Library Sporting Memories reminiscence group](/events-activities/sporting-memories/).

Former England captain and Ipswich Town legend Terry Butcher will be at the library sharing memories from his career, including being part of the triumphant UEFA cup-winning team of 1981 and Town's flirtation with the league title in that era. Attendees are encouraged to bring along memorabilia or photographs and share their own memories.

The group will run every Thursday from 1030-1215. If you'd like to volunteer to help run the sessions, see [our Sporting Memories volunteering page](/events-activities/sporting-memories/volunteer-for-sporting-memories/).
