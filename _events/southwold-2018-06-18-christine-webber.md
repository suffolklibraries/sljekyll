Christine Webber is a former singer, Anglia TV presenter, agony aunt, columnist and Harley Street psychotherapist.

After a break of 29 years to write over a dozen non-fiction titles, Christine returned to writing fiction in 2016. The result was [<cite>Who'd Have Thought It?</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2049812) which is a romantic comedy novel about the change and challenges we encounter in mid-life. Her latest novel is [<cite>It's Who We Are</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2369318):

> "Do we feel better about our own challenges when the whole world seems to be in a state of chaos? That’s a question fifty-somethings Wendy, Philip, Michael, Julian and Araminta keep asking themselves as they deal with unprecedented upheaval - both to their existences, and the people they had believed themselves to be.

> "<cite>It’s Who We Are</cite> is a novel about kindness, friendship, family secrets and a medical mystery – and also about how vital it is to reach for what enhances rather than diminishes you.

Christine will be talking about her life and works and selling and signing copies of her new book.
