On retiring from the police, Paul worked for a High Court Judge at the Royal Courts of Justice (London). He is now the bestselling author of 35 non-fiction books but has now written a crime fiction trilogy beginning with <cite>Revenge of the Malakim</cite>.

As a media crime and police consultant and through working with authors, he is behind the creation of many well-known television detectives.
