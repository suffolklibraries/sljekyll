All ages are invited to join us for activities on [Suffolk Libraies Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/). Children can make crafts and take part in our Science Club, and we've got a literary treasure hunt for adults as well as a craft sale, displays from the Photographic Club and Art Group, a slideshow of the history of Kedington and tea and cake.
