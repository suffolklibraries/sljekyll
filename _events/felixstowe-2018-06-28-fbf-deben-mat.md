<cite>Life at the Deben</cite> is the story of a river that has its recorded origins in Roman times, moving on with the ebb and flow of the tide to transport the Viking invaders, the Saxon warriors of King Redwald and, for hundreds of years, the traders, fishermen and sailors who have brought prosperity and happiness to a region steeped in natural beauty.

This event is free of charge but you need a ticket to be admitted. There will be a voluntary collection in aid of the authors' chosen charity.
