Join Amnesty International at the library for some letter-writing to women around the world who have been harassed or imprisoned for standing up for human rights. Your messages of support will show these inspiring activists that you're on their side and help them keep fighting.

Find out more on the [Amnesty Internation UK website](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/write-for-rights).
