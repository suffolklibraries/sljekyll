In Laura Barnett's new novel, [<cite>Greatest Hits</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160814), fictional singer-songwriter Cass Wheeler puts together a Greatest Hits album. Through the tracks she chooses, we learn the story of her life - the highs and lows, the friendships and ambition, the loves and loss. She hasnâ€™t produced any new music for a decade so what prompted her to retreat, and is she now able to make her peace?

The book is described as a "bittersweet and poignant" follow-up to Laura's bestselling debut [<cite>The Versions of Us</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1867059) and is a gripping and innovative concept.

In conceiving this story, Laura has worked with the talented singer-songwriter Kathryn Williams - the songs in the book have all been produced as a companion CD.

Laura and Kathryn will be in conversation with Catherine Larner, talking about the novel and the songs and playing some of the music that was inspired by this story.
