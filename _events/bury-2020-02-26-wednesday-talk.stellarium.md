Richard will be giving attendees a tour of the night sky using the planetarium program <cite>Stellarium</cite>. This will include an exploration of the types of objects visible including naked eye objects, binocular objects and objects requiring a telescope. By the end of the talk you will have some understanding of why the number seven features so highly in the human psyche and why the human race is truly a race of time travellers!

Advance booking by contacting the library is advised.
