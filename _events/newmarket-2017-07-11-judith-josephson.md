Judith Josephson will be at the library talking about her book [<cite>Dear Heart: The Courting Letters</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2107395):

> "In 2010 teacher Lisa Anderson has almost given up on love after a failed, longtime relationship and internet dating disasters. In a cluttered attic, she discovers an antique writing box labeled "Courting Letters."

> "Untying the beribboned packets inside, she finds tattered envelopes, their contents penned more than a century before. As Lisa begins to read, she learns that in 1907 in Ipswich, England, the authors, Gertie and Fred, meet. Just as their friendship deepens into something more, Fred and his family emigrate to America in search of a better life.

> "Hopes for the budding relationship fade. Long months pass. Then a letter from Fred to Gertie arrives. The two begin a dance of written words, but the romance is fraught with obstacles, not the least of which is the Atlantic Ocean.

> "Separation and distance also conspire against Lisa when her intriguing new beau must return to his native Spain. <cite>Dear Heart: The Courting Letters</cite> weaves a tapestry from two intersecting love stories. Will the threads hold or pull apart?"
