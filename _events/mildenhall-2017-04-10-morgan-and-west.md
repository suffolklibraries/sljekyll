![Morgan and West](/images/featured/featured-morgan-west.jpg)

Time travelling Victorian magic duo Morgan & West unload another boxful of bafflement and impossibility. Witness a mountain of mysterious magic, a hatful of hyper-reality, and of course a truck full of tricks and tea. (Sadly there are no actual mountains or trucks on stage during the show, Mr West simply would not have them.)

Mixing brain-busting illusion and good old-fashioned tomfoolery, Morgan & West present a show for all the family, where magic and silliness abound!

There will be refreshments and a raffle.
