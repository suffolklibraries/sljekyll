Can you create a Fantastic Beast?

We would like you to design and make your own fantasy creature and tell us:

* What it eats

* Where it lives

* What magical powers it has

Please bring your Fantastic Beast along to the [Potter Party on 13 April](/events/lakenheath-2017-04-13-potter-party/) for the chance to win a copy of <cite>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</cite> on DVD.
