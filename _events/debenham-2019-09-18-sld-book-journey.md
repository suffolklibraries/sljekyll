As part of the [Suffolk Libraries Day Book Journey](/suffolk-libraries-day/book-journey/), Debenham Library friends Sue and Tony Hutt are taking the chosen book, [<cite>The Huntingfield Paintress</cite>, by Pamela Holmes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1955518), on its leg from Debenham to Stradbroke by tandem! Why not celebrate and support your local library by sponsoring them? Just drop in to the library.
