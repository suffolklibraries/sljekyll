We're holding an additional [Open Space](/health/open-space/) session as we're closed on Wednesdays 25 and 31 December. Come along for an informal and relaxed chat over refreshments and play some games if you like.

Our regular Open Space sessions are from 1pm-3pm on Wednesdays. [See the Newmarket Library Open Space timetable &rarr;](/health/open-space/newmarket/)
