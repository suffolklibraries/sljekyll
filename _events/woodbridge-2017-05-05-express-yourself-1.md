If you've ever wanted to live more creatively or find a way to express your creativity more easily, why not come along to this short course with Mia Philips on 'Creativity and the Three Principles'. We will explore where ideas come from, how to create effortlessly, what stops you from getting started and what to do if you get stuck.

Although there at three sessions that make up a short course, you can attend as many or as few of the sessions as you wish.

You can pay on the door, but please bear in mind that numbers are limited to keep the group small, supportive and allow plenty of time for discussion.
