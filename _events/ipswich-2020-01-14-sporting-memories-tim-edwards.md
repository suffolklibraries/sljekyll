Join us in our regular [Sporting Memories](/events-activities/sporting-memories/) session for a talk from Tim Edwards, co-founder of Ipswich Town Heritage Society, which celebrates and safeguards the club's heritage. Tim will be talking about the club's history from Shakespeare to the 1940s.

No need to book, just come along to the Lecture Hall on the first floor of the library.
