Young Adult book lovers are invited to talk about their favourite YA books and latest finds over refreshments. This month's book is [<cite>We Were Liars</cite>, by E. Lockhart](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1615611):

> "We are the Liars. We are beautiful, privileged and live a life of carefree luxury. We are cracked and broken. A story of love and romance. A tale of tragedy. Which are lies? Which is truth?"

Even if you haven't read the book, come along and find out what it's all about and whether you'd like to give it a go!
