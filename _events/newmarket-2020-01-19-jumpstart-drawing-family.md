Families are invited to join us for a relaxing wellbeing-themed drawing session with manga and comic artist Irina Richards. Why not take a look at [Irina's exhibition](/events/newmarket-2020-01-04-manga-exhibition/) while you're here?

This event is part of [Jumpstart January](/jumpstart-january/), a month dedicated to everything our libraries do to boost your wellbeing.
