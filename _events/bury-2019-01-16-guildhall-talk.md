Bury St Edmunds Guildhall has recently undergone a Â£2 million renovation project and has now reopened to the public. Dating back to 1279, it is the oldest continuously-used civic building in Britain.

Sandra Nicotera (learning & volunteering co-ordinator at the Guildhall) will be here to give a brief history of the Guildhall, what the Guildhall is today and the many ways people can enjoy this local gem.
