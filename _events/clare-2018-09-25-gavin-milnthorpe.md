Join us for an entertaining and informal morning with Gavin Milnthorpe, chatting about his books [<cite>Second Hand Scott</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2331637) and [<cite>Stanley Young is Planning a Murder</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1469629), telling stories and maybe even sharing a song or two.
