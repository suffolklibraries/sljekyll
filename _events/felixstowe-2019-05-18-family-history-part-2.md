Did you attend our [introduction to family history on 4 May](/events/felixstowe-2019-05-04-family-history)? Or do you wish you'd been there?

Mike will be at the library again, recapping some of what was covered in the first session for beginners, and sharing new information about this fascinating pastime for those who'd like some further help getting started.

This is free event, but please contact the library to book your place in advance.
