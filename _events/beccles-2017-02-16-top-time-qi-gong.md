This is a low level exercise session of mindful movement.

Come along and participate in a beginners' class as an active introduction to Qi Gong. Feel the benefit from the experience, as your body feels what Qi Gong is like. Spend a very positive hour doing something great for yourselves.

Sarah will explain about Qi Gong and the movements during the session.

Refreshments available. Please wear loose clothing.
