George Orwell first came to live in Southwold in 1921, beginning an association with the town which lasted more than twenty years.

Ronald Binnsâ€™ new book provides the first full, authoritative account of Orwell's connection with Southwold, its people and the books which he wrote while living there.

Ronald will be signing copies of his book after the talk.
