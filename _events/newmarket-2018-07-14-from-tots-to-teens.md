Authors Gillian McClue, Pippa Goodhart and Rosemary Hayes will be at the library for a panel discussion and question and answer session. Find out why children's literature is so important, and how you can engage young readers' interest. 

Parents, grandparents, teachers and writers are particularly encouraged to come along and find out how to choose the best books for children and cultivate a love of books and reading.

The authors will also be selling and signing their children's books and displaying their artwork.
