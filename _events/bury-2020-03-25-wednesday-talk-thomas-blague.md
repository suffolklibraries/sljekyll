Colonel Thomas Blague of Horringer was the archetypal Cavalier. During the first Civil War, while serving as the royalist governor of Wallingford, he acquired a fearful reputation as a ferocious and ruthless swordsman. His 'courage and devotion' to the royalist cause proved so strong that he did not lay down his arms until July 1646.

Even then he refused to accept defeat and immersed himself in a succession of royalist plots to restore first Charles I and then Charles II to power. He was the informing genius of the May-pole Riot in Bury St Edmunds in May 1648 and the Norfolk Insurrection in December 1650.

This lecture will explore Blague's colourful career, including his unexpected disgrace at the Battle of the Sand Dunes outside Dunkirk on 14 June 1658.

Advance booking by contacting the library is advised.
