Children aged 2-5, their teddies, and their parents/carers are invited to our monthly interactive story time. Hear [<cite>Where's My Teddy?</cite>, by Jez Alborough](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2152009) and enjoy a sing-a-long, games, crafts and food. Come prepared to get messy!
