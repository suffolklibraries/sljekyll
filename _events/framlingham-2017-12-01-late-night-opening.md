Extended opening for late night shopping in Framlingham.

At 6pm we will have a Christmas story time for children. There will also be a treasure hunt.

There will also be a Fairtrade stall and Fairtrade mulled wine, juice, mince pies, cake and chocolates available courtesy of the Friends of Framlingham Library.
