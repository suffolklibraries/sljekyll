Newmarket Library manager Kate Ashton is running the Oxford Half Marathon on Sunday 13 October to raise funds for [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/). If you'd like to sponsor her, you can do so through [our Golden Giving page](https://www.goldengiving.com/fundraising/SLDHalfMarathon).

Any support is very much appreciated and will help our libraries do even more for their local communities.
