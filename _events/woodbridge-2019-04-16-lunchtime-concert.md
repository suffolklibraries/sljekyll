Jetsam, the Woodbridge Cruising Club ukulele band, have been playing together for eighteen months. Their speciality is playing and singing songs from the 60s and 70s with a smattering of earlier ones for people to sing along to. They made their debut performance at Maritime Woodbridge last September.
