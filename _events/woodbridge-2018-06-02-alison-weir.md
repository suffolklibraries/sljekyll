Acclaimed author and historian Alison Weir will be giving an illustrated talk on her new novel, [<cite>Jane Seymour: The Haunted Queen</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2361867).

This third novel in Alison's epic Six Tudor Queens series casts a fresh light on both traditional and modern perceptions of Henry VIII's tragic third wife. A young woman of courage and compassion, come from a family tainted by scandal, Jane was driven by the strength of her faith and a belief that she might do some good in a wicked world. All would be well if she could give the King what he wants.

It will be available on the night at a special discounted price, as well some of Alison's other books. She will be signing copies after the talk.

Ticket price includes refreshments and a surprise. Tickets are transferable but not refundable. Tickets are available from Woodbridge Emporium at 66 Thoroughfare, Woodbridge, IP12 1AL, on [01394 382382](tel:01394382382) or by emailing **woodbridgeemporium@gmail.com**
