A fantasy/science-fiction/contemporary fiction novel which has been described as speculative/modern in genre, <cite>I've Got Your Number</cite> is set in East London in around 2011. Everything is quite normal except that there are angelic type beings who can look down on the Earth and have the power to influence some events. They pick the main character as someone who is in need of a helping hand and decide to give him a special power to boost his luck.

Come and meet David, chat to him about his book and get a copy personally signed by him!
