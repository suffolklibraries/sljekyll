Join us for a talk from author Peter Holland about his book, <cite>Barbary Slave</cite>:

> "A historical fiction set in 1631, and the wider historical context. Barbary Corsairs from north African centres like Algiers and Tunis raided European shipping and towns for hundreds of years, a story of which there is not a wide awareness here in England. Scholars estimate the numbers to be more than one million in the 300 years from 1500 to 1800. The novel focuses on another true event, the raid on Baltimore in Ireland, in which more than 100 were taken to Algiers and sold into slavery. The demand for Christian slaves came from the Ottoman Empire."
