Get Connected is a chance for local people to get expert help and information on the free eBooks, eAudio books, eMagazines, and music  downloads available from Suffolk Libraries.

With the support of the Friends of Southwold Library, the library is also launching a new service lending iPads.

The event will also be an ideal opportunity to try out a device or bring your own device to get advice on using it to access Suffolk’s extensive eLibrary services using the library’s free customer Wi-Fi.
