Community First Responders are volunteers who are trained to attend certain types of emergency calls in the area where they live or work. Their aim is to reach a potential life threatening emergency in the first vital minutes before the ambulance crew arrives.

Over 55s are invited to find out more about the First Responders' work at this interesting talk.
