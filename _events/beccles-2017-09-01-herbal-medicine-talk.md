Herbal medicine is part of our cultural heritage, an ancient science and the root of all modern medicine. For many people it is an important part of healing today, and offers a holistic approach to healing in a time when healthcare can seem impersonal, hurried and pressured.

Nathalie tackles the important question of the place of herbal medicine in the 21st century with knowledge from 20 years of experience in the field.

Nathalie began studying herbalism at the age of 19, taking evening classes with the well-respected herbalist Christopher Hedly. A trip to India in her early 20s confirmed that this was the path she needed to take: "in the foothills of the Himalayas in a village called Dharamkot, perched on the hillside above Dharamsala (the site of the official residence-in-exile of the Dalai Lama), I met a herbalist who directed me to the new BSc course at Middlesex University, a moment of serendipity which changed my life forever."

She went on to gain a BSc in Herbal Medicine and has worked in the field ever since.

There will be wine and nibbles available and a chance to ask questions.

All finds raised will go to the library.
