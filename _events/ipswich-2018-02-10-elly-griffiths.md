We're afraid this event has now **sold out**. However, you can still see Elly at [Southwold Library on Saturday 10 February](/events/southwold-2018-02-10-elly-griffiths/) and [Woodbridge Library on Saturday 17 February](/events/woodbridge-2018-02-17-elly-griffiths/).

Award-winning crime writer Elly Griffiths will be at the library talking about her new book, [<cite>The Dark Angel</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317358), the 10th Dr Ruth Galloway mystery.

Elly will be signing copies of her books, with books available to buy on the day.

Ticket price includes refreshments and nibbles.

Tickets available online and from the ground floor enquiry desk.
