Drop in to the library for free coffee and mince pies. Meet others and have a chat in a relaxed environment.

We'll also be drawing our raffle at 11:30am! Buy tickets for Â£1 next time you're in the library, or on the day, and find out if you're the winner of a food hamper (1st prize), fruit hamper (2nd prize) or one of our other prizes.
