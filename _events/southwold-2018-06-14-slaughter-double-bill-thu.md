Join us for a classic crime double bill as part of the Slaughter in Southwold crime writers' festival.

<img src="/images/featured/featured-strangers-on-a-train-dial-m-for-murder.jpg" alt="Strangers on a Train and Dial M for Murder" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

In <cite>Strangers on a Train</cite>, a psychotic socialite confronts a pro tennis star with a theory on how two complete strangers can get away with murder - a theory that he plans to implement. Starring Farley Granger, Robert Walker & Ruth Roman.

In <cite>Dial M for Murder</cite>, an ex-tennis pro carries out a plot to murder his wife. When things go wrong, he improvises a brilliant plan B. Starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings.

This event is not included in Slaughter in Southwold day or weekend passes.
