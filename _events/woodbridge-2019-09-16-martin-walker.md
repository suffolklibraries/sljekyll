Join us for a lunchtime talk with journalist, novelist, cookery writer and wine lover Martin Walker. On a rare return to the UK, Martin will be discussing his new book, [<cite>The Body in the Castle Well</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2558181), starring village policeman, gourmet cook and former soldier Bruno:

> "A rich American art student is found dead at the bottom of a well in an ancient hilltop castle. The young woman, Claudia, had been working in the archives of an eminent French art historian, a crippled Resistance war hero, at his art-filled chateau. As Claudia's White House connections get the US Embassy and the FBI involved, Bruno traces the people and events that led to her fatal accident - or was it murder.

> "Bruno learns that Claudia had been trying to buy the chateau and art collection of her tutor, even while her researches led her to suspect that some of his attributions may have been forged. This takes Bruno down a trail that leads him from the ruins of Berlin in 1945, to France's colonial war in Algeria. The long arm of French history has reached out to find a new victim, but can Bruno identify the killer - and prove his case?"

The book is published in June, so when you buy your ticket you will receive <cite>The Body in the Castle Well</cite> to read ahead of meeting Martin in September.
