Drop in and meet Wendy from informal mental health advocacy group Suffolk User Forum for refreshments and a chat.

[Suffolk User Forum](https://www.suffolkuserforum.co.uk) (SUF) is an independent service user led charity based in Suffolk, helping to support people with mental health issues to have their voices heard.

SUF will be visiting libraries across Suffolk where you will be able to have a chat about any concerns you may have around mental health, whether for yourself, as a family carer, or as a friend/relative of a person who has a mental health illness.

SUF will also be very happy to record any feedback you have regarding your or a loved one's experience of the mental health system in Suffolk. This will be done anonymously and enable SUF to feed back to commissioners to show what is working well and not so well, there for being a catalyst for change in the future.
