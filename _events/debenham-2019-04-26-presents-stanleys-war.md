> "Stories of love, loss and sacrifice, following the lives of Suffolk people during World War I.

> "Directed by Tim Curtis (<cite>Life on the Deben</cite>), this compelling drama-documentary film is based on true stories from Suffolk's First World War. It recounts the true life-changing experiences at the Western Front of Stanley Banyard, a farm hand from Ramsholt, and how he saved the lives of his comrades, lost in no-man's land, using skills learned as a boy from a Suffolk gamekeeper."

Book in advance by contacting the library or at Websters Newsagents. Bring a cushion for comfort if needed. Car parking available.
