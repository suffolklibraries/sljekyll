Schrödinger's Clock® is the latest addition to the clock collection in Moyse's Hall. It is unique in that it lets you play with time by sometimes deliberately telling the WRONG time, with the aim of helping you reflect on something we take for granted in the world around us.

In this light-hearted talk, inventor Antony Hurden will be telling the story behind this clock, which draws its inspiration from the works of Lewis Carroll, Salvador Dali, and Albert Einstein. There will also be the chance to see another unusual clock he has created.
