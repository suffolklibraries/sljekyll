Ickworth House was designed to be both a home for the Hervey family and a publicly accessible art gallery. However, the plan for an art gallery was thwarted by the French Revolution.

As well as explaining how the present collection came to be, Graham will discuss the international significance of the art treasures located at Ickworth, such as paintings by Titian, Velazquez, Hogarth and Gainsborough, and sculptures by Flaxman and Nollekens.
