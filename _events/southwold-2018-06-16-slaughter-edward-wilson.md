Edward Wilson will be talking about his spy novels, set in the Cold War and featuring rather reluctant MI6 officer Catesby. Suffolk is at the core of these novels; Catesby hails from the county, and returns there at times of trouble.

Edward Wilson is a native of Baltimore and served as a Special Forces officer in Vietnam. After leaving the army, Wilson became a British citizen and has made his home in Suffolk since 1976. He was a lecturer at Lowestoft College for 21 years and continued to teach in Suffolk schools while becoming a full-time writer.

Edward's latest novel is [<cite>A Very British Ending</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1934079). As well as six novels, he has written as a commentator and reviewer for <cite>The Independent</cite>, <cite>Tribune Magazine</cite>, <cite>The Guardian</cite> and <cite>Open Democracy</cite>.

There will be an opportunity to buy Edward's books from Beccles Books and have them signed after the talk.
