> "Peter Grimes is a fisherman, living in a small Suffolk town. He is summoned to court after the death of his young apprentice at sea; the townspeople are convinced Grimes is to blame, but he is let off with a caution and warned not to take another apprentice. Some time later the boy falls to his death; the townspeople gather to hunt Grimes down, despite desperate pleas for mercy from school mistress Ellen Orford who cares for him."

> "Grimes descends into madness as the old sea captain Balstrode tells him to sail his ship out to sea and drown himself."
