Gavin Extence is the author of three stunning novels which are simultaneously funny and compelling as well as thought-provoking and challenging. He tackles potentially difficult and sometimes troubling subjects with a lightness and warmth, wit and humour.

In his debut novel <cite>The Universe Versus Alex Woods</cite>, we meet a teenage science nerd called Alex as he befriends a Vietnam veteran. In a freak accident as a child, Alex was struck by a meteorite. Though he survived, he was forever changed by the experience and develops severe epilepsy.

Next came <cite>The Mirror World of Melody Black</cite>, the story of a young woman carving out a career in journalism. Something sets her apart from everyone else, and it becomes clear this is the thing that could destroy her. It’s a clever, funny and poignant account of what it’s like to live with bipolar disorder.

Now with <cite>The Empathy Problem</cite> released this summer, Gavin turns to the financial community. A millionaire banker is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. In denial, he continues with business as usual but gradually notes the changes in his character. He is becoming less selfish, less mercenary and more compassionate of others. When he comes to care for a young woman busking on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, he wonders if there is time for second chances.

Gavin’s novels have won prizes, been featured on the Simon Mayo BBC Radio Two Book Club, and the Richard &amp; Judy Summer Book Club Read, and have sold in 21 countries.

Gavin is a rising star and this event is not to be missed!
