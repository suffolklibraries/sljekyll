Are you aged 7 - 17? Do you want to learn how to build a website or create an app or game? Come along to start your programming journey at our CoderDojo, an informal, creative and social environment.

Bring your own laptop if you can - we will have a limited number available on the day for those who don't have their own to use.

Under 12s must by accompanied by an adult.

Visit the [CoderDojo website](https://coderdojo.com/) for more information.

This event is supported by [IJYI](https://www.ijyi.com/).
