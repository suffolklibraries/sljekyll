> "Exuberant, flamboyant and fantastical, director Dexter Fletcher (also Bohemian Rhapsody) creates a dazzling rock opera recounting Elton John’s rise from a small boy to a worldwide star. Sensitively exploring childhood trauma and his conflicted issues of sexuality, the film delves into Elton’s back catalogue with relish. Taron Egerton is fantastic in the lead role."
