Local wine expert Bob Stopp will be guiding us through a selection of eight wines from the tip of the African continent. We will also sample some food from the region, with a barbecue outside if the weather permits.

There will also be a raffle.

Tickets available from the library. All proceeds to Elmswell Library Friends.
