[NessFest](https://www.facebook.com/NessFestLowestoft/) is back for a second year!

Whether you are just starting out or already a keen photographer, you're invited to this fun-filled, practical SLR photography workshop. The sessions will introduce key skills to develop your photography, take you on a photography walking tour and review the images taken.

SLR cameras and equipment will be provided, wear suitable walking shoes.

This workshop is limited to 10 people, so arrive at the **main information point in the library foyer** early to avoid disappointment.
