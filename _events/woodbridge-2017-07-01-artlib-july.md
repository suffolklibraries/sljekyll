Anthony spent 45 years as a commercial interior designer working all over the world. Having relocated to Suffolk in 2000, Anthonyâ€™s past interest in photography and painting was reawakened.

Having now fully retired, and after a very informative and challenging four years membership of the Ipswich and District Photographic Society, Anthony now has a wider appreciation for the natural delights and unique features of Suffolk, especially the nautical wrecks along the wonderful waterways of the Suffolk coastal regions.

Following his display of paintings last month, Anthony returns this month to display his photographic images of nautical subjects which have been printed on canvas.
