Textile Art Group Suffolk (TAGS) was formed in 1993. Members include embroiderers, spinners, weavers, papermakers and quilters, although many of the artists have other specialities. The mixture of skills within the group provides a broad, lively environment in which to work.

TAGS holds an annual exhibition at The Pond Gallery, Snape Maltings and takes up other exhibiting opportunities all over the county.
