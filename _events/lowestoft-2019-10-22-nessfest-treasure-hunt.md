[NessFest](https://www.facebook.com/NessFestLowestoft/) is back for a second year!

Teams of 4-6 are invited to solve a puzzle to win a prize.

Travel back in time to WWII and find the clues around the archive and library. Along the way you'll encounter local characters who will tell you what it was like to live in Lowestoft during the Second World War - listen carefully as they will help you find what you're looking for. Be prepared for a bombing raid but keep calm and carry on!
