Meet author Pauline Manders, who will be selling and signing copies of her new book <cite>Utterly Roasted</cite>:

> 'It is August 2013 and Chrissie Jax and D.I. Clive Merry return to Suffolk from a short break in Amsterdam. Within a week, two bodies are delivered to the morgue and the international spotlight is on Clive and his investigation.

> "Tension mounts as a tangled web of car paint re-spraying, a catering outfit, pike fishing and chocolate draws in long term friends Matt and Nick. Chrissie becomes part of the investigation in a way no one could have predicted.

> "The action moves from Alton Water to Ipswich; Bury St Edmunds to Felixstowe; Hadleigh to Woolpit and Woodbridge.

> "This is the eighth novel in the Utterly crime series. It stands alone, but we see the return of many characters met before.'

There will be free festive refreshments.
