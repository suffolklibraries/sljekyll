Richard will give a brief history of how an astronomical observatory came to be situated on the Athenaeum building. He will also provide an outline of the plans for restoration and for its subsequent use, an illustrated tour of the observatory, and an update on the progress made so far.
This will be followed by some information about the Athenaeum Astronomical Association, which was set up as part of the restoration plan.

Advance booking by contacting the library is advised.
