> "<cite>Before Spring Came Summer</cite> is an historical drama based on true events. Set during the seventeenth century against a backdrop of civil and domestic unrest, Jane Whorwood, 1612-1684, tells her story.

> "At the age of five years, after the unexpected death of her father, William Ryder, circumstances lead her to the inner sanctum of the future King Charles I's royal court, where a path for an extraordinary life is at once determined.

> "In a society that limited the boundaries of women in favour of decisions made by men of power, we follow the twist and turns of Jane Whorwood's life, consumed by deceit, destruction, death and a profound desire for justice."
