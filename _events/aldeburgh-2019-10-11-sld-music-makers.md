Under-5s and their parents/carers are invited to join our older people from our Friendship Fridays group for a special [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) Mini Music Makers with the Britten-Pears Foundation. Make some music together and have fun at this simple, low-key session.

Places are limited, so contact the library to book.
