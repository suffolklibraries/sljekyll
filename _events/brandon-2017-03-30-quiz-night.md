As it's spring time, why not give those little grey cells a polish up and join us for a fun quiz evening in the library?

Beverages and cake available, bring your own wine and nibbles. There will be a raffle at half time and prizes for the highest and lowest scoring teams.

Teams of up to 4 people. Tables must be booked in advance either at the library desk or by phoning [01842 816106](tel:01842816106).
