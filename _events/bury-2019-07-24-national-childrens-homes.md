Join us for a talk on the work done by National Children's Homes from the late nineteenth to early twenty-first centuries.

> "It might surprise some people, the efforts some children were put through in the early days, but their achievements must be marvelled at, as well as their "carers" and labour masters' efforts.

> "Although most children's homes have closed, the work of children's care is carried on by Action for Children, in a slightly different role."
