Join us for some wellbeing and mindfulness activities designed to boost your mood. We've got adult colouring, jigsaws, board games and children's crafts, as well as a wide range of health and mood-boosting books, audiobooks and music to borrow.

You can also have a go at [Pilates](/events/bury-2019-01-27-pilates/) or borrow some of our [Move It equipment](/news/move-it/).
