Anne Rea is a professional artist and illustrator living and working on the Suffolk coast. Always fascinated by coastlines and estuaries, she spends days by the water producing initial sketches on which to base the final paintings which are produced using a variety of media including watercolour, acrylics, oil and pastel. She particularly looks for tone and colour that can be simplified in a dramatic way, especially with powerful skies.

This exhibition will feature a selection of recent paintings and etchings of landscape around the Deben Estuary.
