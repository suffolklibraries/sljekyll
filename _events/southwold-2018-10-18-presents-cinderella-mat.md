> "Matthew Bourne’s Cinderella is a thrilling and evocative love story set in London during the Second World War.

> "A chance meeting results in a magical night for Cinderella and her dashing young RAF pilot, together just long enough to fall in love before being parted by the horrors of the Blitz.

> "Matthew Bourne’s vivid storytelling has never been more heart-stopping and touching, and will take the audience into the heart of Prokofiev’s magnificent score."
