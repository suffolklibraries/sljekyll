National children's literacy charity Beanstalk are expanding into Suffolk. This launch event includes great readings from children's author Lisa Thompson, guest speakers and local primary school children.

Would you like to volunteer with 3-4 year-olds, introducing them to the wonders of reading? This is your chance to chat to someone from Beanstalk to find out more and get involved.
