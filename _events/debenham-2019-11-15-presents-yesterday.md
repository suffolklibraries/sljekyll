Filmed in Ramsholt, Gorleston, Lowestoft, Clacton and elsewhere, Danny Boyle joins celebrated screenwriter Richard Curtis for a new comedy starring Lily James, Himesh Patel and Kate McKinnon.

> "Sick of getting small-time gigs and unable to get his performing career off the ground, musician Jack (Himesh Patel) is about to give it all up when a mysterious cycling accident changes everything. When he comes around and recovers from his head injury, he plays a song by The Beatles for his friends, only to discover that they have never heard of The Beatles and believe that the tune is an original song written by Jack. He begins to use this strange turn of events to his advantage, but when his increasing fame starts to get out of hand Jack starts to question what matters most in life."
