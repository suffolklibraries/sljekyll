Learn how to get online safely, create an email address, safely use online banking, dos and don'ts of the internet, and how to use price comparison services to reduce your energy bills on this one-day workshop.

You will need to bring your own digital device (iPad, tablet or laptop) if possible - please let us know when booking if you need to use one of our devices, as only a limited number are available. Please also bring a recent utilities bill to practice with price comparison sites.

There will also be the opportunity to win an iPad.

Call Chris on [07733 301876](tel:07733301876) to book.
