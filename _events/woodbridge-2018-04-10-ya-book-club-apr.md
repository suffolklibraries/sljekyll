Young book-lovers are invited to Woodbridge's Young Adult book club: a group run by young people, for young people.

As well as the hottest new releases and our favourite authors, we will be talking about [<cite>Am I Normal Yet?</cite>, by Holly Bourne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1791948):

> "Evie, Amber and Lottie: three girls facing down tough issues with the combined powers of friendship, feminism and cheesy snacks. Both hilarious and heart-rending, this is Evie's no-holds-barred story of struggling to live a 'normal' teen life in the grip of OCD."

You don't have to have read the whole book - just come along and join the discussion. Refreshments will be provided!
