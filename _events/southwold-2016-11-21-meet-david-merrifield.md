Author David E. Merrifield will be talking about his third novel <cite>I've Got Your Number</cite>, a speculative, slightly science-fiction novel set in east London about a young man down on his luck who is given a special power; but does he use it properly?

Merrifield will also be talking about his experiences of taking up up full time writing late in life after coming 2nd in a national Civil Service short story competition in 2010.
