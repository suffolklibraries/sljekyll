Rebecca Tope is the author of over 30 crime novels, set in various parts of the English countryside. The two main series are the Cotswolds series featuring Thea Osborne/Slocombe, house-sitter, and the Lake District series featuring Simmy Brown, florist. Both are amateur and often reluctant detectives.
