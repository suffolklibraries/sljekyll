Children and their parents/carers are invited to meet the star of <cite>Worzel goes for a walk! Will you come too?</cite> and his assistant, Catherine Pickles. Listen to the lovely story and learn responsible dog walking for children.

This beautifully illustrated book tells the story of a child and a dog going for a walk, told from the dog’s point of view in an easy-reading rhythmical style. As explained by Worzel, an enormous lurcher with ‘issues,’ new experiences can be very scary for him, although he really, really does want to go on exciting walks.

Please **no other dogs** at this event.
