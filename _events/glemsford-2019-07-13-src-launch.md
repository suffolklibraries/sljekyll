We're blasting off the 2019 [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) with a very special free event for all the family. Become an astronaut using the latest VR technology! Blast off into space, pilot your research vessel around planets and moons and learn about the solar system. Maybe you'll be inspired to become a scientist or astronaut for real one day?

There are three VR sessions:

* 2pm - 2:50pm
* 3pm - 3:50pm
* 4pm - 4:50pm

Each session is first come, first served, but if you miss a slot, you can still enjoy space-themed activities, crafts, fun and treats, as well as sign up for the challenge.
