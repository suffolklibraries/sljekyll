Enjoy a collection of archive films narrated by Bernard Hill and Julie Hewitt.

This collection has been produced by Creative Arts East as part of the BFI’s Britain on Film project, revealing hidden histories and forgotten stories of people and places across Norfolk and Suffolk, from the UK’s film and TV archives.

The fish & chip lunch is at 12.45pm and must be booked in advance.
