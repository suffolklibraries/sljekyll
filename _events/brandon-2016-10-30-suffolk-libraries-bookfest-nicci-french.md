**Nicci French is the pseudonym for husband and wife thriller writers Nicci Gerard and Sean French. They have published 14 bestselling novels before embarking on their current series, set around the life of psychotherapist, Frieda Klein. Their books have been described as “sophisticated, compassionate and gripping” by fellow thriller writer, Sophie Hannah.**

Nicci and Sean will talk to us about their long success in thriller writing, and speculate on the recent rise in profile of the genre,
particularly with the female audience.

The latest Nicci French novel, and the sixth in the series featuring Frieda Klein was published earlier this year. <cite>Saturday Requiem</cite> features Hannah Doherty, arrested 13 years previously, at the age of 18, for the brutal murder of her family. She has been incarcerated in a secure hospital ever since. Frieda is asked to give an assessment of Hannah and discovers that she is just as much a victim as her family. Something wasn’t right all those years ago.

Nicci and Sean will talk to us about finding ideas for their novels, whether they are troubled by the subject matter of their books and the
challenges and pleasures of writing a series of books, rather than a standalone novel.

They will also reveal the secrets of working together! Living in a village in Suffolk, Sean takes to the garden shed and Nicci is in the
attic during their working day. So how do they collaborate on each book? Are there arguments? When do they write alone and when do they
collaborate? Can we tell who wrote what?!

Come along to find out more about this fascinating, warm and generous couple.
