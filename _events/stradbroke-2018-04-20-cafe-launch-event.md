Join us for the launch of our new monthly Friday Friends Café for people affected by dementia. People with memory loss and their carers are invited to meet, relax and socialise over tea and cake. Support and advice will also be available.

For more information, contact the library or Vicky Hutchinson on [07841 460379](tel:07841460379).

Supported by Stradbroke Court House Café, Stradbroke Parish Council, Suffolk County Council, Suffolk Libraries, Julie Flatman (MSDC) and Age UK Suffolk.
