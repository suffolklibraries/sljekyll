11-18 year-olds are invited to make their very own horror movie while learning all the key elements of film-making at Thurston Library. Your film will then be screened at our special Halloween horror film screening on Thursday 31 October - more details about that coming soon!

This project is free and refreshments will be provided.

**This project runs across five dates: 28 September and 5, 12, 19 & 26 October**. Participants must be able to attend all five workshops.

We only have spaces for 20 people, so sign-up is on a first come, first served basis. Email **arts@suffolklibraries.co.uk** or text/call [07516 323532](tel:07516323532) to book your place.
