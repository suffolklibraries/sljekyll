**<cite>Blackwater</cite> is the first in a new police thriller series set in Essex in the 1980s. It’s based around the coast and the estuary, and features the dysfunctional lives of the police officers contending with smugglers, dealers and the criminal underworld. There is also a strong rivalry with the military stationed in the barracks in the town. It’s a great read, and very atmospheric.**

James will be talking to us about this book, and also how he has written prequels to the DI Frost novels of RD Wingfield. Writing under a pseudonym, James still keeps his day job as a publisher, so there’s a great deal to discuss. Come and meet him to find out more!
