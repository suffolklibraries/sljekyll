'Together We Can Conquer Stroke' gives you the information you need to speak confidently about stroke, and why it's important to keep stroke a priority.

It includes key facts about the impact of stroke, stroke research, care and support. It can help you to talk about the stroke issues that matter to you.

There will also be a [Stroke Association display](/events/bury-2019-05-20-stroke-association/) at the library with lots of information about the work the charity does.
