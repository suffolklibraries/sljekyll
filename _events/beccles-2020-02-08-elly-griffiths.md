Join us for an evening with Elly Griffiths, author of the best-selling Dr Ruth Galloway and Stephens and Mephisto series. The CWA Dagger in the Library winner will be talking about her new Dr Ruth Galloway novel, [<cite>The Lantern Men</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2687390) and her books more generally, taking questions and signing copies of her books.

Wine and soft drinks will be available to purchase on the night.

We strongly advise [booking in advance online](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/an-evening-with-elly-griffiths-tickets-83773987251) or by contacting the library as Elly's events are always very popular!
