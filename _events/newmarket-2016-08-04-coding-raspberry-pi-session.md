Suffolk Libraries' very own Literacy Ambassador, Matt Shenton, will be in the library offering coding sessions with Raspberry Pi and Kano kits and helping 11-16 year olds complete the [ImagiNation](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/events-activities/summer-reading-challenge/imagination/) scheme.

Fan of Star Wars? Our very own BB8 droid will be in attendance.
