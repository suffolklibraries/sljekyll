Join us at our regular Sporting Memories reminiscence session for over-50s with special guest speaker Terry Hunt.

Terry is the former editor of the <cite>East Anglian Daily Times</cite> and <cite>Ipswich Star</cite>, and is a current North Stander. He will share his passion for all things Ipswich Town with personal reminiscences, anecdotes and behind the scenes stories covering the glorious and not-so-glorious years at Portman Road.

You are encouraged to bring your own football memorabilia and share your own memories.

The event will be taking place in our 1st floor Lecture Hall. Sporting Memories meets weekly and includes chats, games and activities.
