Hear Josephine Reynolds talk about her book [<cite>Fire Woman</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138464). There will be copies on sale that you can get signed after the talk.

> "When Josephine Reynolds signed up with the Norfolk Fire Service in July 1982 at just seventeen years old, there was no such thing as a firefighter - only fire men. Set against the slate-grey backdrop of early 1980s Britain, <cite>Fire Woman</cite> is the story of how a young woman brought up in rural Wales coped in the testosterone-fuelled world of the fire brigade, where even today 96 percent of all staff are male.

> "In a life packed with incident - where lethal forest fires, escaped zoo animals and unexploded bombs formed a background to the everyday toll of death and disaster - Josephine experienced both triumph and heartbreaking personal tragedy. <cite>Fire Woman</cite> also provides a unique insight into the camaraderie that comes with risking your life on a daily basis and stands as the inspiring true story of an extraordinary young woman who took on a man's world and won, becoming Britain's first female firefighter."
