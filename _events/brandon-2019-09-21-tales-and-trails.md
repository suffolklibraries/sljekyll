Join us at the [Tales and Trails festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/brandon-country-park/tales-and-trails-festival/1110626802470447/)! We will be running a 'myths and legends' trail with storytelling, poetry and song, while the Friends of Brandon Library are sponsoring a child-friendly creative writing workshop as well as a performer on the lawns.

Why not also check out the exhibition up at the Engine House, involving the library's creative writing and poetry groups?
