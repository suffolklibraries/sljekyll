Join best-selling childrenâ€™s author Peter Bunzl as he reveals how his love of fantastical film-robots and Victorian mystery stories inspired his steampunk series The Cogheart Adventures.

Discover how to create your own flip-animation featuring a jumping robot and learn how to draw an animated strip for a Victorian zoetrope.

Recommended for ages 7+. Accompanying adults do not require a ticket unless participating in the workshop.
