Join us for a classic crime double bill as part of the Slaughter in Southwold crime writers' festival.

<cite>Touch of Evil</cite> is a stark, perverse story of murder, kidnapping and police corruption in a Mexican border town, starring Charlton Heston, Orson Welles & Janet Leigh.

In <cite>The Third Man</cite>, pulp novelist Holly Martins travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, Harry Lime. Starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten & Alida Valli.

This event is not included in Slaughter in Southwold day or weekend passes.
