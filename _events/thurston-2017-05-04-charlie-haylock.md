Charlie Haylock returns to Thurston Library.

Meet Charlie, chat to him and listen to one of his popular, hilarious talks â€“ an eccentric look at Suffolk and its language.

He is _the_ authority on the Suffolk dialect.

Not to be missed, as anyone who has been to one of his talks will tell you.

Tickets available from the library. Bar open from 6:30pm.
