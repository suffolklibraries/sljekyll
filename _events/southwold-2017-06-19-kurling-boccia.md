New Age Kurling is a fun and easy game. Much like regular kurling, it is played with adapted stones pushed at a target to score points against the opposing team. New Age Kurling can be played seated or from a standing position so is suitable for all!

Boccia is a cross between the French game of boules and traditional carpet bowls. A very easy an adaptable game for any age or ability, this can also be played from a seated or standing position and is great for team work.
