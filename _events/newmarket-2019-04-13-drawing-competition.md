Newmarket Lions Club are back with their annual children's Easter drawing competition. Every entrant will receive a free Easter egg (supply is limited so arrive early!), with the chance to win a bigger chocolate prize in the competition.

There are three age categories:

* Under 5 years
* 5-8 years
* 9-11 years

Judging will take place in private on 18 April and winners will be contacted shortly afterwards.
