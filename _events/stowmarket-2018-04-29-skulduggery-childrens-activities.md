Children aged 8+ are invited to learn how to solve crimes with Kinetic and share their funny pet stories with <cite>The Funny Life of Pets</cite> author James Campbell.

Don a CSI suit, dust for fingerprints, identify footprints and more at Kinetic's Library in a Lab workshop.

Writer and comedian James Campbell will be telling hilarious stories about cats, dogs, hamsters and more from his new book. He'd like you to share stories of your own pets if you like, but advises you not to wear your favourite pants because you might wet yourself laughing.

James first wanted to be a writer when he was seven. Before that he wanted to be a duck. Now he lives in Suffolk and spends a lot of time visiting local primary schools and making children laugh.
