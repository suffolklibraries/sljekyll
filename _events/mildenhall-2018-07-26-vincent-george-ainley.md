> "Rhea is an archaeologist searching for the final resting place of the legendary King Arthur. She is thrown into the murky world of Islamic fundamentalism and CIA operations that do not officially exist. On the run from killers, the only person she can turn to for help is Danny, the man whose heart she broke over a year ago; but she is desperate."
