Join us for a family-friendly murder mystery musical written by Sophie Hannah with music from Annette Armitage. With a serious puzzle and 13 catchy songs, it's like a cross between Agatha Christie's <cite>The Mousetrap</cite> and Tim Minchin's <cite>Matilda</cite>!

> "John Danes, a ‘generalist’ who does all sorts of strange jobs for all kinds of peculiar people, is about to set off to Idlewyld House when a strange man knocks at his door. This stranger knows John is expected at Idlewyld House, but he won’t say how he knows. When asked who he is, he says only ‘I am the murderer', and then he disappears.

> "Arriving at Idlewyld House, John asks if he has been invited there to solve a murder, and is assured that nothing of the sort has happened. Then one of the other guests is found dead at the foot of the stairs..."

This event is not included in Slaughter in Southwold day or weekend passes.
