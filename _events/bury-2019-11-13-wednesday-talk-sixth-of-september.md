Callista Bowright, the pen name for Alicia Wright and Stella Bowling, will be discussing their book [<cite>The Sixth of September</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2638571), a gritty, no holds barred emotional and good-humoured journey through two very opposite but very real lives of two women. Copies of the book will be available for purchase.

> "Olivia comes from a simple Lancashire background, where her terrible, traumatic childhood leads on to further drama, pain, and tragedy, which mould her into a tough, beautiful fighter. Sophie is raised in wealth and comfort; she has education, talent, and intellect but no confidence. She struggles, in her hippy way, through similar life experiences – and appalling losses – with nervous bravery. Both are sensual, raunchy, strong, and loving women, who defy society’s hypocrisy. Then, one September day, their worlds collide.

> "They could be bitter rivals, but they combine their strengths to face, and to cope with, the past and the present trauma. Although total opposites in many ways, they develop a strong bond and prove that former horrors, abuse, and wounds can be healed and used to develop formidable strength; that women are tough, intelligent, and capable; and that their lives must be lived true to their needs and beliefs. They live through searing reality, but their hopeful, humourous fight back makes them unforgettable."
