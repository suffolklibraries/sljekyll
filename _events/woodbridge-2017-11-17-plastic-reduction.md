Following September's highly successful showing of powerful plastic reductions film <cite>Bag It</cite>, Transition Woodbridge are holding an evening of action.

This evening will involve discussion and planning regarding positive actions that Woodbridge can take to reduce either our own personal plastic footprint or the town’s community as a whole – let’s make this town a healthier, less reliant and more resilient place to live. Please bring ideas!

Those working in food retail are very welcome to join us.

Refreshments will be available, no need to book.
