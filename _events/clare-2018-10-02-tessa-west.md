Author Tessa West will be at the library talking about her biography, [<cite>Lady Sue Ryder of Warsaw: single-minded philanthropist</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2359195):

> "There are numerous Sue Ryder charity shops throughout the UK, but few shoppers know much about their founder.

> "Miss Ryder was born into a privileged family and, when only 16, left school to join the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. This led to Special Operations Executive work where she met Polish airmen. In the chaos of the post-war period she provided food, medicine and clothing to those who were abandoned and had nothing.

> "In 1953 she established the Sue Ryder Foundation as 'a living memorial to the victims and opponents of tyranny'. In 1955 she married the famous Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, and the couple co-operated on more projects. Over the years she was awarded civic, military and academic honours, including several from Poland. In 1979, when she was made a life peer, she took the title Lady Ryder of Warsaw. This book is written so that Sue Ryder's name, work and life are not forgotten."
