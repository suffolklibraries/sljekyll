You're invited to work out whodunit at our murder mystery night.

Each booking includes a free raffle ticket. Come in Halloween fancy dress if you like - there's a prize for the best dressed!

There will be teams of up to six, but don't worry if you're on your own - you can join one on the night.

Bring your own food and drink. Donations of raffle prizes greatly appreciated.

Contact the library for tickets.
