James Hornsby returns to the library for a third year, following on from his acclaimed performances of <cite>Great Expectations</cite> and <cite>Dracula</cite>. Enjoy James bringing Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet To Come, Mr and Mrs Fezziwig and of course the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge to life in the inimitable style of Dickens' own legendary public readings.

Ticket price includes mulled wine and a mince pie during the interval.

Contact the library to book tickets. Proceeds to the Friends of Woodbridge Library.
