**This collection of short stories set and around the village of Blaxhall, Suffolk will be introduced by author Rosy Thornton.**

Rosy has previously published five novels, one of which, <cite>Ninepins</cite>, won the East Anglian Book Awards prize for fiction in 2012.

<cite>Sandlands</cite> is Rosy's first venture into short stories. The sixteen linked stories which make up the collection are all are set in and around the village of Blaxhall in coastal Suffolk and, as well as sharing a setting and one or two minor characters, are all closely connected in terms of theme: the natural world, wildlife and the cycle of the seasons; the relationship of people to their landscape; repeating patterns through the generations, and how the past is able to make itself felt in the present in various unexpected ways. Some of the stories are ghostly or magical; some are poignant and sad; one or two are funny.

Rosy was brought up in Suffolk, and has a home in the county, working in Cambridge during term time as a lecturer in law. She is an engaging speaker and has much to share about her varied writing career.
