Join us for a performance from classic jazz group Pick 'N' Mix. Tim, Chris, Ian and Steve will play an eclectic mix of jazz classics, pop and country music.

The four friends have played together and with other local groups for many years - you will have seen them at garden parties, pubs and country fairs. Their assortment of old favourites and the occasional lesser-known piece will set toes tapping.
