PLEASE NOTE: this event is on Friday 22 September and not Saturday 23 September as originally advertised.

Join Transition Woodbirdge for a screening of <cite>Bag It</cite>, with refreshments and an open discussion, including of actions that are happening locally.

> "Our crazy-for-plastic world has finally caught up to us. What can we do about it? Today? Right now?

> "<cite>Bag It</cite> follows “everyman” Jeb Berrier as he navigates our plastic world. Jeb is an average American who decides to take a closer look at our cultural love affair with plastics. Jeb’s journey in this documentary film starts with simple questions: What are plastic bags made from? What happens to them after they are discarded? What he learns quickly grows far beyond plastic bags.

> "When Jeb finds out he and his partner are expecting a child, his plastic odyssey becomes a truly personal one. How can they protect their baby from plastic’s pervasive health effects?

> "Jeb looks beyond plastic bags and discovers that virtually everything in modern society is made with plastic or contains potentially harmful chemical additives used in the plastic-making process. Two of the most common of these additives show links to cancer, diabetes, autism, attention deficit disorder, obesity and infertility.

> "As adults, we make all kinds of choices of convenience: single-serve bottles, small units of food and bath and beauty products. These products are both made with and come packaged in plastic. As a consequence of our modern day culture, we have become addicted to plastics, and they have quietly infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Even our children have unwittingly and alarmingly become our modern day lab rats.

> "<cite>Bag It</cite> makes it clear that it is time for a paradigm shift."
