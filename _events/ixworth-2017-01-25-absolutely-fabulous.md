Fun and mayhem guaranteed. 25 years on, a lot older and a lot fatter, Edina and Patsy return!

This screening is part of Friends of Ixworth Library (FOIL)'s new series of community film nights at the Village Hall. All proceeds support Ixworth Library.

All help and volunteers most welcome. If you'd like to get involved in programming or promoting these events, or helping on the night, please call Debra on [01359 760326](tel:01359760326).
