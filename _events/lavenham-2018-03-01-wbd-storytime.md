**This event has been cancelled as the library is closed due to poor weather conditions**

Preschoolers and their parents/carers are invited to join us for special World Book Day session in our usual Tot Rock slot.

Enjoy a fun telling of a story, pick up a free preschool pack from BookStart and come dressed as your favourite book character for the chance to win a prize.
