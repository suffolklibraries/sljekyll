**Create your own colourful characters and vivid locations in this workshop led by talented local author, Francesca Armour-Chelu.**

One of the key challenges in creative writing is creating believable characters and describing the places where they live. Francesca will help each child attending this workshop to achieve a good understanding of one of the ways in which authors achieve this.

The 90 minute session is designed to stimulate creative thinking in a fun and entertaining way. You will learn how to develop tools and gain confidence in producing your own stories, either in small groups or as individuals.

Francesca had her first book released this summer, by leading children's publisher Walker Books. Called <cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite> it is a fantastic adventure aimed at children, aged 9+, and is the first in a chilling series about a sinking world. It’s perfect for anyone who enjoyed the stories about Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl.

In a world that has been ravaged by flooding, Fenn Halflin learns the truth about his past – a secret that forces him to flee the safety of his home as he is chased across the vast sea by the ruthless Terra Firma and their cold-blooded leader, Chilstone. Finding shelter on a decaying island, Fenn is taken in by child survivors in hiding, and he begins a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the Terra Firma, who will stop at nothing to find him. But as Chilstone’s dreaded Fearzero ship appears on the horizon, and the water levels continue to rise, it seems that Fenn’s hopes of escape will be washed away for ever.

Francesca was born in Westleton, Suffolk, and after reading English and Drama at Goldsmiths, University of London, she returned to work in children’s education at Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich. When she’s not writing, she works for Suffolk Libraries at Halesworth Library.

Come and learn how to write your own gripping tales, and meet Francesca and Fenn Halflin!
