Join us for an evening with Pamela Holmes, author of [<cite>The Huntingfield Paintress</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1955518).

<cite>The Huntingfield Paintress</cite> brings a slice of Suffolk history to life beautifully. It's based on the true story of Mildred Holland, who decorates the highly celebrated ceiling of St Mary's Church, Huntingfield.

Pamela will also be discussing her new book <cite>Wyld Dreamers</cite>, due out later this year. 

Ticket price includes refreshments. Tickets available from the library.
