5-12 year-olds are invited for medieval-themed crafts, puzzles and games. Create your own castle, learn to play a real medieval game, and learn some fun medieval words and phrases.

Contemporary fancy dress is not essential but there will be a prize for the best costume.

All children must be accompanied by an adult. Tickets available from the library from 24 April.
