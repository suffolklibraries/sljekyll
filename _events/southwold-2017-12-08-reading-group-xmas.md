Are you in a reading group? All reading group members are welcome to this annual Christmas get together. A chance to compare notes, discuss group favourites (and the ones you hated!) and get recommendations for the new year.

Tea, coffee and squash provided but please bring nibbles and any other drinks to add to the eveningâ€™s offering.
