Calling all Horrible Scientists – here’s a rare chance to learn some gross funny Horrible Science experiments from the actual creator of the <cite>Horrible Science</cite> series – Nick Arnold!

Why not try them on your friends and family – for extra-squishy fun?

The best dressed mad scientists will win a prize!

Places are horribly limited so book now!

Recommended for ages 6-13, accompanying adults do not require a ticket.
