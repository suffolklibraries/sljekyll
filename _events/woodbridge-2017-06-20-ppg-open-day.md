Pop in to the library to chat to NHS and charity experts about dementia, and learn about Dementia Together Suffolk, a new service which offers a point of contact for dementia help and support in east and west Suffolk. Find out what help and support is available to dementia patients and their carers.

This event has been organised by the Patient Participation Group (PPG) of Dr Gary Taylor and Partners but is open to all.

Free refreshments provided.
