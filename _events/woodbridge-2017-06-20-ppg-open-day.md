Pop in to the library to give your views and discuss any concerns you have as a member of the Little St John's Street Surgery.

The Little St John’s Street Surgery Patients’ Participation Group was formed in February 2013 with the aim of developing a positive and constructive relationship between patients, the practice and the community. It helps ensure that the practice remains accountable and responsive to the needs of its patients.

The PPG meets regularly with representatives from the practice and discussions cover a wide range of issues. As well as engaging in what’s happening within the practice, it also reviews developments in the wider NHS which affects the surgery’s patients, such as record confidentiality, regulations and health care initiatives. The PPG takes appropriate actions not only to inform its patients, but also to represent its patients’ interests to the NHS and other groups.
