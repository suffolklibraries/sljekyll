> "While the lovelorn Duke Orsino plots to win the heart of the mourning Olivia, an alliance of servants scheme against the high-handedness of Oliviaâ€™s steward, the pompous Malvolio. When Orsino engages the cross-dressed Viola, who has disguised herself as a young man, to plead with Olivia on his behalf, a bittersweet and hilarious chain of events follows.

> "Outrageous high comedy ensues as the pangs of unrequited love affect the unforgettable characters in this Olivier-nominated, hilarious tale of misdirection and deception, performed by an all-male cast, as it would have been in Shakespeare's day."
