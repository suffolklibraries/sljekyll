Join us at our regular Sporting Memories reminiscence session for over-50s with special guest speaker James Easter.

James will share stories of his life in speedway as a promoter, international manager, tour organiser and much, much more. You are encouraged to bring your own speedway memorabilia and share your own memories.

The event will be taking place in our 1st floor Lecture Hall. Sporting Memories meets weekly and includes chats, games and activities.
