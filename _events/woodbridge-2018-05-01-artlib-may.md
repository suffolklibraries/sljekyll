Lorna has lived in Saxmundham for the last twelve years, previously having lived in Kent. She attends several local groups and it was at one of these groups that she met her art mentor Helena, who encouraged her to participate in this exhibition at Woodbridge Library. They both love art and wholly believe in the therapeutic benefits that art has.  

For Lorna, art is a gateway to expressing her thoughts and emotions and a way of relaxing her mind. She takes inspiration from everyday objects, seeing the beauty in shapes and patterns and then putting her own spin on these. Lornaâ€™s art is a study of simplistic naivety with a whimsical twist.
