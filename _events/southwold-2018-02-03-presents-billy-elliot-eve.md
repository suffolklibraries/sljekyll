Set in a northern mining town, against the background of the 1984-5 miners’ strike, Billy Elliot is the inspirational story of a young boy’s struggle against the odds to make his dream come true.

Billy’s journey takes him out of the boxing ring and into a ballet class where he discovers a passion for dance that inspires his family and whole community and changes his life forever.

Filmed live at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London.
