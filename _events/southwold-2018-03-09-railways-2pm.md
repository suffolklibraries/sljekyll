Go back to a time when travelling by rail was comfortable, punctual and maybe even glamorous!

Enjoy a major new collection of rare archive films produced by Creative Arts East as part of the BFI's Britain on Film project. Sourced from the national and regional archives and newly digitised, these films chart the history of the UK's railways and bring home the romance and heady freedoms offered by train travel as it expanded across the country in the early 20th century.

The fish & chip lunch is at 12.45pm and must be booked in advance.
