Drop in to the library to create a piece of lettering art featuring words and phrases you associate with the sea.

Your words and phrases will be collated by poet Dean Parkin and artist Gary Breeze to inspire a series of temporary typographic art installations around the town as well as a legacy engraving on the glass section of the new permanent flood defences.

Watertight Words is a cultural heritage project linked to the new sea defence wall which is being built in Lowestoft. It is part of [Making Waves Together](http://www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk/business/regeneration-projects/making-waves-together/) and working in partnership with the Lowestoft Flood Risk Management project.
