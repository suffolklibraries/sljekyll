> "Once upon a time there was a speedy Hare who never stopped talking about how fast he could run. Tired of being teased for his slowness, one day Tortoise challenged him to a race. No one thought he could win, but life is full of surprises!"

This unique children’s classic story is brought to life in colourful, fun, and engaging ballet performances, curated especially with young families and pre-schoolers in mind.

Each story is read for the cinema audience by BBC’s Anita Rani and includes dance move demos by the professional ballet dancers for children to try.  These bite sized ballets provide the perfect way to introduce young children to the artistic beauty of ballet in a comfortable, affordable, local family friendly setting while encouraging a fun trip to the cinema and an engaging interactive experience.

These ballets were originally shown on CBeebies, generating the most views for any CBeebies content during the three months they were shown. Now remastered and designed especially for cinema, we are delighted to be bringing these classic stories to the big screen.
