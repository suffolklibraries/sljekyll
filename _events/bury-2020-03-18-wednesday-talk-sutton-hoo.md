FULLY BOOKED!

Come along to our regular Wednesday Talk session to hear from Sutton Hoo staff about the history of the site and learn about some of the artefacts found there.

Why not chat to them and have a look at the [Sutton Hoo display](/events/bury-2020-03-18-sutton-hoo/) afterwards?

Advance booking by contacting the library is advised.
