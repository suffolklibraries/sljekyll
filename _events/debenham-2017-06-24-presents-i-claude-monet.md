Using letters and other private writings, this striking film from award-winning director Phil Grabsky reveals new insight into the man who not only painted the picture that gave birth to impressionism, but who was perhaps the most influential and successful painter of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Behind his sun-dazzled canvases, Monet suffered from feelings of depression and loneliness; he even contemplated suicide. However, his developing art and lovingly tended garden at Giverney brought out his humour, insight and love of life.

Licensed bar and ice creams available during the interval.
