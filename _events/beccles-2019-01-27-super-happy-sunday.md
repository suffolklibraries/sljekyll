In the depths of winter, so often we batten down the hatches and spend a lot of time indoors. We would like to invite you all out to join us in the library for an informal, drop-in event designed to boost your mood and wellbeing.

Relax and enjoy:

- Mindful colouring
- Materials and prompts for journalling and creative writing
- Positive paper-chaining
- Quiet sitting and reading area
- Puzzles

We hope to see lots of you there!
