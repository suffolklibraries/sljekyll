Families are invited to make an Easter basket, then pick up a trail quiz sheet to answer as you make your way to Landseer Road Methodist Church for an Easter egg hunt and refreshments. Complete the quiz to have a chance of winning an extra prize!

While you're on the trail, you can find out more about Gainsborough Community People's Forum and how you can have your say and help us make a difference in Gainsborough.
