Join Southwold Library and Beach Bonkers for a family fun day hosted by Southwold Boating Lakes & Tea Rooms.

Beach Bonkers will have a tableful of beachcombing treasures for you to explore, a mini-beach for you to search and a giant beachcombing board game to play.

Library staff will be telling seaside tales for you to enjoy.

Along with the opportunity to indulge in a cream tea or an ice cream it's the perfect way to spend a Sunday at the seaside!

Admission to this event is free although there may be a charge or donation requested for some activities.
