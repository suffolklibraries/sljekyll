A native of Suffolk for almost 40 years, Dick Dolan’s formal art education ended after O-Level although he sporadically sketched and painted for many years after that. Since retiring from teaching six years ago Dick has built a cabin in his garden which acts as his studio, and has approached developing his 'eye', his skills and his knowledge more purposefully.

He sketches and draws most days, preferring to work from small black and white sketches that he has done very recently to build landscape pieces or to work directly from objects for still life pieces.  The act of sketching (15 minutes of close looking, doing, analysing, interpreting, changing) leaves an emotional imprint that can be connected to again and reused.

Dick prefers to make a work in one sitting – "that is who I am today, that’s what I see today and that’s what I do today. Tomorrow I will be different, the light will be different, the subject will appear different and I will work in a different way."

Because of this philosophy, Dick’s work tends to be small, matching the time and concentration he has. Dick uses different mediums, a reflection of how his feelings and perceptions change. It's how he often explores a subject, creating eight versions of "Winter Fields, Blaxhall" before something arrived that was remotely acceptable to him.
