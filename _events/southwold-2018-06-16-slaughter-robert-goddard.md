Robert Goddard will be talking about his 27th thriller, <cite>Panic Room</cite>.

Robert was born in Hampshire in 1954 and read History at Cambridge. After pursuing several career options and spending ten years as a local government officer, he turned his hand to writing. He set out to tell a tightly constructed and densely plotted story engrossingly and satisfyingly, and 1986's [<cite>Past Caring</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=99956) was the result.

> "For 30 years Goddard has been my go-to guy for a certain kind of storytelling, full of easy charm blended with sinister menace, and propulsive pace with twisty plotting, and likable characters in bad situations." - Lee Child

There will be an opportunity to buy Robert's books from Beccles Books and have them signed after the talk.
