> "Beneath the sewers of the Paris Opera House dwells a masked figure. He is the Phantom, a hideously disfigured composer whose dream is to turn chorus singer Christine into a diva. Lon Chaney, the “Man of a Thousand Faces”, dominates this classic adaptation of the 1910 novel. His ghastly make-up and outrageous performance made this one of the great classics of American silent film."

Minima perform original live soundtracks to silent films, lending their images a 21st century interpretation. Formed in 2006, they are a Bristol-based four-piece group, with instrumentation including cello, double bass, baritone guitar, acoustic and electric guitars, mandolin, autoharp, dulcimer, synthesiser, glockenspiel and drum kit. Their sound is uncompromising and unique; in performance they use no backing tracks or pre-recorded material.
