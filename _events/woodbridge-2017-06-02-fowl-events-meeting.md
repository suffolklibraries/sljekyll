Anyone interested is invited to join the Friends of Woodbridge Library events group, FOWL-Eggs.

We meet up approximately once a month over tea and biscuits to discuss prospective activities and events to help raise funds for the library.

For more information please either come along, email Kellie Dimmock at kellie.dimmock@suffolklibraries.co.uk or contact the library.
