You're invited for a fun afternoon of music and dance. We'll be playing music through our sound system all afternoon and we've also got a great programme:

* 1pm - 2pm: Steel pan workshop
* 2pm - performance from singer Cherise Phillips
* 3pm - 4pm: Salsa workshop

There will also be a tombola, raffle, face-painting, a barbecue and more!

Book your place on the workshops in advance to avoid disappointment.
