Do you have artistic flair? Would you like to see your work on display in the library and the chance to win a Â£25 gift voucher? Why not enter our Christmas card competition in association with Framlingham Town Council?

All entries must be A5 size and your own original design. You can pick up an A5 card from the library/town council office.

Print your name, contact details and category (Primary, High School or Adult) on the back of your card and submit it to the library/town council office on Bridge Street on or before Thursday 30 November.

All entries will be displayed in the library building, and Dr Dan Poulter MP will choose a winner from each category on Friday 1 December.

For more information, ask at the library or call Lesley Clouting on [01728 723735](tel:01728723735) or Eileen Coe on [01728 720183](tel:01728720183).
