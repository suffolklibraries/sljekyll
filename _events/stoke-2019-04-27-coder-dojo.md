Are you aged 7 - 17? Do you want to learn how to build a website or create an app or game? Come along to start your programming journey at our CoderDojo, an informal, creative and social environment.

Bring your own laptop if you can - we will have a limited number available on the day for those who don't have their own to use.

Advance booking is required; contact the library or [book online](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/coderdojo-tickets-59058998053).

Under 12s must by accompanied by an adult.

Visit the [CoderDojo website](https://coderdojo.com/) for more information.
