Local poet Tim Bridges returns for another interactive poetry talk. Everyone is invited to bring along a poem - whether their own work or one that means something to them - to recite or have recited for them, or just to join in the discussion.

Tim will also introduce a couple of his own poems for discussion, if time allows.
