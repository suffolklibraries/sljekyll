Children aged 5+ and their parents are carers are invited for a spooky half-term event! Meet animals including snails, a bearded dragon, stick insects, duprasi, a scorpion, a frog and a snake.

The animal encounter will be followed by spell-writing and potion making so you can become a fully-fledged witch or wizard!

All children must be accompanied by a parent/carer. Tickets available in advance from the ground floor desk.
