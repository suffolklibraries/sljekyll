Learn something new, get a workout and help us raise funds for the library service on [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/). Take a self-defence workshop, then enjoy 5 minutes with the hit pads or kick shield in exchange for a donation.

Feeling organised? Pick up a sponsor form in advance from the library and get people to sponsor you to do 100 strikes in five minutes!

There will also be the chance to win prizes in our raffle.
