Would you like to put your very own personal message next to a letter of the alphabet on our book shelves in the lending library?  

As part of our [Suffolk Libraries Day](/suffolk-libraries-day/) celebrations, we're offering you the chance to select and sponsor a letter of the alphabet. See staff at the lending desk for more information and to sign up.
