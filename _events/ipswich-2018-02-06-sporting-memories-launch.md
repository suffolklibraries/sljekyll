Everyone is welcome to the official launch of our [Sporting Memories reminiscence groups](/news/sporting-memories/).

Hear former Ipswich Town players Roger Osborne and George Burley share their memories of winning the FA Cup in 1978. Former Olympian Professor Bill Tancred MBE will also be telling his sporting stories.

There will be the chance to find out more about the groups, try some gentle activities, and take part in a quiz and a spot the ball competition. You can also take a look at our display of Ipswich Town archive material, curated by Liz Edwards, the club's supporter liaison officer, which is currently in the display case at the entrance of the library.

The event will be opened by Cllr Tony Goldson, Suffolk County Councilâ€™s Cabinet Member for Health and Alison Wheeler, chief executive of Suffolk Libraries.

If you've got your own sporting memories, photos or memorabilia to share, we'd love you to bring them along.

There will also be free refreshments and the chance to win a pair of matchday tickets, both kindly provided by the East of England Co-op.
