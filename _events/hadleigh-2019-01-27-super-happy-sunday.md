Join us for adult colouring or children's crafts, or bring in your own craft from home to work on in a relaxing environment with others for [Super Happy Sunday](/news/super-happy-sunday/).

We also have [Yoga](/events/hadleigh-2019-01-27-yoga/) and [meditation](/events/hadleigh-2019-01-27-meditation/) taster sessions and wellbeing book displays.
