Hear author Gavin Milnthorpe talk about his latest novel, [<cite>Second Hand Scott</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2331637):

> "Scott Logan, AKA Second Hand Scott, specialises in picking up girls who have just been dumped, jilted or otherwise broken-hearted. But he isn't your stereotypical romantic cad and bounder. No; he actually thinks he's being helpful. But one day, Scott is forced to choose between his continued second hand existence and the possibility of true love."

Gavin is a commercial lawyer by day and a writer of fictional nonsense by night. He will also be talking about writing and getting published more generally.
