As part of local schools' Book Jam festival (13-19 November), we're holding a Human Library event for all ages.

Borrow a 'human book' and find out about other people's experiences. Talk one-to-one with a children's author (Andy Briggs, Francesca Armour-Chelu, James Campbell, Jane Elson and Steve Antony will be in attendance), a children's librarian, a partially sighted person, a late reader or someone with a mental health issue.

Refreshments available in return for a donation to Children in Need.
