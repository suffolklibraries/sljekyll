Join us in the Room at the Top for a screening of <cite>Stanley's War</cite>:

> "<cite>Stanley’s War</cite> dramatises stories of love and sacrifice, following the lives of Suffolk people during WWI. The film recounts the true life-changing experiences at the Western Front of Stanley Banyard, a farm hand from Ramsholt, Suffolk, and how he saved the lives of his comrades, lost in No Man’s Land, by using the skills he learnt as a boy from a Suffolk gamekeeper.

> "The film also follows the Pretty family, factory owners from Ipswich, and the forbidden romance between Major Frank Pretty, (4th Batallion, Suffolk Regiment) and Edith Dempster (later Edith Pretty of Sutton Hoo fame), as well as the tragic story of Lieutenant Donald Pretty (4th Batallion, Suffolk Regiment) killed in action on 11th May 1915.

> "The film was directed by Tim Curtis (<cite>Life on the Deben</cite>) with a screenplay written by Jonathan Ruffle, writer and creator of Radio 4's <cite>Tommies</cite>. The documentary parts are narrated by John McCarthy. Most of the rural drama scenes were shot in Suffolk."

Advance booking by contacting the library is essential.

Organised by the Friends of Felixstowe Library.
