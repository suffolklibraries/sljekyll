**Alison Bruce talks about writing thrillers with music from husband, Jacen.**

When Alison Bruce sits down to write her crime novels about Cambridge detective, DC Gary Goodhew, she likes to listen to music to set the scene and get her in the mind and mood of her characters.

For tonight’s very special event, she will introduce some of her husband's songs which are included on those playlists, and together they’ll talk about what it’s like living and working in such a creative household.

There are six novels following the career of DC Goodhew, and Alison has woven some of her own passions into each book. Find out what she has to tell us about classic British crime novels, American pulp fiction, black and white movies and TV crime. Alison will also introduce us to her forthcoming series, set in Ely.

And the evening will be accompanied by music from Alison’s husband, Jacen, who beguilingly promises “good feel, country rock and a good measure of Hawaiian themed love songs”.

It’ll be a night to remember!
