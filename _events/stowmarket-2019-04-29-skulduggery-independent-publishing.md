Pete Jennings and Ian Andrews will be talking frankly about the advantages and disadvantages of traditional (commercial) and independent (indie) publishing before they are joined by Danny Cuff for a panel discussion, chaired by Pauline Manders.

Pete Jennings has published both independently and with big names such as The History Press, Rider (an imprint of Edbury Press Random House) and Hodder & Stroughton. Ian Andrew has self-published to great acclaim, has his own indie publishing business, and advises to other authors who are thinking of publishing independently.
