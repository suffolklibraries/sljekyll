Join us at our regular Sporting Memories reminiscence session for over-50s with special guest, Olympian Paul Evans.

Paul is one of our most respected athletes, having competed in two Olympics and two World Championships. He holds 13 British distance running titles and has also won the Chicago Marathon, come second in the New York Marathon and third in the London Marathon. He broke the half-marathon British and European records as a veteran in the Great North Run at the age of 40. He will be offering fascinating insights into his career and memories. You are encouraged to share your own memories as well.
