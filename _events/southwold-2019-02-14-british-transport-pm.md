Join us for a collection of archive films produced by Creative Arts East as part of the BFI’s Britain on Film project, revealing hidden histories and forgotten stories of people and places from the UK’s film and TV archives. Clips include "The Heart is Highland", "Glasgow Belongs to Me", "Coasts of Clyde" and "A Letter for Wales".

The screening will be followed by an optional fish & chip lunch at 12:45pm.

Lunch must be booked in advance. Book online or contact the library or Arts Centre.
