Her hobbies include music roller skating, dressmaking, walking her dog in the countryside, and reading. Franky is a member of the Waveney Author Group.

In her latest book [<cite>The PepperAsh Clinch</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2386848):

> "A line of revellers, wending their drunken conga from the opening night party at The Fighting Cock, are brought to a sudden halt when their barbecue explodes.

> "Nora Stickleback struggles to manage the pub, control her alcoholic husband and keep her son away from temptation, when she suddenly finds herself with two extra teenagers to look after. Henry Stickleback nurses two passions, one for young Rosalie, the other for browsing car boot sales.

> "Meanwhile Quinny is haunted by a childhood memory and a habit he started in order to break an obsession."
