Jimmy Livingstone has recently fled from Hackney to seek asylum in Suffolk. On his poetry menu you’ll find plenty of food for thought, spicy observation, some fruity sauce and a generous sprinkling of 'funny', particularly when he’s talking about the shock of reaching middle age.

Jimmy trained at RADA and has performed, written and directed in theatre, animation and music, in recent years getting much acclaim as a singer/songwriter having released two albums and appeared as a support act to Lucinda Williams. Essentially, he’s a man of words and his recent reinvention as a spoken-word poet was always coming! He performed this summer at The Ink Festival in Suffolk. 

Tickets available on the door, or reserve in advance by emailing **jimmy.livingstone@blueyonder.co.uk**
