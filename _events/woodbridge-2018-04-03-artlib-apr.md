Laura Beardsell-Moore is a professional artist specialising in paintings inspired by the gardens, fields and woodlands around us.

Driven by a love of animals, flowers and trees, Laura hopes her paintings will not only give pleasure to others but will also enhance their appreciation of the local environment. 

Laura grew up in a small Suffolk village and returned to her roots after completing her degree at the Winchester School of Art. Her works are regularly exhibited in and around Suffolk and her fine art paintings and pet portraits are collected across the UK.
