The Rolls-Royce of English comedies, Oscar Wilde’s <cite>An Ideal Husband</cite> brings an act of political sin into the heart of the English home. An ambitious government minister, Sir Robert Chiltern, is on an assured smooth ascent to the top. Until Mrs Cheveley appears in London with damning proof of his previous financial chicanery, that is.

From the 2017 production at Vaudeville Theatre in London’s West End.
