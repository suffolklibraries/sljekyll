Artemis Cooper will be speaking about his new biography on the life of Elizabeth Jane Howard.

Elizabeth was a popular and best selling author is her own right. She won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize for her debut novel *The Beautiful Visit*. She was the author behind the beloved *The Cazalet Chronicle* series, as well as numerous other titles which were usually concerned about the way in which love can alter people. Her stepson, Martin Amis, credits her "energy and determination" for inspiring his own love of reading and writing.

Her style, sophistication and talent is well documented, as are her associations with famous literary figures of the time. Her most famous marriage was to Kingsley Amis.

Cooper interviewed Elizabeth several times over the years whilst she lived in Bungay, and met with many of her friends and family. He also had access to many of her personal documents. In his biography, he examines her thoughts and personality in the context of her novels and intriguing romantic relationships.
