Drop in to the library to find out about the work the Stroke Association does. Volunteers and staff from the charity will be on hand to tell you more and answer any questions you may have.

We also have a [talk on conquering stroke on Wednesday 22 May](/events/bury-2019-05-22-conquer-stroke/) and a [talk and health checks for older people on Friday 24 May](/events/bury-2019-05-24-top-time-stroke-assocation/).
