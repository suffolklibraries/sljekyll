Joy Spring was originally the signature tune of the great jazz trumpeter Clifford Brown. But in Woodbridge Joy Spring means the classic jazz quartet comprising piano, saxophone, bass and percussion. Join us for a really relaxing evening with enough up-tempo to keep your feet tapping!

Ticket price includes a drink; bar open throughout the evening.

Contact the library to book.
