Join us as we announce the winners of our children's short story competition and launch the book of the 50 best entries, published by Lavenham Press.

The book features a foreword from Alex Rider author Anthony Horowitz and two young writers will receive a signed copy.

The book will be available to buy for Â£5 and all proceeds will help support the library.
