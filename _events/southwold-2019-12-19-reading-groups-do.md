Are you part of one of Southwold Library's reading groups? Come along for our annual Christmas get-together. Meet other book lovers, chat about the books your group loved (and hated!) and get recommendations for the new year.

Tea, coffee and squash provided but please bring nibbles and any other drinks to add to the eveningâ€™s offering.
