We’ll be transforming Woodbridge Library into a Poetry Cafe for this very special evening with the remarkable poet Liz Lochhead.

Join us any time from 7pm. Buy a drink, find a table and listen to local musicians, before we are treated to a reading from Liz at 7.30pm.

Liz was Scots Makar – the Scottish equivalent of Poet Laureate – from 2011-2016, and Poet Laureate for Glasgow before that. She won the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2015. A true poet of the people, her work is popular, warm and witty but also challenging and fierce. She has published 18 books, from 1972’s <cite>Memo For Spring</cite> to a book of plays in 2012. Later collections, often written in Scots and Glasgow dialect, include <cite>True Confessions</cite> and <cite>New Clichés</cite> (1985), <cite>Bagpipe Muzak</cite> (1991), <cite>The Colour of Black and White</cite> (2003) and <cite>A Choosing</cite> (2011).

Tickets &pound;8.

It will be a memorable occasion, and more details will follow very soon!
