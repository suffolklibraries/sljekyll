excerpt: "Fancy reading a book with a blue cover? Join us in playing 'Beyond the Book Bingo' and be introduced to some great authors and books!"

The final challenge in our &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; activity booklet is book bingo. Each of the 25 bingo squares represents a different genre of book from _&#8216;something that scares you&#8217;_ and a _&#8216;book with a blue cover&#8217;_, to _&#8216;a book recommended by a friend_&#8216; and one _&#8216;with non-human characters&#8217;_. Hopefully this will introduce pupils to new genres and styles and encourage them to browse library shelves.

I am playing along and will update the list below with the books I read throughout the year. I am also asking for pupils to recommend books for me during my &#8216;Beyond the Book&#8217; assemblies &#8211; on the 11 January 2016, year 7 pupil Rachel from Ipswich Academy recommended _[Charlotte&#8217;s Web](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7810890?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(34981)&QRYTEXT=Charlotte%27s%20web)_ by E.B.White for my &#8216;with non-human characters&#8217; square!

It would be really powerful for teachers to play book bingo and to display their bingo sheets in classrooms.

If you would like to get involved you can print off the  <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beyond-the-Book-Bingo-sheet.pdf" rel="">Beyond the Book Bingo sheet</a> and play along. Don&#8217;t forget to tweet us your bingo reads to @SuffolkLibrary using #beyondthebook as you cross them off!
