    <h2>About WordPlay</h2>

    <p>All our libraries hold regular Baby Bounce, Tot Rock and Storytime sessions for babies and young children and their parents/carers. You can hear stories, sing, move and play with toys and instruments together. The sessions are free, informal and welcoming, with no need to book in advance.</p>

    <p>Research shows <a href="/news/impact-report-published/" class="underline custom-corporate-duck-blue">these activities are hugely valuable to children and their parents and carers</a>, improving literacy and providing a way for adults to socialise, often in remote, rural locations in Suffolk.</p>
