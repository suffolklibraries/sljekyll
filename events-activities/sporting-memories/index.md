**Do you love talking about sport?**

We've teamed up with the Sporting Memories Network to host six Sporting Memories reminiscence groups across our libraries from early 2018.

**Our Sporting Memories groups offer over-50s the chance to:**

* Handle superb sporting images and memorabilia from local and national collections
* Revisit and share memories of taking part in or watching sporting events
* Talk about any kind of sport, from football to speedway, cricket to athletics and beyond
* Enjoy sport-themed games, quizzes and gentle activities
* Banish loneliness and make new, like-minded friends.

**Sporting Memories Groups will run weekly at the following libraries:**
