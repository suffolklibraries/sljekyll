        <p class="mt0">Reading has enriched my life from the moment my parents first took me to Bury St Edmunds Library as an inquisitive toddler of two or three, and I found out how far you could travel with a book in your hand. Stories are important.</p>
        <p>Reading connects us to a past we've never known, creates a bond with our friends and families, and helps us articulate our hopes for the future. It has also given me a career that I love. Now, as a writer, those books, those libraries, and especially those readers, are more important to me than ever.</p>

        <p class="mt0">I struggled when I was at school and I was a reluctant reader. I wish I could lay the blame on video games, but I was never any good at them and the internet didn't exist to distract me. It was horrible to feel I was falling behind. So I began to read-up on subjects to help with my school work. Then something strange happened – I could feel myself grow in confidence as I acquired knowledge on my own initiative. Reading helped me so much, and it still does.</p>
        <p>With the huge distractions of today’s multi-media devices and games it’s all the more important to have library and school programmes to engage with children to see the benefits of reading for enjoyment and building confidence. They are vital.</p>

        <p class="mt0">Reading is the bedrock of civilisation. It's how we communicate complex ideas, how we offer comfort to the vulnerable and challenge the cruel. By reading the real and fictional lives of others we develop understanding and empathy. But most importantly of all, reading is just plain fun, and anything that encourages reading is something to be celebrated!</p>

        <p class="mt0">The importance of reading can never be underestimated. If a child can concentrate on a book, they can concentrate on anything that is important to them and this is how successful lives are built. Suffolk libraries are helping them to do exactly that.</p>
