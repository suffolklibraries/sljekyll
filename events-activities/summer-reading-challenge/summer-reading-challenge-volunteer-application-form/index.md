## We need you! Volunteering for the Summer Reading Challenge

<p>Volunteering is a vital part of the Summer Reading Challenge campaign as volunteers are needed to help with various roles throughout the summer including helping to sign up children in libraries, explaining how the reading challenge works, spend time talking to them about the books they have read and handing out rewards and incentives at the end of the challenge.</p>

<p>Ideally you need to be able to commit to 2–8 hours per week for a minimum of six weeks over the summer holidays but if you can’t commit to this and would still like to help out please talk to your local library about other opportunities.</p>

<p>We’re looking for people of all ages aged 13 and up to be volunteers.</p>

<p>You get something out of it too! It’s very rewarding, it’s great experience for anyone interested in working with children and it’s an ideal opportunity for students and young people. Many young people help out with the summer reading challenge to help them gain their Duke of Edinburgh’s or Arts Award.</p>

<p>In 2015 9,366 volunteers helped out with the Summer Reading Challenge across the country and many felt it benefited them:</p>

<ul>
<li>82% felt their skills had increased</li>
<li>78% said it made them feel part of their community.</li>
</ul>

<p>An independent research study into Summer Reading Challenge volunteers in 2014 found that:</p>

<blockquote>Volunteering… can have a positive effect on people’s sense of purpose, autonomy and happiness, and helps to develop skills, and self-esteem. For young people in particular, it can improve motivation at school and future employment chances.</blockquote>

<p>If you’re interested, you can <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/">contact your local library</a> now or apply online via the form on this page</p>

<h3>About Reading Hack</h3>

<p>This year any volunteers aged 13-24 who help us with the Summer Reading Challenge will be part of the official Reading Hack programme run by the Reading Agency. Reading Hack is led by young people who do reading activities and volunteering, called hacks, to gain skills and experience, so it’s of greater benefit to young people. For more information about being a Reading Hack volunteer visit <a href="http://readingagency.org.uk/young-people">readingagency.org.uk/young-people</a></p>.
