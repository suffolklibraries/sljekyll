It's nearly time for The Reading Agency's Summer Reading Challenge 2017. We're inviting children to maintain their reading skills over the summer holidays by:

<img src="/images/featured/featured-src-bart.jpg" alt="Bart the bloodhound" class="custom-br-50 mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

* Reading 6 books of their choice from our libraries
* Talking about them with our Summer Reading Challenge volunteers
* Receiving stickers and other incentives along the way.

This year's theme is <cite>Animal Agents</cite>. <cite>Horrid Henry</cite> illustrator Tony Ross has created a host of furry, slippery and feathered creatures who are ready to solve all kinds of crimes with their skills and natural instincts especially for the Summer Reading Challenge. Children across Suffolk will become very familiar with the characters as they rack up their rewards!

The Summer Reading Challenge will be running in [all of our libraries](/libraries/), including our Suffolk Libraries Local sessions at [Red Lodge](/libraries/red-lodge/), [Shotley](/libraries/shotley/) and [Moreton Hall](/libraries/moreton-hall/) (launching 16 May).

The Summer Reading Challenge helps to get &frac34; million children into libraries nationwide during the summer holidays, when children's reading can otherwise 'dip', causing problems when they return to school. The number of children taking part in Suffolk has been increasing every year since 2013. Last year, 8,354 children took part in the county, supported by hundreds of volunteers.
