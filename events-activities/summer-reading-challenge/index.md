# The Big Friendly Read is coming!

The Summer Reading Challenge is the UK's biggest reading for pleasure programme in libraries for primary school aged children, with 800,000 children taking part last year. 2015 was the most successful ever in Suffolk with over 8,200 children signing up and as 2016 is officially [Suffolk Libraries’ Year of Reading](/events-activities/our-year-of-reading), we hope that this summer will be another huge success.

This year's challenge runs from 16 July until 3 September.

## What's involved?

The Summer Reading Challenge encourages children to read six or more library books of their choice during the summer holidays with collectable incentives and rewards, plus a certificate, or medal for every child who reads all six. Children can sign up at their local library at the start of the summer holidays – it’s absolutely free and many libraries will also be running related activities through the holidays.

## Will you win a gold ticket?

## Volunteer!

The Summer Reading Challenge runs throughout the summer holidays but Suffolk Libraries are already on the lookout for volunteers to help support it. Volunteer support is a key part of the summer reading challenge and each library in Suffolk will be looking for help in running activities with children and listening to them discuss the books they have read.

## The Big Friendly Read

The ‘Big Friendly Read’ will feature some of Roald Dahl's best-loved characters and the amazing artwork of his illustrator, Sir Quentin Blake. It will encourage reading on a giant scale and will feature themes such as invention, mischief and friendship as explored in Roald Dahl's books.

The Big Friendly Read will encourage children to expand their own reading by exploring similar themes across the best contemporary children's writing and this year’s suggested book list covers these themes. The book list covers 72 different books children might like to read for the challenge and includes Roald Dahl's much loved <cite>The BFG</cite>, with Disney's <cite>The BFG (Big Friendly Giant)</cite> directed by Spielberg and starring Mark Rylance, being released in cinemas on 22 July as the Summer Reading Challenge gets underway.

For more information, go to [the Summer Reading Challenge website](http://www.readingagency.org.uk/summerreadingchallenge).

As with previous years there is also a free interactive app provided by SOLUS UK Ltd which will allow children and families to activate extra The Big Friendly Read materials.
