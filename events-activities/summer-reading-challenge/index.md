# Summer Reading Challenge 2016: The Big Friendly Read

The Summer Reading Challenge is the UK's biggest reading for pleasure programme in libraries for primary school aged children, with 800,000 children taking part last year.

This year's challenge runs from 16 July until 3 September.

## What's involved?

Children read 6 or more library books of their choice during the summer holidays collecting incentives and rewards whenever they finish a book. They get a certificate or medal when they read all 6.

Children can **sign up at their local library** – it’s free and many libraries run related activities through the holidays.

## Will you win a gold ticket?

## About the Big Friendly Read

The ‘Big Friendly Read’ will feature some of Roald Dahl's best-loved characters and the amazing artwork of his illustrator, Sir Quentin Blake. It will encourage reading on a giant scale and will feature themes such as invention, mischief and friendship as explored in Roald Dahl's books.

The Big Friendly Read will encourage children to expand their own reading by exploring similar themes across the best contemporary children's writing and this year’s suggested book list covers these themes.

The book list covers 72 different books children might like to read for the challenge and includes Roald Dahl's much loved <cite>The BFG</cite>, with Disney's <cite>The BFG (Big Friendly Giant)</cite> directed by Spielberg and starring Mark Rylance, being released in cinemas on 22 July as the Summer Reading Challenge gets underway.

For more information, go to [the Summer Reading Challenge website](http://www.readingagency.org.uk/summerreadingchallenge).

As with previous years there is also a free interactive app provided by SOLUS UK Ltd which will allow children and families to activate extra The Big Friendly Read materials.
