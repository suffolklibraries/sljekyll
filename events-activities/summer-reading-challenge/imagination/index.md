## Suffolk Libraries and ImagiNation East Presents: Read Me - Awesome Art & Refreshing Reads

<img src="/images/article/logo-imagination.png" alt="ImagiNation logo" class="{% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" />

If you are aged between 11 and 18, enjoy reading and want to show off your creative talents, then sign up for ImagiNation: Read Me 2016 this summer at Suffolk Libraries!

To get involved, simply visit your local branch of Suffolk Libraries from Saturday 16 July to sign up and grab your Read Me log book. Read two books of your choice, fire up your imagination and show the world how creative you can be!

You don’t have to be ‘good at drawing’ and you don’t have to write lots if you don’t want to: instead you could paint a picture about how reading makes you feel, design a new book character, create a promo trailer for your favourite book, write a poem, cut-up a poem, use your musical skills to compose a bookish theme tune… anything creative that sparks your imagination!

You can share your art and ideas with other young people on [the ImagiNation blog](http://imaginationeast.org.uk/1679-2/) and be part of a collaborative artwork being made in a library near you.

Hand in your completed log book at your local library by Saturday 3rd September 2016 to claim your reward!

ImagiNation runs between Saturday 16th July and Saturday 3rd September 2016.
