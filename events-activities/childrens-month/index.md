      <p>This Children’s Month we’re running a special prize draw. Anyone who signs up their child or children for their first library card will be entered into a draw to win an iPad. You don’t have to do anything else to enter – just make sure you include your email address when you sign up.</p>

      <p>Getting a library card is free and you can <a href="/help/joining-the-library/" class="blue underline">join online</a>.</p>

      <p>This year’s theme is nature, celebrating the lovely specially commissioned Mouse and Mole artwork from local illustrator James Mayhew.</p>
