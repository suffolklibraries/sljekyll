        <p>In the New York City Ballet’s famously extravagant staging of Tchaikovsky’s beloved melodies, one of the most complex theatrical staged ballets in the Company’s active repertory, George Balanchine’s stunning choreography shines amidst awe-inspiring set pieces, ornate costumes and grand one-of-a-kind visual effects including a Christmas tree that grows to a height of 40 feet.</p>

        <p>A sensational new dance event for cinemas from the internationally acclaimed choreographer Matthew Bourne.</p>

        <p>Loosely based on Bizet’s popular opera, Carmen, with one of the most thrilling and instantly recognisable scores in classical music, the familiar 19th Century Spanish cigarette factory becomes a greasy garage-diner in 1960’s America where the dreams and passions of a small-town are shattered by the arrival of a handsome stranger. Fuelled by heat and desire, the inhabitants are driven into an unstoppable spiral of greed, lust, betrayal and revenge.</p>
