# Globe on Screen: The Comedy of Errors

[Hadleigh Library](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/hadleigh-library)· 20 Apr, 1400, doors 1330 · £7.50

Take one pair of estranged twin brothers (both called Antipholus), and one pair of estranged twin servants (both called Dromio), keep them in ignorance of each other and throw them into a city with a reputation for sorcery, and you have all the ingredients for theatrical chaos. One Antipholus is astonished by his foreign hospitality; the other enraged by the hostility of his home town. The Dromios, caught between the two, are soundly beaten for obeying all the wrong orders.

Basing his plot on a farce by Plautus, Shakespeare caps the mayhem of his Roman original to build up a hectic tale of violent cross-purposes, furious slapstick and social nightmare.

# About

Suffolk Libraries Presents is a new project which brings quality theatre and exhibition events to Suffolk communities using the latest digital screening equipment.

It’s funded by Arts Council England and runs in seven of the county’s libraries with the aim of bringing more Suffolk residents into contact with the arts in a familiar and accessible local venue.

Digitally recorded, internationally acclaimed performance and exhibition events will be screened using the latest projection equipment in Stradbroke, Felixstowe, Ixworth, Gainsborough, Hadleigh, Lowestoft and Capel St Mary libraries.

The performances will include the Globe Theatre’s productions of Julius Caesar and The Comedy of Errors; well-known ballets such as Matthew Bourne’s productions of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake; and unique, commentated tours of visual art exhibitions featuring artists such as Matisse, Rembrant and Van Gogh.
