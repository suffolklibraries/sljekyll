# Globe on Screen: The Comedy of Errors

![Comedy of Errors actors sitting on the floor](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/comedy-of-errors.jpg)

[Hadleigh Library](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/hadleigh-library)· 20 Apr, 1400, doors 1330 · £7.50

Take one pair of estranged twin brothers (both called Antipholus), and one pair of estranged twin servants (both called Dromio), keep them in ignorance of each other and throw them into a city with a reputation for sorcery, and you have all the ingredients for theatrical chaos. One Antipholus is astonished by his foreign hospitality; the other enraged by the hostility of his home town. The Dromios, caught between the two, are soundly beaten for obeying all the wrong orders.

Basing his plot on a farce by Plautus, Shakespeare caps the mayhem of his Roman original to build up a hectic tale of violent cross-purposes, furious slapstick and social nightmare.
