<p>Suffolk is a beautiful county, full of variety, and is a rich source of inspiration for authors, poets and artists.</p>

<p>Last year saw the launch of our county-wide initiative to celebrate books and reading in Suffolk and this year we hope to be even bigger and better.</p>

<p>Taking place from Friday 21 October until Sunday 30 October, there are author talks and activities taking place at libraries in Beccles in the north of the county, along the coast at Southwold, Aldeburgh and Felixstowe, and down to Newmarket and Sudbury in the south.</p>

<p>This year we will be working on a programme of activities and events for children in association with the Lavenham Childrenâ€™s Book Festival which takes place for the first time, on 29-30 October.</p>

<p>But every day, all year round, the library teams are putting on activities and courses, hosting community groups and running story times and book groups. And Suffolk Libraries are beautiful venues to explore with their own stories to tell.</p>

<p class="mb3">We have an award-winning library with a Post Office in Stradbroke, a beautiful old reading room with magnificent stained glass windows in Ipswich, one of the oldest public libraries in the country at Rosehill, a converted wartime anti-radiation unit at Broomhill, and historic collections held at Lowestoft and Newmarket.</p>
