Suffolk Libraries Bookfest runs this year from 21-30 October.

Last year saw the launch of our county-wide initiative to celebrate books and reading in Suffolk and this year we hope to be even bigger and better.

There are author talks and activities taking place at libraries from Lowestoft in the north of the county, along the coast at Southwold, Aldeburgh and Felixstowe, and down to Hadleigh and Sudbury in the south.

Suffolk is a beautiful county, full of variety, and is a rich source of inspiration for authors, poets and artists.

Our libraries reflect this diversity and creativity too. We have an award-winning library with a Post Office in Stradbroke, one of the smallest libraries in the country in Debenham, a beautiful old reading room in Ipswich, and historic collections held at Sudbury and Newmarket.

This year we will be working on a programme of activities and events for children in association with the Lavenham Childrenâ€™s Book Festival which takes place for the first time, on 29-30 October.

Sign up to our mailing list to be the first to know about authors and events as they are confirmed.
