          <p>The Summer Reading Challenge gets around 700,000 children into libraries each year to keep up their reading skills and confidence during the long holidays. <strong>It’s fun, it’s free and it’s local!</strong></p>

          <p>Embedding a love of reading in children can help their wellbeing later in life. 19% of adult readers say that reading stops them feeling lonely.</p>

          <p>Studies have found that those who read for pleasure have higher levels of empathy, greater self-esteem and are better able to cope with difficult situations.</p>

          <p><strong>Anything!</strong> At the heart of the Challenge is children choosing and sharing any books – in any format – that they like. Novels, fact books, joke books, e-books and audio books all count and your library has staff and volunteers to help your child choose books they will really enjoy. Teachers tell us that children return to school with a new enthusiasm for reading too.</p>
