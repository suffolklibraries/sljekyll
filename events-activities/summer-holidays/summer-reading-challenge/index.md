We're excited to announce this year's Summer Reading Challenge Theme: **Mischief Makers**, inspired by the much loved iconic children's comic the <cite>Beano</cite>, which celebrates its 80th anniversary this year.

The challenge runs from Saturday 21 July to Sunday 2 September, with some libraries holding special early registration events. Children aged 4-11 are invited to sign up at their local library to read six library books of their choice, collect special stickers and other incentives along the way and receive a certificate and other goodies at a special presentation in the autumn.

The Summer Reading Challenge takes place every year during the summer holidays and helps get three quarters of a million children into libraries across the country.

It’s a fun and engaging way of encouraging children to keep reading during the long summer holidays, when reading can dip if they don’t have regular access to books and encouragement to read for pleasure. The campaign is produced by the Reading Agency and delivered by libraries.

To help children choose what to read, The Reading Agency have compiled a [collection of 70 books which capture the Mischief Makers spirit](https://readingagency.org.uk/children/news/mischief-makers-book-collection-announced.html). These brilliant books have been chosen by children and librarians and include many brand new titles due to be published this summer.

The Summer Reading Challenge will be running across all 44 of our libraries as well as the weekly Suffolk Libraries Local sessions in [Shotley](/libraries/shotley/) and [Rushmere](/libraries/rushmere/). We will also be running ImagiNation, an arts and literature activity for young people aged 10-18.
