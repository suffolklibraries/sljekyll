Aged 10-18? Planning some holiday reading? Why not create a creative reaction to the books you read over the summer for our ImagiNation hack?

Come to a library between 15 July and early September, choose and read a book, then come back and create a 'belly band' to wrap around it. It will go on the ImagiNation display where other people can see it and be inspired to read it too.

You can write or draw almost anything on the band. We've come up with just a few suggestions to get you started:

* A drawing inspired by a scene from the book
* A poem
* A book review
* A love letter to the book

You can read as many books and create as many belly bands as you like. We encourage you to sign up and share your creations on the [ImagiNation blog](http://imaginationeast.org.uk/) if you're 12 or under and the [Reading Hack website](http://readinghack.org.uk/hacks/469) if you're 13 or over. You'll even get a reward at the end of the summer for taking part.
