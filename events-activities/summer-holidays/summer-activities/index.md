We've got lots of children's events taking place across our libraries over the summer holidays. [Contact your local library](/libraries/) to find out about any additional events they have planned.

We're also running the [Summer Reading Challenge](/src/) for 4-11 year-olds. Why not [sign up for our Summer Reading Challenge newsletter](/events-activities/summer-holidays/summer-reading-challenge/sign-up/) or [find your next read with our children's book recommendations](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/)?
