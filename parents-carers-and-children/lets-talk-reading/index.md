Let's Talk Reading is a voluntary project that aims to <strong>eradicate low literacy in Ipswich by 2025</strong> by supporting communication and reading for children and adults. It works in conjunction with early years providers, schools and community organisations.

## What we do

Let's Talk Reading **supports parents who are struggling to read** to become more confident in talking and reading with their children and to improve their own literacy skills.

A child without good reading, writing and communication skills can't succeed at school, and as an adult they could be locked out of the job market.

## Did you know?

* One person in six in the UK struggles to read. These low literacy skills impact on every area of their life.
* Around 15% of adults in England would not pass an English GCSE and have literacy levels at or below those expected of an 11-year-old. Nearly half of these people are unable to read safety signs and instructions on medicines.
* Reading for pleasure is more important for children's development and achievements in life than their background.
* Parents and carers who are confident readers are more likely to help children become confident and enthusiastic readers themselves.

## Who we are

Let's Talk Reading is a voluntary project funded through through grants from Ipswich Borough Council and other sources including the Suffolk County Councilâ€™s Raising the Bar Project in its first year.

It consists of a part-time paid co-ordinator and a small number of volunteers. It has been based at Suffolk Libraries since it launch in summer 2016, but aims to become an independent charity later in 2018.

After a very successful start, it is expanding the scope of its activities.
