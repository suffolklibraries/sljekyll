## [<cite>Being a Girl</cite>, by Hayley Long & Gemma Correll](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1763170)

> "Being a girl is not all sugar and spice. How can you possibly survive school and even think about talking to your crush when you have spots in places you didn't even know you had, your boobs are too big (or too small) and the friend drama is off the charts? Luckily, Hayley Long provides a straight-talking guide to puberty - from cattiness to kisses, and everything in between."

## [<cite>Being a Boy</cite>, by Juno (formerly James) Dawson & Spike Gerrell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1470655)

> "Queen of Teen nominee and acclaimed young adult author and former PSHCE teacher Juno Dawson expertly guides boys through puberty, dealing with crucial topics such as surviving the social scene, learning about sex, how to pull and dealing with spotty faces."

## [<cite>A-Z of Growing Up, Puberty and Sex</cite>, by Lesley de Meza & Stephen de Silva](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315058)

> "This is a ready-reference guide for older kids and teenagers to get the info they need on growing up, puberty and sex."

## [<cite>The Girl Guide</cite>, by Marawa Ibrahim & Sinem Erkas](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2159184)

> "Five times world-record breaking hula-hoop star Marawa Ibrahim was told that she was too chubby during her teenage years to succeed as a performer. Today she is one of the most solicited circus performers worldwide, working with artists from Pharrell Williams, to Beyonce and Kenzo. Contained within these pages are 50 lessons, anecdotes and stories about the changes Marawa experienced in her own body during puberty."

## [<cite>Doing It! Let's talk about sex</cite>, by Hannah Witton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2132556)

> "Sexting, virginity, consent, the big O...let's face it, doing it can be tricksy. I don't know anyone (including myself) who has sex all figured out. So I've written a book full of honest, hilarious (and sometimes awkward) anecdotes, confessions and revelations. And because none of us have all the answers, I've invited some friends and fellow YouTubers to talk about their sexuality, too.

> "We talk about doing it safely. Doing it joyfully. Doing it when you're ready. Not doing it. Basically, doing it the way you want, when you want."

## [<cite>Doing It Right: making smart, safe, and satisfying choices about sex</cite>, by Bronwen Pardes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1454239)

> "Teens can often find sex very difficult to navigate. Maybe the time is now, maybe it's years away. No matter what, they need to be ready both in their minds and bodies. All teens have questions and they can't always ask their parents and friends for answers.

> "Thankfully 'The Sex Lady' breaks it down in <cite>Doing it Right</cite>, which deals with issues like STIs, birth control and being emotionally ready. The more teens know and understand about the issues surrounding sex, the easier it is for them to make safe, smart and satisfying decisions about their sexuality."

## [<cite>This Book is Gay</cite>, by Juno (formerly James) Dawson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1646443)

> "Former PSHCE teacher and acclaimed YA author Juno Dawson, formerly known as James Dawson, gives an uncensored look at sexual orientation and gender identity. Including testimonials from people across the gender and sexual spectrums, this frank, funny, fully inclusive book explores everything anyone who ever dared to wonder wants to know - from sex to politics, how to pull, stereotypes, how to come out and more."

## [<cite>Beyond Magenta: transgender teens speak out</cite>, by Susan Kuklin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2003875)

> "Author and photographer Susan Kuklin met and interviewed six transgender or gender-neutral young adults and used her considerable skills to represent them thoughtfully and respectfully before, during, and after their personal acknowledgment of gender identity. Portraits, family photographs and candid images grace the pages, augmenting the emotional and physical journey each youth has taken."

## [<cite>How to be Happy: a memoir of sex, love and teenage confusion</cite>, by David Burton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2176514)

> "A funny, sad and serious memoir, <cite>How to Be Happy</cite> is David Burton's story of his turbulent life at high school and beyond. He longs to have a girlfriend, but his first date is a disaster. There's the catastrophe of the school swimming carnival and friendships that take devastating turns. Then he finds some solace in drama classes with the creation of 'Crazy Dave', and he builds a life where everything is fine. But everything is not fine. And, at the centre of it all, trying desperately to work it all out, is the real David."
