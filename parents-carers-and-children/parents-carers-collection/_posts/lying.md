## [<cite>Dogs Can't Fly</cite>, by Katharine Eccles Horn](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1339520)

> "Dogs can't fly, but then Blink is not a dog; he is a small, mischievous, purple dragon. Only Danny can see what Blink is, but Danny is a scruffy 11-year-old with a reputation for lying, so who would believe him if he told them?"

## [<cite>This is Not My Hat</cite>, by Jon Klassen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1639716)

> "When a tiny fish shoots into view wearing a round blue top hat (which happens to fit him perfectly), trouble could be following close behind. So it's a good thing that enormous fish won't wake up. And even if he does, it's not as though he'll ever know what happened - will he?"

## [<cite>I Want My Hat Back</cite>, by Jon Klassen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1239226)

> "The bear's hat is gone and he wants it back. Patiently and politely he asks the animals he comes across whether they have seen it. Each animal says no, some more elaborately than others. But just as he begins to lose hope a deer comes by and asks a question that suddenly sparks the bear's memory."

## [<cite>The Boy Who Cried Ninja</cite>, by Alex Latimer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=105130)

> "Once there was a boy named Tim whom no one believed, even when he was telling the truth. No one believed that it was a ninja who snaffled the last slice of cake; or that a giant squid ate his homework; or that it really was a time-travelling monkey who was throwing pencils at Grampa. How can Tim get his parents to believe him?"

## [<cite>Pig the Fibber</cite>, by Aron Blabey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1812930)

> "Pig the Pug is back and this time he is telling great big lies. From shattered vases to stinky parps, when Pig gets into trouble he always blames his long-suffering friend, Trevor.

> "But when Pig comes up with a super sneaky plan to steal all of the tasty treats he pays the price for his fibs. Will Pig the Pug learn his lesson at last?"
