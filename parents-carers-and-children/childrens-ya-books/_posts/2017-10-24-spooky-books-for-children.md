> "In order to save her life and those of her classmates, Zazie must find a way to get rid of Mr Labat - and what better way than by following the advice found in Bram Stoker's <cite>Dracula</cite>."

## [<cite>Scream Sea</cite>, by Marcus Sedgwick & Pete Williamson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1368407)

And when the King's spoiled son Tangine captures Squashy, Amelia and her friends must escape the party to plan a daring rescue! In their race against time, they begin to realise things in Nocturnia may not be quite what they seem."
