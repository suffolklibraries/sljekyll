![A First Book of Animals, Ada's Ideas, Survivors of the Holocaust](/images/featured/featured-non-fiction-prizes.jpg)

If your child wants to nurture a particular interest, or prefers non-fiction to fiction, why not reserve a book from the Royal Society Young People's Book Prize or School Library Association Information Book Award shortlists?

The Young People's Book Prize celebrates the best books that communicate science to young people and is chosen by groups of young people from schools, libraries, Scouts and Brownies, science centres and youth groups.

The Information Book Award aims to reinforce the importance of non-fiction books for children and is judged by librarians, SLA board members and a member of Peters Bookselling Services. There is also a 'Children's Choice' vote in each age category: under 7, 7-12 and 12-16.
