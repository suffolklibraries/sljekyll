## Board books

### [<cite>Moo: a noisy farmyard tale</cite>, by Jonathan Litton & Fhiona Galloway](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2095026)

This rhyming board book from Little Tiger Press oozes with potential for audience participation. It’s sturdy, brightly coloured and has the most inviting-looking die cut holes on each page. Great to develop fine motor as well as language skills.

### [<cite>My First Baby Animals</cite>, by Violet Peto](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2092732)

Packed full of photos, this is a great book new DK book for babies and toddlers to "browse" through. There’s a good variety of animals to look at and talk about, in a pleasing format for small hands.

### [<cite>In the Garden</cite>, by Smriti Prasadam-Halls](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2102132)

From a new board book series called <cite>Pairs!</cite>, this is not for babies. It is a lift-the-flap memory game, perfect for absorbing the attention of inquisitive toddlers and pre-school children.

The companion volume [<cite>Underwater</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2102131) would be great to use before, during or after a trip to the seaside.

### [<cite>Ouch! I Need a Plaster!</cite>, by Nick Sharratt](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2101663)

> "Have you ever bashed your nose? Scraped your knee? Stubbed your toe? Then this story is just for you! Come and meet Paul, Greg and Jacinta who all know how to say, 'Ouch! I need a plaster!'."

This lovely chunky title is a welcome addition to our collection of board books. It’s a simple rhyming counting book featuring diverse accidents and children.

### [<cite>Minibeasts</cite>, by Dawn Sirett & Charlotte Milner](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2092735)

A gorgeous board book for toddlers and pre-schoolers, with glittery trails to finger trace, stunning photographs and die-cut holes too.

This is packed with facts to absorb as well, as is [<cite>Baby Dinosaurs</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2092730) in the same <cite>Follow the Trail</cite> series from DK.

### [<cite>Puppies</cite>, by Carrie Love](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080119)

> "From furry ears to sticky paw prints, there are all sorts of textures for baby to explore in this safe, sturdy book that encourages early learning."

Consisting entirely of very cute puppy photos with tactile enhancements, this little board book should prove very popular with our youngest customers.

## Picture books

### [<cite>I Want a Friend</cite>, by Anne Booth & Amy Proud](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2116431)

> "'I want a friend,' said Arthur, 'I want a friend right now. I want to make one RIGHT AWAY But I am not sure how'. Join Arthur at nursery school in his determined search for a friend - could he dig a hole to trap one, or catch one in a net?"

This useful book is a sweet rhyming story about a little boy who wants to find someone to play with at nursery but isn’t sure how to go about it.

### [<cite>The Pirates of Scurvy Sands</cite>, by Jonny Duddle](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1998205)

> "This summer, Matilda is going on holiday with her friends, the Jolley-Rogers. Their destination is the island of Scurvy Sands - a favourite holiday destination for pirates. When Matilda arrives, the swashbuckling residents are none-too impressed with her. She has clean teeth, tidy clothes and doesn't smell like she's been at sea for 6 months - they are certain she cannot be trusted. But when Matilda discovers the secret of the legendary treasure of Scurvy Sands, the pirates are very quick to change their minds."

A new swashbuckling title from Jonny Duddle with awesome adventures and ingenious illustrations always comes high on our wish list, and this one looks as exciting as his previous books!

### [<cite>There Was an Old Dragon Who Swallowed a Knight</cite>, by Penny Parker Klostermann & Ben Mantle](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2072995)

> "This old dragon is very hungry! And he's not going to stop until he's gulped down almost the entire kingdom, knight's armour and all. But is there any way of escape from a lazy dragon's gut? Perhaps a good belch will help."

This re-take on the traditional rhyme is very funny, if a little difficult to get your tongue around in places. We think it will be very popular with playgroups.

### [<cite>Thank Goodness for Bob</cite>, by Matthew Morgan & Gabriel Alborozo](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078807)

> "Max is a child who worries. A lot. He worries about being bitten by spiders, abducted by aliens, or sometimes just that people don't like him enough. Soon it feels like his worries might take over the world! Thank goodness for Bob the dog, who shows Max that the best way to deal with worries is to share them with a friend."

Very few books for young children deal with anxiety, but this picture book does so with ease. The sweet illustrations perfectly complement the gentle text. It’s bound to be popular, so we’ve bought lots of copies.

### [<cite>The Naughty Naughty Baddies</cite>, by Mark Sperring & David Tazzyman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2112557)

> "Once there were four Naughty, Naughty Baddies. And each one was as naughty as the next. They liked nothing more than being diabolically dreadful. But best of all, they loved creeping.

> "When Four suggests a cunning plan to steal all the spots off the Queen's Little Doggy Woof-Woof, they all grin fiendishly and chuckle evilly as they creep, creep, creep. What will the Queen do when she sees her spotless Little Doggy Woof-Woof? Where is the King sitting as they creep, creep past? (Clue: a throne of sorts.) Will the Naughty, Naughty Baddies get away with it?"

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>The Pest in the Nest</cite>, by Julian Gough & Jim Field](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2082481)

Rabbit and Bear are back in a second funny story, illustrated so expressively by Jim Field. In this book, poor old Rabbit can’t bear listening to Bear’s snores and is driven to distraction by the feverish drilling of a woodpecker.

### [<cite>Henry Pond the Poet</cite>, by Dick King-Smith and Victor G. Ambrus](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2110810)

> "Henry is a toad with a passion for poetry. He has many admirers, but Victoria Garden-Pool isn't one of them. His lines are lost on her as she crawls off with her burly beau, Larry. But Henry is determined to win her over."

New dyslexia-friendly edition of the late master storyteller's froggy tale.

### [<cite>A Race for Toad Hall</cite>, by Tom Moorhouse & Holly Swain](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2120282)

> "Teejay, Mo, and Ratty really shouldn't be exploring the overgrown grounds of Toad Hall - but that's never stopped them before. This time, though, they fall into a tunnel. Undaunted by tales that the Hall is haunted, they find something - someone - in the ice house. It's none other than Mr Toad, and he's been there for a hundred years."

<cite>The Wind in the Willows</cite> reimagined for a new younger audience – how cool is that? As cool as an ice house perhaps? The second title in this new series is due in August.

### [<cite>Stop the Monsters</cite>, by Helen Murray](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108913)

> "Join the brave Nexo Knights, Clay, Lance, Axl, Aaron and Macy, as they use powerful weapons and magic to battle the evil Jestro and his band of monsters. Learn about the futuristic realm of Knighton and discover the knights' battle secrets, go on thrilling quests, and engage in heroic battles against beastly, magical monsters."

They’ve watched it on the TV, and now courtsy of DK they can read about <cite>Lego Nexo Knights</cite> too.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>The Dragon with a Chocolate Heart</cite>, by Stephanie Burgis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100232)

A fierce dragon, Aventurine, is tricked into becoming a human in this fantasy aimed at the confident end of KS2. But then the chocolate drink was so tempting.

Holly Webb says it’s "funny, moving and deliciously full of chocolate!" Hilary McKay describes it as "a magical treat of dragons and heroines, with the best of all possible flavours." And we say let’s curl up with it over a mug of cocoa.

### [<cite>The Jamie Drake Equation</cite>, by Christopher Edge](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2105233)

Jamie’s dad is an astronaut aboard the International Space Station. This is undoubtedly cool, but he misses him.

A family drama fused with a science thriller, this is another gripping story from Christopher Edge. In his previous novel, [<cite>The Many Worlds of Albie Bright</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1887960), a teenage boy travels through multiple universes in the hope of finding his deceased mother alive.

### [<cite>Tally and Squill in a Sticky Situation</cite>, by Abie Longstaff & James Brown](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1983725)

Orphan Tally (real name Tallulah), a servant at Mollett Manor, uses her wits to solve a cunning burglary. The book was originally called <cite>The Secret Library</cite> and much of the action takes place around ancient tomes. It’s an exciting start to a new illustrated mystery series for 8-10 year-olds.

James Brown’s black and white drawings are a delight and add greatly to the sense of place. I just wish the typeface were a little bigger.

### [<cite>The Moonlight Statue</cite>, by Holly Webb](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2094655)

> "As soon as she moves to Penhallow Place, Poppy can't wait to unravel its mysteries. One night, she sleepwalks outside and wakes to find her hand on the stone statue of a dog. The dog introduces himself as Rex, an Irish Wolfhound, who lived at Penhallow many hundreds of years earlier. And he is not the only resident ghost."

<cite>The Hounds of Penhallow Hall</cite> is a new mystery series from the ace storyteller Holly Webb. There’s more than a touch of <cite>Ghost</cite> about it too.

### [<cite>The Mystery of the Painted Dragon</cite>, by Katherine Woodfine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100203)

London in 1909 is the setting for this third book in the thrilling <cite>Sinclair’s Mysteries</cite>, period sleuthing adventures with exciting plots and feisty characters. My heart was in my mouth as I read the first chapter, from the moment the heroine realises she is being followed to her fall onto the rails of an underground station. Can’t wait to read more...

## Junior Non-fiction

### [<cite>Nature</cite>, by Clare Beaton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2141455)

> "Whether it's wandering in woodlands or watching wildlife, being outdoors in nature is a favourite activity for children. Clare Beaton shares her passion for the world around us and suggests creative nature crafts for adults and children to enjoy together. This is the book that brings nature to your door!"

A nicely produced, achievable craft book for children.

### [<cite>Champions League Fact File</cite>, by Clive Gifford](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2114623)

> "Become an expert on the UEFA Champions League! Read all about the tournament's top teams and record-breaking players, get the lowdown on the European Cup, and discover the legendary matches that have made the UEFA Champions League the world's greatest annual football tournament."

### [<cite>The Street Beneath My Feet</cite>, by Charlotte Gullian & Yural Zommer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2111450)

> "When you're walking along the city streets there's always so much to see and hear. But do you ever stop and look down? Have you ever wondered what's going on deep in the ground under your feet? What about in the countryside? What goes on underground there? Starting in the city, take a journey down though the layers of the Earth, all the way to the planet's core and out the other side. There are so many amazing sights to see along the way!"

Be very careful if you borrow this title, because it has a concertina format, but it’s such a useful book, we couldn’t resist.

### [<cite>The Story of London picture book</cite>, by Rob Lloyd Jones](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2122988)

> "Follow the story of London as it grew from the Roman town of Londinium, survived the plagues and fires of the 17th century, witnessed Victorian innovations, was bombed during The Blitz, and has become one of the busiest, richest cities in the world."

Features brief, well presented facts.

### [<cite>Coding for Beginners: using Python</cite>, by Louie Stowell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2122964)

> "An introduction to coding for complete beginners, this friendly and accessible book will teach children the basics of Python (a widely used programming language), allowing them to get inside the code of their computer and create simple games and animations on screen."

### [<cite>What's Where On Earth Atlas: the world as you've never seen it before</cite>, by DK](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2110672)

> "<cite>What's Where On Earth Atlas</cite> is like no other atlas you have ever seen. With its specially commissioned 3D maps and artworks, it will take you on a continent-by-continent tour of the world. With themed maps for each continent, on topics such as major geographical features, cities and monuments, population and wildlife, explore the world in incredible detail."

A stunning new atlas aimed at KS2.
