He's big and sunburned, and he doesn't seem to be as engaged as he once was. It's easier to play outside in the wreckage of the bombings than to stay at home with a dad she doesn't know anymore. But when Ruby hurts her knee in the ruins, there's only one person who can rescue her and make her feel all right."

What would it feel like to know the fate of an entire town rested on your shoulders?

> "Twelve-year-old Gran Flowerpetal is about to find out. When Gran's friend, the difficult-to-impress Catalina Catalan, presses a silver handle into a hillside and opens a doorway to underground, he knows that she is extraordinary and brave, and that he will have no choice but to follow her, and help her save the town (and the known world).

Fed up, her mother bundles her daughters into the car and drives to her husband's Cambridge college to collect him herself.

> "But when they arrive, the staff claim that nobody by his name has ever worked there. Kay is puzzled by her mother's reaction - silent tears, not anger and confusion. And what is even more puzzling is the card on her pillow when they return home: Will O. de Wisp, Gent. F.H.S.P. and Phillip R.T. Gibbet, Gent. F.H.S.P. K.Bith. REMOVALS. That night, Kay is woken by voices at her window: the voices of Will and Phillip, the Removers. But they are not human. And Kay shouldn't be able to see them. Except she can!"

Publisher Puffin describes this as the kind of book that "every editor dreams of discovering; the kind that gives you goosebumps from the off because the writing, characters and setting are all so vivid."

In fact, a whole lot of them out there don't identify with the idea of being a strong, independent, competitive saviour who never cries. As a boy, there is an assumption that you will conform to this stereotypical idea of masculinity, but what if you're the introvert kind, what if you prefer to pick up a book rather than a sword, what if you're very sensitive, what if you like the idea of wearing a dress?"
