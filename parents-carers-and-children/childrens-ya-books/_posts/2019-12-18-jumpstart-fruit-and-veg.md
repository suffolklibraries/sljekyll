> "Do you think vegetables are yucky? Just wait until you see what Monty the Monster has on his plate!

This delightfully funny book will have parents and children giggling together as they find their favourite animals eating the silliest meals."

## [<cite>Give Peas a Chance</cite>, by Rob Biddulph](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2501661)

> "Meet Nancy, Otto, Winnie and all the other dinosaur juniors, as they traverse life's first ups and downs - all in Rob's trademark rhyme filled with warmth and humour."

## [<cite>That Fruit is Mine!</cite>, by Anuska Allepuz](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2534508)

> "Five goofy, greedy elephants are up against five teeny-tiny mice in this picture book parable for modern times. One day, deep in the jungle, five elephants discover a new tree - a tall tree - and, atop that tree, the most mouth-wateringly delicious fruit any of them had ever seen. 'MINE!' each elephant cries. 'Mine, mine, mine, mine, MINE!' But who will get there first? And will the elephants spot the five tiny mice, planning and plotting, slowly approaching that tip-top branch?"

## [<cite>Fruits in Suits</cite>, by Jared Chapman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2338252)

> "It's time to go swimming, and everyone has a different swimming suit: one pieces, two pieces, old-fashioned ones, suits for babies and parents... But Dad's business suit just won't do at all.

> "The pear likes a one-piece suit, while Pineapple wants to grab attention with a futuristic costume and hi-vis goggles. They all prefer different activities, too. One of the grapes is partial to a scuba dive, while Strawberry would rather bask in the shade with a big floppy hat and get stuck into a good book."

> "Lee is a pea. All of his friends are peas; except Colin. Colin isn't a pea.

> "And so begins the deliciously funny story of two very different friends: a small green pea and a tall orange carrot stick. Colin the carrot can't do everything the peas can, but he has some special carrot-y qualities that make him a very good friend to have."

## [<cite>Gary's Banana Drama</cite>, by Jane Massey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2361853)

> "Gary is desperate for a banana. Could that be one poking over the wall? No! It’s a fancy lady’s hat! Is that a banana whizzing through the air? OUCH! NO! It’s a boomerang from Billy’s show! Where ARE all the bananas? Alone and hungry, Gary is about to give up until... WAIT! Could it be... the BIGGEST BANANA IN THE WORLD?"

## [<cite>Kitchen Disco</cite>, by Clare Forges & Al Murphy](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1802860)

## [<cite>Avocado Baby</cite>, by John Burningham](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1917401)
