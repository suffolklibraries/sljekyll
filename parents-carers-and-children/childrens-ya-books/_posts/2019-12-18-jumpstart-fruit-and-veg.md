> "Meet Nancy, Otto, Winnie and all the other dinosaur juniors, as they traverse life's first ups and downs - all in Rob's trademark rhyme filled with warmth and humour."

> "Five goofy, greedy elephants are up against five teeny-tiny mice in this picture book parable for modern times. One day, deep in the jungle, five elephants discover a new tree - a tall tree - and, atop that tree, the most mouth-wateringly delicious fruit any of them had ever seen. 'MINE!' each elephant cries. 'Mine, mine, mine, mine, MINE!' But who will get there first? And will the elephants spot the five tiny mice, planning and plotting, slowly approaching that tip-top branch?"
