Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>I Killed Father Christmas</cite>, by Anthony McGowan & Chris Riddell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2184701).

![I Killed Father Christmas](/images/featured/featured-i-killed-father-christmas.jpg)

A new title from Barrington Stoke, optimised for readers with dyslexia and visual stress and enjoyable by all.

> "Jo-Jo's mum and dad are arguing again - but this time it's on Christmas Eve and Jo-Jo's convinced it's all his fault. He's been spoiled, selfish and greedy - and his badness has actually killed Father Christmas.

> "To make amends, Jo-Jo decides that he must be Father Christmas - and so he fills sacks with his old toys and puts on mum's long red coat. But then a magical encounter with the real Father Christmas shows Jo-Jo that the true message of Christmas is the giving of love, not of gifts."
