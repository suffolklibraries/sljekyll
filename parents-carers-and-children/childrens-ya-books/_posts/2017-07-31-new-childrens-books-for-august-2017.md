## Board books

### [<cite>Mummy, Baby</cite>, by Beth Harwood & Emma Dodd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185051)

From the Amazing Baby series is this simple board book for the very young.

> "The tabs slide to reveal a parent animal - cat, dog - on one side, with babies - kittens, puppies - on the other side."

### [<cite>Spot goes to the Fire Station</cite>, by Eric Hill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186704)

With the double draw of Spot and a fire station, this new board book will prove very popular:

> "Spot knows just what he wants to be when he grows up - a fireman, just like his grandpa. When he visits Grandpa at the fire station, cheeky Spot slides down the pole, climbs the ladder, soaks Grandpa with the hose and finally sounds the noisy siren. Spot thinks he's a very good fireman, but perhaps Grandpa is not so sure!"

## Picture books

We can’t wait to see inside this latest exciting title in the Ten Little series, because if the cover is anything to go by, it will be hilarious. Brownlow’s rhyming texts simply roll his plots along with joyous humour ,and as for Simon Rickerty’s illustrations, they are endearing, charming, inclusive, appealing and we LOVE them!

### [<cite>Big Box Little Box</cite>, by Caryl Hart & Edward Underwood](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186826)

> "How many ways can a cat interact with a box? This cat will entrance young readers as it investigates every box it can - and makes a mouse friend along the way. With bright, bold illustrations from Edward Underwood, this is a striking and witty book for children and adults alike."

### [<cite>School for Little Monsters</cite>, by Michelle Robinson & Sarah Horne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186131)

This madcap tale is perfect for little monsters everywhere!"

## Beginner reads

This book, in the Usborne First Reading (Level 1) series, has been especially adapted from Kipling’s <cite>Just So Stories</cite>, for children who are beginning readers. It is a hardback, so it feels like a “proper” book. It’s packed full of illustrations to add interest and aid understanding.

### [<cite>The Princess and the Pea</cite>, by Matthew Oldham & Lorena Alvarez](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185699)

Another super little hardback retelling of a traditional tale that Usborne do so well. I love the cover illustration of all those mattresses – hope the prince has brought a ladder!
