<cite>There is a Tribe of Kids</cite>, by Lane Smith, won the prestigious [CILIP Greenaway](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/kate-greenaway-longlist/) for an outstandingly illustrated book for children and young people. Stock librarian Sophie gives her verdict.

**[See <cite>There is a Tribe of Kids</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2129717)**

> "When a young boy embarks on a journey alone ... he trails a colony of penguins, undulates in a smack of jellyfish, clasps hands with a constellation of stars, naps for a night in a bed of clams, and follows a trail of shells, home to his tribe of friends."

There is definitely a tribal feel to this journey through collective nouns as we follow a child who is looking for the group where he belongs. The sponge-printed illustrations are lovely, flowing in patterns across the pages and giving this book a wild and natural feel. In an interesting reversal, the story is told completely in pictures and the few words describe the scenes.

## Other titles written and illustrated by Lane Smith

### [<cite>Pinnochio, the Boy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=285037)

> "This is the story of Pinocchio after he has been turned into a boy by the Blue Fairy. The trouble is, she changes him while he is asleep and when he wakes up he thinks he is still a puppet. Lane Smith takes the much-loved story of Pinnochio a stage further, into the surreal."

### [<cite>A Perfect Day</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100272)

> "A warm, funny picture book about a group of animals and their (not so) perfect day in the garden. Whether basking in the warmth of the sun, nibbling on a fresh yellow corn-on-the-cob, or cooling off in a clear pool of water, it is a truly beautiful afternoon for all - what could possibly go wrong?"

### [<cite>Grandpa Green</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=286338)

> "Grandpa Green wasn't always a gardener. He was a boy who lived on a farm and a child who had chickenpox. He was a soldier, a husband, and most of all, an artist. Follow his grandson through a garden where memories are handed down through the shapes of topiary trees and imagination recreates things forgotten."

### [<cite>It's a Book</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=285202)

> "A wry exchange between an IT-savvy donkey, a book-loving ape and a mouse forms this playful and lighthearted examination of print as a medium in the digital age. With a subversive and signature Lane Smith twist, this picture book has something to say about the importance of reading to children and adults alike."

### [<cite>The Stinky Cheese Man and other fairly stupid tales</cite>, by Jon Scieszka](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=28109)

> "A look at some almost fairy tales, including 'Chicken Licken', 'The Really Ugly Duckling', and 'Little Red Running Shorts'."
