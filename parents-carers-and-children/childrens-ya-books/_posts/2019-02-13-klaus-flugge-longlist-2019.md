> "Some of us like the comfort of familiarity - staying close to the home we've always known, making a life, building a community. For some, the intimacy of the old routine is satisfaction itself. But the known is not for everyone.

> "When our five protagonists get to wondering what's on the other side of their island, they can't stop until they find out. What follows is an epic journey of discovery, danger, imagination, and ultimately, bittersweet fulfilment. Is this sophisticated picture book about man versus earth? Man versus man? Or man versus self? Like our protagonists, every reader will find their own right answer in this haunting and deceptively simple modern fable."
