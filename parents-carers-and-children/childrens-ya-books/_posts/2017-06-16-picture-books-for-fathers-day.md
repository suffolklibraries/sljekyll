> "Your baby's first word will be 'Dada!' Right? Everyone knows that fathers wage a secret campaign to ensure that their babies' first word is 'Dada!' But how does it work?

## [<cite>Alfie and Dad</cite>, by Shirley Hughes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2137318)

> "Alfie's dad is always there for Alfie and Annie Rose. He's there to reassure Alfie during a restless night; he's there to find Alfie's favourite toy Flumbo when he gets left on the bus; and most of all he loves spending time with his children and they love spending time with him!"

## [<cite>Things to do with Dad</cite>, by Sam Zuppardi](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2140404)

> "A morning of fun with Dad takes a turn for the boring when a long to-do list interferes. At first content to let Dad cross things off his list, the boy in the story soon realises that the whole day will be spent on chores - unless he can come up with a solution.

> "In his singularly playful and expressive style, author-illustrator Sam Zuppardi crafts a colourful celebration of fathers and sons, and the fun that can be had with just a little imagination - and a trusty green crayon."
