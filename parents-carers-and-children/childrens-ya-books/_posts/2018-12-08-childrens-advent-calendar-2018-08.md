Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>We're Going on an Elf Chase</cite>, by Martha Mumford & Laura Hughes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2417706).

> "Four bunnies set off on a jolly Christmas lift-the-flap adventure to find ten little elves hidden under the flaps. You'll have to run, run, run if you're going to catch them all! And there are lots of obstacles along the way, from clippy-cloppy reindeer to roaring polar bears and flippy-flappy penguins."
