> "In this beautifully illustrated hide-and-seek series, children can 'spot' the animal through a hole on each page - but when they turn the page it isn't them at all! Very young children will love searching for the elusive animal, and all the charming details and other animals they discover along the way."

Jeffers' latest book is inspired by his baby boy's fascination with the world:

> "Our world can be a bewildering place, especially if you've only just got here. Your head will be filled with questions, so let's explore what makes our planet and how we live on it. From land and sky, to people and time, these notes can be your guide and start you on your journey. And you'll figure lots of things out for yourself. Just remember to leave notes for everyone else. Some things about our planet are pretty complicated, but things can be simple, too: you've just got to be kind."

She's got judo, swimming, yoga, painting, rugby, and biking to do! She does not have a minute to herself, and she can't be late!

> "But one particularly jam-packed morning, Boomer accidentally keeps the girl from getting out the door. Instead of panicking, she decides to take the day at Boomer's pace for once. They spend the afternoon exploring the garden, and the girl is reminded how nice it is to take time to appreciate life's simple pleasures every once in a while."

According to Publishers Weekly, "the story's slowing pace and emphasis on observation remind children (and their parents) that relaxing means letting go to watch and listen."
