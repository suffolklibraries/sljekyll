> "The Elephant takes the Bad Baby for a ride and they go 'rumpeta, rumpeta, rumpeta down the road.'

All ends well as the Bad Baby learns to say 'Please' and his mother makes pancakes for everyone."

### [<cite>The Story of Babar: the little elephant</cite>, by Jean de Brunhoff](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=651651)

### [<cite>Elephant</cite>, by Petr Horacek](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=373446)

> "A young boy spends his day playing games with his imaginary friend, the Elephant. Real or not, when Grandma and Grandpa are busy, the Elephant proves to be the perfect playmate."

Very young children will love searching for the elusive elephant, and all the charming details and other animals they discover along the way."

### [<cite>When an Elephant Falls in Love</cite>, by Davide CalÃ¬ & ALice Lotti](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2088959)

> "This soulful book is at once relatable and revealing, a reminder that love is worth striving for and that the very best things in life will come to those who wait."
