Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>Top Elf</cite>, by Caleb Zane Huett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2261267).

> "Ollie and Celia think they know what the life of an elf is supposed to be like: Make toys. Help Santa. Make more toys. Help Santa. Try out a new ice-cream flavour. Help Santa.

> "But then Santa rocks the North Pole with a surprise announcement! He's decided this is going to be his last year in the Big Red Suit - and instead of letting his oldest son, the unfortunately named Klaus Claus, take over, he's opening up the job to any kid who wants to apply - Claus or elf. The Santa Trials have begun!

> "Ollie and Celia enter the contest, having no idea whatsoever that they'll soon have to squeeze through impossible chimneys, race runaway sleighs, sweet-talk a squad of rowdy reindeer, and consume cruel amounts of cookies and milk. It's both an adventure and a survival test, far beyond what any elf or Claus has been asked to do before. But whoever rises to the top will get a reward even bigger than Christmas."
