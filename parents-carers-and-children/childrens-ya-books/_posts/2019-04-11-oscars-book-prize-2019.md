> "Ruby loves being Ruby. Until, one day, she finds a worry. at first it’s not such a big worry, and that’s alright, but then it starts to grow. It gets bigger and bigger every day and it makes Ruby sad. How can Ruby get rid of her worry and feel like herself again?"

> "Move over, Bonnie and Clyde, because there's a new criminal mastermind in town: Baby Frank! Baby Frank's parents say that he can't have a pet - 'Pets are for older kids', 'Be happy with your teddy', 'They cost too much to keep' - which leaves Baby Frank with a BIG problem because he REALLY wants a pet. What's a baby to do? Rob a bank, of course! But will money buy Baby Frank the fluffy pet he so desperately wants?"
