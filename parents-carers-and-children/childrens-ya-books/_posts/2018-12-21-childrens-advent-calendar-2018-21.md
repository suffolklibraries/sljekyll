Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>Are You There Little Reindeer?</cite>, by Sam Taplin & Essi Kimpimäki](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2442744).

> "Little children will love trying to find the elusive reindeer as they explore this enchanting board book. Die-cut holes in the pages create a series of surprising transformations, as they think they've found the reindeer - only to discover when they turn the page that it's something else. At the end, of course, they really do find it."
