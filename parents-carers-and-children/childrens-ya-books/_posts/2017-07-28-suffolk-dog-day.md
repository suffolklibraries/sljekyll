The tenth annual [Suffolk Dog Day](http://www.suffolkdogday.com/) takes place at Helmingham Hall on Sunday 30 July. To mark this celebration of the county's canine friends of all shapes and sizes, we've put together a list of our favourite dog-related children's books.

## Board books

> "Frog is changing the rules - dogs no longer sit on frogs. Phew! Dogs now sit on logs - and everyone else is going to have to sit somewhere different too. Will cats want to sit on gnats? Will spiders like sitting on gliders? Will whales be happy to sit on nails? And, most importantly, where is FROG going to sit?"
