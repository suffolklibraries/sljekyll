> "A lonely young snowball, stuck at the top of a mountain, decides to visit the local town for a bit of fun - but on his way he trips, falls, and starts to roll - and when a snowball rolls through snow, we all know what happens!

> "This snowball picks up not only snow, but a myriad of other crazy things on his way down - a sheep, a line of washing and even a bear on a bike."
