In this peep-through spin-off to the 'That's Not My ...' series:

> "Zebra wishes she wasn't black and white. Follow her in this colourful board book, as she meets a pink flamingo, a green crocodile, an orange giraffe and a blue parrot and imagines what it would be like if her stripes were the same colour as them. Peep through the holes in the pages to see what Zebra looks like as her stripes change colour."

Children can read about Ned's bedtime routine and follow Millie and Mo's potty-training journey.

### [<cite>All Aboard the Toilet Train!: a noisy Bing book</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2334971)

### [<cite>Hello Zoo</cite>, by Nicola Slater](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2352885)

## Picture books

> "Cake has been invited to a party. He's very excited! He's never been to a birthday party before and he doesn't know what to expect. But as the candles on his party hat begin to burn and the other guests start to sing, Cake starts to think that this is one party he'd rather not be at."

This looks to be another darkly hilarious hit from the team behind [<cite>Supertato</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2349536).

### [<cite>How to Eat Pizza</cite>, by Jon Burgerman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2342604)

The pizza in this book definitely does NOT want to be eaten. Another comic offering from the author of [<cite>Rhyme Crime</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2193700).

### [<cite>The New Neighbours</cite>, by Sarah McIntyre](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2336953)

> "When new neighbours move in to the tower block, what will the other residents of Pickle Rye think? Find out in this hilarious and light-hearted book that is bursting with wonderful characters and humour. Giggle away as you hop, trot and totter down the stairs to share news of the new neighbours and learn just how important it is to leave judgements and prejudices far behind."

Many of the characters from [<cite>Vern and Lettuce</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1425216) star in this new title from inspirational BookTrust illustrator-in-residence McIntyre. She hopes it will get children thinking about 'prejudice [and] jumping to conclusions about people before they've met them or tried to get to know them.'

### [<cite>The Knight Who Said 'No!'</cite>, by Lucy Rowland & Kate Hindley](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2352883)

> "Ned the knight always does exactly what he's told. When his parents ask him to pick up his toys, dig up the cabbages or go to bed on time, he does it all with a smile. And when the dragon swoops into town every night, he always runs inside just as he's asked.

> "But one morning, instead of saying, "yes," he says, "NO!" He will NOT help his dad find his shield, his arrow or his bow, and he will certainly NOT let the butcher go past. That night, he refuses to go inside, and in doing so he confronts the dragon, making a very unlikely friend."

This is on the recommended list for the 2018 Mischief Makers Summer Reading Challenge.

Life is tough: he's so afraid of heights, he can't even bear to climb onto his bed, or reach his favourite cereal on the top shelf at the supermarket. But one day, fuelled by his passion for bird-watching, he decides to conquer his fears and something amazing happens."

### [<cite>Splish, Splash, Ducky!</cite>, by Lucy Cousins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2334681)

> "Ducky Duckling loves playing outside in the rain. He hops with frog, squirms with wriggly worm and splashes with the fishes. But when the rain stops, Ducky feels sad. Can Daddy help cheer him up?"

### [<cite>A Bear is a Bear (except when he's not)</cite>, by Karl Newson & Anuska Allepuza](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2336144)

> "When one sleepy bear wakes up early from his winter sleep, he's confused. Is he a bird? Or a moose? A fox perhaps? Or even a squirrel? No! He's definitely a bear, and it's time this bear went back to sleep."

### [<cite>Almost Anything</cite>, by Sophy Henn](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2336036)

> "George can't roller-skate, George can't paint, and George most certainly can't dance. But Bear thinks that, with a little help, George can do all these things - and more. And, luckily for George, Bear has just a little magic to help."

> "It's decision time for Fergus and the rest of the squad. Training together has been going well but the International Championships are nearly here, and it's time to name the four riders who will be in the starting line-up. The coaches decide the only fair thing to do is hold official trials to decide who's in - and who's out. It's neck and neck for Fergus and Daisy after the Keirin and the road race - and with just one race to go, tensions in the team are riding high."

The second in this laugh-out-load series by the radio DJs. Their first book, [<cite>Kid Normal</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2173648), was shortlisted for the Waterstones Children's Book Prize.

But Murph Cooper is making it work: he's a schoolkid by day and a member of the top-secret Heroes' Alliance by night. Not that anyone at The School seems to care. Most of Murph's teachers and classmates still believe that unless you have a proper superpower you can't be a real hero.

### [<cite>Song of the Dolphin Boy</cite>, by Elizabeth Laird & Peter Bailey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2336872)

> "Finn has always been different, and in the tiny fishing village of Stromhead he sticks out like a sore thumb. Always told to keep away from the water, he's felt that something was missing until one day he dives in and finds that, swimming with the dolphins, he feels completely at home.

> "But his new friends are in danger of being injured by the rubbish that floats out into the water - and now a supermarket is going to release thousands of balloons that could drift out to sea and cause even more damage. Desperate to help the dolphins, Finn goes to the Lighthouse Crew, a group of kids who have always left Finn out. Will they be able to set aside their differences to save the dolphins? And what will Finn discover about his past along the way?"

This fictionalised tale of the dangers of discarded plastic to our marine life is very topical in the wake of <cite>Blue Planet 2</cite>.

> "Max is used to spending time alone - it's difficult to make friends in a big, chaotic school when you're deaf. He prefers to give his attention to the little things in life - like making awesome, detailed replica models.

> "Then Mr Darrow, the school caretaker and fellow modeller, goes missing. Max must follow his parting instruction: 'Go to my room. You'll know what to do'. On the floor he finds a pile of sand - and in the sand is Mr Darrow's latest creation - a tiny boy, no bigger than a raisin, Luke, Prince of the Blues. And behind the tiny boy - millions of others - a thriving, bustling, sprawling civilisation!"
