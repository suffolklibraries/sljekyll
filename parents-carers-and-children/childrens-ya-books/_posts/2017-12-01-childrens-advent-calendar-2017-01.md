> "Pilgrim Lee's beautiful illustrations of a classic song provide the perfect holiday read for your child.

> "With a partidge in a pear tree on page one, two turtle doves on page two, and three French hens on page three, Pilgrim Lee's standout artwork, reminiscent of Pat Hutchins, is a beautiful take on the classic Christmas song that has always captivated children during the holiday season."
