> "When the moon rises and the stars twinkle, it is bedtime for the baby animals of the Indian forest. But tonight, when the skies turn dark and the night grows stormy, the little ones can’t sleep. Only Mama Elephant with her words of wisdom can reassure them ‘You’re safe with me’."

## [<cite>Wide Awake</cite>, by Rob Biddulph](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2536826)

## [<cite>The Elephant that Ate the Night</cite>, by Bing Bai & Yuanyuan Shen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2447474)

> "Deep in the Black Mushroom Forest all the baby animals live in fear of the night. Then one day Awu the elephant comes to the forest and eats up the dark nights. At first, all the animals are happy and can't stop playing, but then they all begin to yawn! The animals tell Awu that he must spit out the dark nights because all animals need to sleep."

> "Weaving a journey from lively beginning to gentle end, the 10 minute countdown to bed is at the heart of this enchanting story. But will Twinkle get to bed on time? This beautifully illustrated picture book is the perfect length for sending little ones off to sleep."

## [<cite>Shhh!</cite>, by Barroux](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2430470)

## [<cite>Tickle My Ears</cite>, by Jörg Mühle](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1955124)

> "It's getting late and little rabbit must go to bed. Can you help him?

> "<cite>Tickle My Ears</cite> brings a wonderful new bedtime ritual: clap your hands, plump the pillow, give little rabbit's ears a tickle, stroke his back, pull up the covers and a goodnight kiss. And don't forget to turn out the light: here's the switch!"

## [<cite>Beep Beep Beep Time for Sleep!</cite>, by Claire Freedman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1894957)

> "'Beep, beep, beep!' call the tired machines after a busy day on the building site. Follow their journey through to bedtime in this charming book from author Claire Freedman."

## [<cite>Babies Can Sleep Anywhere</cite>, by Lisa Wheeler & Carolina Buzio](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2292439)

> "What better way to encourage a little one to sleep than with a soothing rhyme and image after image of sleeping animals! This gentle picture book introduces the sleeping habits of many animals - from puppies to whales - and compares them to the sometimes - unusual habits of human babies. In backpacks, on knees, in cradles or trees, sweet babies can sleep anywhere!"

## [<cite>Goodnight Tiger</cite>, by Timothy Knapman & Laura Hughes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1952414)

> "The animals in Emily's jungle wallpaper can't sleep, and they are bellowing and stomping and growling and keeping her awake! 'Go to sleep!' shouts Emily. 'We've tried and tried, but can't!' says the tiger. So Emily climbs into the wallpaper and shows the animals how to get ready for bed. Only baths and lullabies aren't quite the same in the jungle!"
