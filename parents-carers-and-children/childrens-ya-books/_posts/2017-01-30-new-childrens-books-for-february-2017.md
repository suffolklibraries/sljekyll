## Board books

### [<cite>Where's Mr Lion</cite>, by Ingela Arrhenius]()

Peepo books are always good with babies and toddlers. This one has flaps made of brightly coloured felt, and a mirror at the end. There is a companion volume too, for our more discerning customers!

### [<cite>All About Spot</cite>, by Eric Hill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079658)

This Spot-shaped board book is maybe the cutest title to be published in 2017. It is irresistible and I predict there may be tantrums ahead as children learn about "sharing". And as for "taking it back to the library" ... hmmmm!

### [<cite>Good Little Wolf</cite>, by Nadia Shireen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=551792)

> "Once upon a time there was a wolf called Rolf - a good little wolf who liked baking cakes and was always kind to his friends. But real wolves aren't supposed to be good - they're supposed to be BIG and BAD. Can a good little wolf still be a real wolf?"

### [<cite>I'm Big Now!</cite>, by Anthea Simmons &amp; Georgie Birkett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079973)

> "When you are big, you're not the baby any more, but sometimes you want to do the baby things you used to do before! In this funny journey of discovery, one little girl decides to try out being a baby again, but discovers it is more fun being the big sister of the family."

This super picture book deals perfectly with this familiar scenario. It's all in rhyme too and set to become a classic.

### [<cite>Adding at the Circus</cite>, by Hannah Watson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2090088)

There are very few books about counting on written especially for pre-school children so this bright, sturdy book, with sliders for little fingers, is very welcome. The second title <cite>Taking Away in the Garden</cite> is due out in February.

### [<cite>This Bear, That Bear!</cite>, by Sian Wheatcroft](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078944)

> "In this colourful, energetic tale, Little Bear and his dad enjoy a fun day out at the bear parade. Who will Little Bear see at the bear parade? Will it be "this bear, that bear, likes to wear a hat bear?" One thing's for sure - the day will be full of surprises."

## Picture books

### [<cite>The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch</cite>, by Ronda and David Armitage](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080546)

We were delighted to see this classic republished to celebrate its 40th anniversary. It’s about a resourceful couple who overcome adversity and get the last laugh on some marauding seagulls. If you haven’t come across it before, you’re in for a treat. The story is great and the illustrations are brilliant.

One day back in 2008, the Armitages came to Suffolk Libraries, carelessly omitting to bring a picnic basket of delicious food. "Ah well, such is life" we said, in a life imitating art sort of a way...

### [<cite>Who Ate The Cake?</cite>, by Kate Leake](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080548)

Poor long suffering Bob, Freddie’s pet dog, gets blamed for a string of catastrophes. The real culprit is a pelican with a beak like the Tardis. The facial expressions of dog, small boy and pelican are wonderful. Quite a long read, but well worth it if your audience likes mess and slapstick.

## Beginner reads

### [<cite>Let's Go for a Drive!, by Mo Willems</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2036097)

> "Gerald is careful. Piggie is not. Piggie cannot help smiling. Gerald can. Gerald worries so that Piggie does not have to. Gerald and Piggie are best friends. Gerald and Piggie want to hit the road. But the best-laid plans of pigs and elephants often go awry. Once again, Mo Willems creates a hilarious escapade starring the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award-winning duo. 'Let's Go for a Drive!' will have early readers breaking into laughter from the first page."

The Elephant & Piggie books are always a little quirky and off-beat. They have quite a following now. I always read these in Harry Hill's voice!

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>The Firebird</cite>, by Abie Longstaff & Lauren Beard](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079971)

> "Tibben, the Potions Master's apprentice, and his friend Wizz must journey to the Parched Desert to get to the bottom of the mystery fierce hot winds, which are blowing sand all over the Kingdom of Arthwen."

This is the fifth title in the <cite>Magic Potions Shop</cite> series of magical fantasies. It’s filled with illustrations and there’s a bit of an adventure too.

### [<cite>Starstruck</cite>, by Alan MacDonald & David Roberts](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2089001)

Angela Nicely is the heroine of another great series of books for children who have just started to read on their own. She’s usually a bit naughty, which adds to the appeal, as do David Roberts' expressive illustrations.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>The Goldfish Boy</cite>, by Lisa Thompson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2081507)

> "12-year-old Matthew is trapped in his bedroom by crippling OCD, spending most of his time staring out of his window as the inhabitants of Chestnut Close go about their business. Until the day he is the last person to see his next door neighbour's toddler, Teddy, before he goes missing. Matthew must turn detective and unravel the mystery of Teddy's disappearance - with the help of a brilliant cast of supporting characters."

### [<cite>Spy Toys</cite>, by Mark Powers](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2082475)

> "The world's leading toy manufacturer makes playthings for the rich and famous, and every toy they create contains a tiny computerised brain and a unique personality. These toys are seriously awesome! But every so often there's a faulty toy! Dan is a Snugliffic Cuddlestar bear - he should be perfect for hugging. But because of a faulty chip, Dan is so strong he could crush a car. Thrown on to the rejects pile, he meets Arabella, a Loadsasmiles Sunshine Doll, who has a very short temper and is absolutely NOT good with children. Soon Dan, Arabella and Flax (a custom-made police robot rabbit gone AWOL) are recruited by Auntie Roz, the 'M' of the toy world, and together they make up THE SPY TOYS. Their first mission: to protect the prime minister's eight-year-old son from being kidnapped."

Illustrated by Tim Wesson and aimed at 7-11 year-olds, this series already has its own game app, as well as a feature-packed [Spy Toys website](http://www.spytoysbooks.com/).

## Junior non fiction

### [<cite>Lesser Spotted Animals</cite>, by Martin Brown](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2049088)

> "Bison are banned and tigers are taboo. Say goodbye to the gnu, cheerio to the cheetah and poo poo to the panda. The world of lesser spotted animals starts here! Discover the brilliant beasts you never knew you needed to know about - from the numbat to the zorilla and everything in between."

## Young teen novels

### [<cite>Life in a Fishbowl</cite>, by Len Vlahos](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2083324)

> "Jackie's life wasn't perfect, but at least it was normal. That is, until her dad received a terminal cancer diagnosis. Then he went and did what anyone faced with mountains of medical bills and a family to support would do: he sold his life to the highest bidder. Which turned out to be a TV station.

> "Suddenly everyone from psychotic millionaires to cyber-savvy nuns wants a piece of Jackie's family as they become a reality TV sensation. Jackie's life spirals out of control just as her dad's starts to run out, and meanwhile the whole world is tuning in to watch her family fall apart."

## YA

### [<cite>We Come Apart</cite>, by Sarah Crossan & Brian Conaghan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1998151)

> "Jess would never have looked twice at Nicu if her friends hadn't left her in the lurch. Nicu is all big eyes and ill-fitting clothes. He's working on his English but he has to practise with the teachers because no one speaks to him. He's so not her type.

> "Appearances matter to Jess. She's got a lot to hide. Nicu thinks Jess is beautiful. His dad brought Nicu and his mum here for a better life, but now all they talk about is going back home to find Nicu a wife. The last thing he wants is to get married. He wants to get educated, do better, stay here in England. But his dad's fists are the most powerful force in Nicu's life, and in the end, he'll have to do what his dad wants."
