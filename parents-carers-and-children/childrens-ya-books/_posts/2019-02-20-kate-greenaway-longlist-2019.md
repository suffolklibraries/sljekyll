## [<cite>Beyond the Fence</cite>, by Maria Gulemetova](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093959)

## [<cite>Illegal</cite>, illustrated by Giovanni Rigano, britten by Eoin Colfer & Andrew Donkin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2407271)

## [<cite>Mary's Monster: love, madness and how Mary Shelley created Frankenstein</cite>, by Lita Judge](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315487)

> "<cite>Mary's Monster</cite> is the compelling and beautifully illustrated story of Mary Shelley - the original rebel girl. When her fractured bond with her beloved father, and her elopement with the mercurial (and married) poet Percy Bysshe Shelley at the age of 16, led her to Switzerland, few could have imagined the consequence would be such a book. But, in the crucible of societal disapproval and tenuous circumstances, Mary Shelley created Frankenstein, and his monster, forged in the fire of her troubled and tragic life.

> "Part biography, part fantasy and part feminist allegory, <cite>Mary's Monster</cite> is an engrossing take on one remarkable woman. And her monster."

## [<cite>You're Safe with Me</cite>, illustrated by Poonam Mistry, written by Soundar Chitra](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2364064)

## [<cite>Bob's Blue Period</cite>, by Marion Deuchars](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2368115)

> "The year 2018 marks a century since the first women won the vote in the United Kingdom, and this book tells the story of their fight. This is a tale of astounding bravery, ingenuity and strength. David’s conversational style is accessible and his artwork full of rich detail, bringing to life the many vivid characters of the Suffragette movement - from the militant activist and wheelchair user Rosa May Billinghurst to the world-famous Emmeline Pankhurst."

## [<cite>This Zoo is Not for You</cite>, by Ross Collins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2357895)

> "When a platypus visits the zoo, the animals all assume he has come about the vacancy and he is swiftly taken through a rigorous interview process. But the platypus is far too bland for the chameleons and not nearly graceful enough for the flamingos.

> "So, he leaves. The animals soon regret being so unkind, but - what's this? The platypus has left an invitation! It seems he had actually come to the zoo to invite them all to his party."

## [<cite>Mrs Noah's Pockets</cite>, illustrated by James Mayhew, written by Jackie Morris](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2183977)

> "When Mr Noah builds the ark, he makes two lists - one for all the animals who will come on board and one for those troublesome creatures he will leave behind. Meanwhile, Mrs Noah gets out her sewing machine and makes a coat with very deep pockets. Lots of pockets."

## [<cite>The Lost Words: a spell book</cite>, illustrated by Jackie Morris, written by Robert Macfarlane](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2257444)

> "All over the country, there are words disappearing from children's lives. These are the words of the natural world - Dandelion, Otter, Bramble and Acorn, all gone. The rich landscape of wild imagination and wild play is rapidly fading from our children's minds. <cite>The Lost Words</cite> stands against the disappearance of wild childhood. It is a joyful celebration of nature words and the natural world they invoke."

<cite>The Lost Words</cite> is also longlisted for the [2019 Carnegie Medal](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/carnegie-longlist-2019/).

> "Finn lives by the sea and the sea lives by him. Every time he looks out his window it's a constant reminder of the stories his grandfather told him about the place where the ocean meets the sky. Where whales and jellyfish soar and birds and castles float.

> "Finn's grandfather is gone now but Finn knows the perfect way to honour him. He'll build his own ship and sail out to find this magical place himself! And when he arrives, maybe, just maybe, he'll find something he didn't know he was looking for."

## [<cite>If All the World Were...</cite>, illustrated by Allison Colpoys, witten by Joseph Coelho](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2488685)

> "A moving, lyrical picture book about a young girl’s love for her granddad and how she copes when he dies, written by poet and playwright Joseph Coelho. This powerful and ultimately uplifting text is the ideal way to introduce children to the concept of death and dying, particularly children who have lost a grandparent."

## [<cite>Norse Myths: tales of Odin, Thor and Loki</cite>, illustrated by Jeffrey Alan Love, written by Kevin Crossley-Holland](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2264550)

> "When a woeful mouse is swallowed up by a wolf, he quickly learns he is not alone: a duck has already set up digs and, boy, has that duck got it figured out! Turns out it's pretty nice inside the belly of the beast - there's delicious food, elegant table settings and, best of all, dancing. And there's something more: no fear of being eaten by a wolf!"

## [<cite>A Stone for Sascha</cite>, by Aaron Becker](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2395657)

> "This year's summer holiday will be very different for a young girl and her family without Sascha, the beloved family dog, along for the ride. But a walk along the beach to gather cool, polished stones becomes a brilliant turning point in the girl's grief. There, at the edge of a vast ocean beneath an infinite sky, she uncovers, alongside the reader, a profound and joyous truth."

> "When the government refused to allow 3000 child refugees to enter the UK in 2016, Nicola Davies was so angry she wrote a poem. It started a campaign for which artists contributed drawings of chairs, symbolising a seat in a classroom, education, kindness, the hope of a future. The poem has become this book, movingly illustrated by Rebecca Cobb, which should prove a powerful aid for explaining the ongoing refugee crisis to younger readers."

## [<cite>Julian is a Mermaid</cite>, by Jessica Love](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2522486)

> "While riding the subway home with his Nana one day, Julian notices three women spectacularly dressed up. Their hair billows in brilliant hues, their dresses end in fishtails, and their joy fills the train carriage.

> "When Julian gets home, daydreaming of the magic he's seen, all he can think about is dressing up just like the ladies and making his own fabulous mermaid costume. But what will Nana think about the mess he makes - and even more importantly - what will she think about how Julian sees himself?"
