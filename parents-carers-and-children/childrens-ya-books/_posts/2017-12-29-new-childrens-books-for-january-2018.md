### [<cite>The Detective Dog</cite>, by Julia Donaldson & Sara Ogilvie](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2303592)

One of our favourite children's titles is coming out in board book format.

> "But Nell has other talents too. Every Monday she goes to school with Peter and listens to children read. So who better to have on hand when they arrive one morning to discover that the school's books have all disappeared! Who could have taken them? And why? There's only one dog for the job and Detective Dog Nell is ready to sniff out the culprit!"

### [<cite>A Little Paper Caper</cite>, by Oliver Jeffers](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2288926)

Another favourite adapted for very young children to enjoy.

> "There was once a forest where everyone was contentedly going about their business. All was well until the strangest thing suddenly started happening.
