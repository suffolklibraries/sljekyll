## Board books

### [<cite>Farm</cite>, by Stella Baggott](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2122302)

This Usborne board book is bold, bright and cheery with fold out pages of farm animals, plus the odd tractor.

### [<cite>Busy Day</cite>, by Emma Dodd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2110887)

> "What a busy day Dog is having! After waking up, he goes out to the field to chat to one of his friends, Horse. Then he meets the pigs, and they all have fun rolling about in mud. Now Dog needs to clean up, so he joins the ducks in the nearby pond. Splash! After his swim, Dog dries off by running after Cat in a game of chase. They pass their owner Vicky, who is quietly enjoying a picnic on the grass. Soon it is Dog's turn to eat, so he dashes into the kitchen for his dinner. Phew! After such a busy day, no wonder Dog is ready for bed. Goodnight, Dog!"

## Picture books

### [<cite>Superbat</cite>, by Matt Carr](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2112087)

> "Pat the bat decides to be special - a SUPERBAT! But all his bat friends have amazing hearing. All of them can fly. And all bats can find their way in the dark. Pat is starting to think that he will never stand out - until a family of mice see him for what he really is - a HERO!"

### [<cite>The Giant Jumperee</cite> by Julia Donaldson & Helen Oxenbury](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2125249)

A poor little rabbit runs away from his burrow when he hears the shout of the Giant Jumperee. He asks cat to help and so follows a brilliant cumulative tale.

The tale simply rolls along with Donaldson's musicality, and Helen Oxenbury’s animals are full of character. The watercolour landscape looks idyllic. Such stuff as dreams are made of, and the best picture book of the decade.

### [<cite>Mine, Mine, Mine! Said the Porcupine</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2103199)

A story in rhyme about a little boy who tempts a selfish porcupine into sharing his toys, this book is a delight from start to finish. Emma Levey’s illustrations are full of humour, expression and colour. Perfect all round.

### [<cite>Hilda and the Runawau Baby](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093925)

Both an endearingly bonkers story of Hilda, a pig whose quietude is invaded by a runaway pram, and an endearingly bonkers story of a daredevil baby whose curiosity leads him into danger. It’s very unusual, very funny and beautifully produced.

### [<cite>The Bossier Baby</cite>, by Marla Frazee](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2057594)

Written in spoof corporatise, this witty sequel to [<cite>The Boss Baby</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=356630) sees the arrival of a new and more demanding CEO, in the shape of a baby sister. With her black babygro accessorized by a single string of pearls, she is a formidable opponent.

If I knew anyone whose toddler was about to be demoted, I’d buy them this book. So clever, so funny, so true.

### [<cite>Dear Dinosaur</cite>, by Chae Strathie & Nicola O'Byrne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2083318)

> "After a trip to the museum, Max writes a letter to his favourite dinosaur, the mighty T. Rex - and the T. Rex writes back! So begins a very unusual friendship in this interactive picture book with letters and cards to open, and dinosaur facts to discover along the way."

Lots of nice twiddly bits to open up and pore over.

## Beginner reads

### [<cite>Tom's Tooth</cite>, by Sam Hay & Melanie Sharp](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108443)

> "Tom wiggles and jiggles his wobbly tooth until it's out. He's so happy but, at bedtime, he cannot find it. Can his brother and sister help?"

This book has a limited word count, a clear font and a good joke about the tooth fairy. Just right for children who are starting out on their reading journey.

### [<cite>The Sleepy Dinosaur</cite>, by Karen Wallace](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108441)

> "This sleepy dinosaur just cannot find the perfect place to sleep - until he's snuggled up in bed!"

This is a fun story for young dinosaur fans who are beginning to read on their own. The dinosaurs are cute, and the few simple words are repeated.

### [<cite>The Magic Pudding Pot</cite>, by Kay Woodward](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108449)

The traditional tale features a little boy and porridge, whereas this twist on the original features a little girl and sticky toffee pudding. What could possibly go wrong?

It’s a bit tricky for children just starting out, but it's familiar and funny, and they’ll have fun picking out the "Cook little pot, cook".

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>Porridge the Tartan Cat and the Brawsome Bagpipes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2094642)

This is the first of a new series about a tartan cat who lives in a house by Loch Loch with the McFun family. Young readers may need some help because although it is very funny, with loads of illustrations, there are 24 chapters. What about taking turns?

### [<cite>Dory Fantasmagory</cite>, by Abby Hanlon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078278)

> "Meet Dory - an irresistible scamp with a huge imagination. Dory's the youngest in her family, which STINKS because it means everyone's always too busy to play with her. Or worse! They call her too little to join in.

> "Luckily Dory has plenty of friends to keep her company - even if everyone else says they're just imaginary. And Dory has a lot to do: outsmarting the monsters that live in her house, escaping from prison (aka time-out) and exacting revenge on her sister's favourite doll."

### [<cite>Disco!</cite>, by Alan MacDonald](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2110054)

> "Join Bertie as he gets tricked into accompanying Angela Nicely to the school disco, becomes Royston Rich's slave for the day and cooks up a great escape for Gran and her friends on an ultra-dull trip to the seaside!"

This is the latest escapade of Dirty Bertie, the scamp who charms his fans and outwits his enemies.

### [<cite>Georgie the Royal Prince Fairy</cite>, by Daisy Meadows](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108430)

> "Rachel and Kirsty are very excited to attend a special royal weekend organised by the Queen! But when the royal signet ring mysteriously disappears, the girls are in for another fantastic Rainbow Magic adventure! Help Kirsty and Rachel find the royal signet ring before it's too late!"

I can’t believe that we’re actually promoting a Rainbow Magic book, but this title is from their "Early Reader" series which children devour. Can’t be bad?

## Junior novels
