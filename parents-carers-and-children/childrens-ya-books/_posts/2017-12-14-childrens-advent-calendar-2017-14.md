Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>Christmas Dinner of Souls</cite>, by Ross Montgomery](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2264700).

An antidote to too much cheer today - this has been described as 'spooky and bloodthirsty'!

> "It's a dark and lonely Christmas Eve in the dining room of ancient Soul's College. The kitchen boy, 11-year-old Lucas, has helped prepare a highly unusual meal, made with unrecognisable ingredients, cooked by a mysterious chef. And then the guests arrive - and carnage ensues. They are ex-students of Soul's College, and they are all completely demented. They demand bottle after bottle of wine, flinging their cutlery and howling like banshees until - silence. The Dean of Soul's College has arrived, and the evening's ceremonies must begin. For this is the annual meeting of a secret club for those who despise children, warmth, happiness, and above all Christmas."
