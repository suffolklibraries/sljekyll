As the plane crashes into the canopy, Fred is suddenly left without a choice. He and the three other children may be alive, but the jungle is a vast, untamed place. With no hope of rescue, the chance of getting home feels impossibly small. Except, it seems, someone has been there before them."

### [<cite>Mary's Monster: love, madness and how Mary Shelley created Frankenstein</cite>, by Lita Judge](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315487)

> "<cite>Mary’s Monster</cite> is the compelling and beautifully illustrated story of Mary Shelley - the original rebel girl. When her fractured bond with her beloved father, and her elopement with the mercurial (and married) poet Percy Bysshe Shelley at the age of 16, led her to Switzerland, few could have imagined the consequence would be such a book. But, in the crucible of societal disapproval and tenuous circumstances, Mary Shelley created Frankenstein, and his monster, forged in the fire of her troubled and tragic life.

> "Part biography, part fantasy and part feminist allegory, <cite>Mary’s Monster</cite> is an engrossing take on one remarkable woman. And her monster."
