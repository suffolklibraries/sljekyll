> "It's snow joke - it's the coolest time of the year, so why not celebrate with this collection of Christmas crackers from everyone's favourite loser? A festive feast of puns, one-liners, cartoons and funny tales, all with a Barry Loser twist. Perfect for sharing with friends and family and best enjoyed when read very loudly at 5am on Christmas morning."
