> "Doctor Proctor, Nilly, and Lisa try to save the holidays in this fart-tastically funny adventure from <cite>New York Times</cite> bestselling author Jo Nesbø.

> "When the king of Norway sells the rights to Christmas to Mr Thrane, it looks like the holidays aren't going to be very merry. Mr Thrane says that the only people who can celebrate are those who buy 10,000 crowns worth of presents from his department store. For anyone who doesn't - or can't - spend that much, it's no tree, no presents, no carols, and no Christmas pudding.

> "Doctor Proctor, Nilly, and Lisa aren't going to take this sitting down! They're going to find Santa and save Christmas. All they need is a sleigh, flying reindeer, some time travel soap, and, of course, some fart powder!"
