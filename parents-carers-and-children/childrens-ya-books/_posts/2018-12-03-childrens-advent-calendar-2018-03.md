A magical new story inspired by Raymond Briggs' festive classic.

> "When James wakes to see snow falling one December morning, he is delighted and rushes outside to make a snowman. With coal eyes, an old green hat and scarf and a tangerine nose, he is perfect and James can hardly bear to go inside and leave him. In the middle of the night, he wakes and creeps out to see his snowman again - and to his amazement, the snowman comes to life!"
