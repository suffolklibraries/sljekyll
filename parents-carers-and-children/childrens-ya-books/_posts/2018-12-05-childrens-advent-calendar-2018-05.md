Companion to the Father Christmas series.

> "From number one bestselling author Matt Haig comes a hilarious and heartwarming story, brilliantly illustrated throughout by Chris Mould. Wherever she is, whatever the day, she only has one kind of thing to say. Just as cats go miaow and cows go moo, the Truth Pixie can only say things that are true."
