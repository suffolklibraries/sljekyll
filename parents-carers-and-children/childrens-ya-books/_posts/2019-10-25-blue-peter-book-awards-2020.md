## Best Story

### [<cite>Bloom</cite>, by Nicola Skinner & Flavia Sorrentino](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2534475)

> "Sorrel Fallowfield is so good at being good that teachers come to her when they need help remembering the school rules – and there are LOTS.

> "Luckily, Sorrel doesn’t have any trouble following them, until the day she discovers a faded packet of Surprising Seeds buried under a tree in her backyard.

> "Now she’s hearing voices, seeing things, experiencing an almost unstoppable urge to plant the Seeds in some very unusual places… and completely failing to win her school’s competition to find The Most Obedient Child of the School.

> "And all that’s before flowers start growing out of her head..."

### [<cite>Can You See Me?</cite>, by Libby Scott & Rebecca Westcott](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2556122)

> "People think that because Tally's autistic, she doesn't realise what they're thinking, but Tally sees and hears - and notices - all of it. Endearing, insightful and warmly uplifting, this is a story of autism, empathy and kindness that will touch readers of all ages."

### [<cite>Charlie Changes into a Chicken</cite>, by Sam Copeland & Sarah Horne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2504385)

> "Charlie McGuffin tries to be an optimist, but in reality he’s a bit of a worrier. Some of the things Charlie is worried about: his brother (who is in hospital); their very panicked parents; unwanted attention from the school bully; the fact that he’s started turning into animals!

> "Even though every kid wants a superhero power, Charlie isn’t keen on turning into a pigeon in the middle of the school play. But what happens if he does?"

### [<cite>Lori and Max</cite>, by Catherine O'Flynn](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2610310)

> "Max is the new girl at school and Lori is asked to look after her. Max is odd. She doesn't fit in - but then Lori doesn't really fit in either. When some charity money goes missing and Max disappears, Lori seems to be the only one who doesn't think Max has stolen it and run away."

### [<cite>Malamander</cite>, by Thomas Taylor](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2549493)

> "Nobody visits Eerie-on-Sea in the winter. Especially not when darkness falls and the wind howls around Maw Rocks and the wreck of the battleship Leviathan, where even now some swear they have seen the unctuous Malamander creep.

> "Herbert Lemon, Lost-and-Founder at the Grand Nautilus Hotel, knows that returning lost things to their rightful owners is not easy - especially when the lost thing is not a thing at all, but a girl. No one knows what happened to Violet Parma's parents 12 years ago, and when she engages Herbie to help her find them, the pair discover that their disappearance might have something to do with the legendary sea-monster, the Malamander.

> "Eerie-on-Sea has always been a mysteriously chilling place, where strange stories seem to wash up. And it just got stranger!"

### [<cite>Owen and the Soldier</cite>, by Lisa Thompson & Mike Lowery](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2561296)

> "A crumbling stone soldier sits on a bench in the park. Only Owen understands how important he is.

> "At home, Owen and his mum are struggling and there’s nobody he can talk to. Hidden away in the park, Owen feels free to be himself. When the war-weary soldier is listening, his worries slip away. But nobody else cares about the soldier, and the town council want to tear him down. Owen’s the only one who can save him but can he find the courage to speak up before it’s too late?"

### [<cite>Runaway Robot</cite>, by Frank Cottrell-Boyce & Steven Lenton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2546368)

> "Alfie is off school after an accident in which he lost both his hand and his confidence. He's lonely all day on his own.

But a ban on humanoid robots has just been passed, which means Alfie is breaking the law by sheltering Eric. Can he keep his new friend safe - and himself - out of trouble?"

### [<cite>Vote for Effie</cite>, by Laura Wood](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2427134)

> "Join Effie Kostas as she fights to become Student Council President in her new school. With a campaign team of loveable misfits, she tackles the truly important subjects: gender imbalance, outdated school conventions - and good-looking boys stealing the last slice of chocolate cake at lunchtime."

### [<cite>Where the River Runs Gold</cite>, by Sita Brahmachari](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2552687)

> "Shifa and her brother, Themba, live in Kairos City with their father, Nabil. The few live in luxury, whilst the millions like them crowd together in compounds, surviving on meagre rations and governed by Freedom Fields - the organisation that looks after you, as long as you opt in.

> "The bees have long disappeared; instead children must labour on farms, pollinating crops so that the nation can eat. The farm Shifa and Themba are sent to is hard and cruel. Themba won't survive there and Shifa comes up with a plan to break them out. But they have no idea where they are - their only guide is a map drawn from the ramblings of a stranger.

> "The journey ahead is fraught with danger, but Shifa is strong and knows to listen to her instincts - to let love guide them home. The freedom of a nation depends on it..."

### [<cite>Wildspark</cite>, by Vashti Hardy](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2556121)

> "In Medlock, a secretive guild of inventors have brought spirits of the dead back into the world, harnessing them in animal-like machines.

To find him, she needs to get the ghost machines to remember the people they used to be."
