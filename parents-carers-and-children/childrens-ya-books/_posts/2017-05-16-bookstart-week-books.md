This year, National Bookstart Week runs from 5-11 June and the theme is 'Let's Explore Outdoors'. Why not reserve some books from their outdoor-themed book list?

Our libraries will also be holding special events during the week, where pre-schoolers and their parents/carers can listen to stories, take part in outdoor-themed activities and pick up free books. See [your local library's page](/libraries/) or contact them to find out what they have planned.
