WHSmith's Tom Fletcher Book Club aims to get children excited about reading with brilliant books. Why not try one of their highly-recommended titles?

## [<cite>The Unlikely Adventures of Mabel Jones</cite>, by Will Mabbitt & Ross Collins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1763050)

> "When Mabel Jones unknowingly commits 'The Deed' she finds herself swiftly bundled into a sack and carried off to the pirate ship the Feroshus Maggot. Crewed by the strangest bunch of pirates you would ever want to meet and captained by the dreaded Idryss Ebeneezer Split (a wolf with a false leg carved from a human thighbone, a rusty cutlass sheathed in his belt and a loaded pistol tucked in his pants with no fear of the consequences), the Feroshus Maggot whisks Mabel Jones off on the adventure of a lifetime."

> "11-year-old Zach has magical powers, just like everyone in his family, but he's having trouble harnessing his abilities. To help his powers manifest, and to help him appreciate his natural gifts, Zach's parents decide that he needs to be around 'real' people more. No more homeschooling - it's time for Zach to enter the scary world of secondary school!

> "But Zach can't resist a bit of magic. A simple spell ends with him and his best friend stuck in a vending machine. Someone filmed it and by the next day he's gone viral on YouTube, in the process attracting the attention of Rachel, the prettiest girl at school.

> "With everyone wondering how Zach does his tricks, and with head mean girl Tricia plotting to bring him down, Zach's got his work cut out if he's going to survive year 7 and keep his dreams of becoming a master magician intact."

That's a new home, a fortune and a lifetime's supply of treats rolled into one!

With the help of his new friends Fliss and Billy, Archie has to try to figure out the puzzles of Honeystone before his sweet future melts away like an ice lolly in the sun!"

He's going to have to think outside the box, (the pizza box), if he's going to become the hero he's always dreamed of. If he's going to make Iguana Boy cool."

They've added a chocolate waterfall you can swim in, a volcano for toasting marshmallows, a bulldozer-battling level, a baby-dinosaur-petting zoo, a not-very-merry merry-go-round, a boxing elephant called the Trunkinator, an X-ray room, a disco with light-up dance floor, the world's scariest roller coaster and a top-secret 39th level which hasn't even been finished yet! But what good is all this stuff when Andy and Terry are trying to write their fastest book ever? You'll have to read it to find out!"
