Children's literacy charity Beanstalk have put together a list of the best books to motivate and inspire children to read. The Beanstalk Top 40 has been handpicked by children's literacy experts.

Beanstalk's Story Starters reading helpers go into schools and help children develop a love of books and reading. They are currently [recruiting for volunteers in Suffolk](https://www.beanstalkcharity.org.uk/become-a-story-starter). The books on this list will also be part of a starter pack for schools that sign up to the scheme.

Although the list is aimed at reluctant and struggling readers, these are books that all children can enjoy.
