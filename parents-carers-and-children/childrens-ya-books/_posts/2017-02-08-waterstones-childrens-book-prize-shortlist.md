The shortlist for the 2017 Waterstones Children's Prize has been announced today. Winners in the categories of Illustrated Books, Younger Readers and Older Readers, as well as an overall winner, will be announced on Thursday 30 March.  

The books on the shortlist have been described by Waterstones managing director James Daunt as "wonderful books of great power and imagination. They show children’s publishing to be as inventive and inspiring as ever, and to have a pointed relevance that seems never more important in the shaping of ideas and attitudes."
