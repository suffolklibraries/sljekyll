> "Father Christmas is getting ready to deliver the presents - but he keeps getting distracted by some VERY rude noises! Who keeps PARPING?! Could such a big noise actually be coming from someone rather small? More windy fun is in store in this brilliant picture book by the sensational Olaf Falafel."
