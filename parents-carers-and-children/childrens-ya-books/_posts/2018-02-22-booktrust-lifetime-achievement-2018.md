Congratulations to John Burningham and Helen Oxenbury who have won the first-ever double BookTrust Lifetime Achievement Award. They are two of our most well-loved author-illustrators, and have been firm family favourites for generations.

Burningham and Oxenbury have been married for over 50 years but only ever collaborated on one book: [<cite>There's Going to be a Baby</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=375015), published in 2010.
