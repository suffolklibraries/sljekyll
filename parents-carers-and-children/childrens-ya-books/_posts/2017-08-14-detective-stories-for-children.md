The Skulduggery Pleasant books have been so successful that Derek Landy has recently started a second series. In the first book of the first series:

Pursued by evil forces intent on recovering a mysterious key, Stephanie finds help from an unusual source - the wisecracking skeleton of a dead wizard."

Yes, this is exactly as amazing as it sounds.
