Barrington Stoke, who specialise in books for children with dyslexia and visual stress, have published more brilliant titles recently.

> "Laura Norder lives her life by the Golden Rules and so should everybody else. But being Sheriff of Butts Canyon at the age of ten is a big job to handle, and when a no-good rule-breaking bandit causes chaos in the town, enough is enough! It's time for Laura to step up to the plate and catch the masked mischief-maker before he breaks any more of her rules!"

## [<cite>Under the Skin</cite>, by Catherine MacPhail & Tom Percival](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2515208)

> "Chichico is thrilled when a talent scout spots him during a kick-about with his friends Davil and Ana, and he is asked to try out for Santos Brazil. But without a pair of football boots, how will Chichico ever be taken seriously?"

## [<cite>The Ghost Tower</cite>, by Gillian Cross & Sarah Horne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2515206)

> "The night Dot and Ryan take a sneaky Halloween visit to a condemned tower, they discover more than they bargained for when they catch a glimpse of an endangered species of bat. It's clear that the bat colony and the tower need to be saved, but Dot and Ryan were never meant to be there and it's not going to be easy to get the grown-ups on side..."

## [<cite>Ellie and the Cat</cite>, by Malorie Blackman & Matt Robertson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2492484)

## [<cite>Virus</cite>, by Chris Bradford & Andres Frang](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2453200)

> "In [<cite>Gamer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1260456), Scott escaped 'Virtual Kombat' - the all-too-real virtual reality game in which Vince Power risks the lives of street kids for profit. Scott's now on the run and comes across a gang of techno-hackers who share his wish to destroy VK. They've developed a virus that could do the job, but in order to implant it Scott has to re-enter the arena and risk being trapped inside the game forever."

> "Jake is different from the other kids at school. He struggles when routines change and people's emotions are so hard to understand. Christmas can be even worse and often the festivities are just too much to bear. But when Jake finds a little dog lost in the street he unlocks a connection he's never had before."

## [<cite>White Feather</cite>, by Catherine & David MacPhail](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2453201)

> "The war is won but for Charlie there is little to celebrate. His brother never returned from no man's land and has died not as a hero but executed as a coward.

Conclusion of the quartet which began with [<cite>Brock</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1377087), [<cite>Pike</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1752341) and the Carnegie-shortlisted [<cite>Rook</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2153898).

> "Things are tense at home for Nicky and Kenny. Their mum's coming to visit and it will be the first time they've seen her in years. A lot has changed since they were little and Nicky's not so sure he's ready to see her again.

> "When they head for a trek across the moors to take their minds off everything, a series of unforeseen circumstances leaves the brothers in a vulnerable and very dangerous position. There might even be a chance that this time not everyone will make it home alive..."
