> "Belle LOVES the bustle of Christmas preparations at Buckingham Palace, but her family say she's in the way, and that Christmas is NOT for corgis! So Belle decides to slip out and explore London, where she's sure there will be Christmas sprit in abundance!

> "But on the busy streets, Belle finds everything a bit too bright, a bit too noisy and FAR TOO LOUD! Luckily, a streetwise puppy called Pip turns up and whisks Belle off on a wonderfully romantic whirl around the sights of London."
