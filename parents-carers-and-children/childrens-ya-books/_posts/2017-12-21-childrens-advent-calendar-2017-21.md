> "This Christmas, join Michael Rosen and Tony Ross with their unforgettable retelling of Charles Dickens' beloved classic.

> "In a school theatrical production of <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>, the boy who plays Scrooge is extra nervous because his very busy father is in the audience. However, it's likely his father won't stay for the duration, due to business. As always. Will the classic story's message of Christmas cheer and family love reach his father's distracted heart?"
