The new Alligator's Mouth Award celebrates the best short chapter books of the year.

## [<cite>Dave Pigeon (Racer!)</cite>, by Swapna Haddow & Sheena Dempsey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2304745)

> "Dave Pigeon and his best friend Skipper were living happily in the Human Lady's house, but now they're travelling in a box to Pawsville Vets ... maybe Dave will finally get his broken wing fixed.

> "The pet shop is full of new friends... Jet the dog, Cricket Ball Face the hamster... and with friendship comes a bit of healthy competition, and what could be better that a race for a racing pigeon? But the only animal who thinks Dave is capable of going up against the infamous Mickey Lightning is Dave himself."

## [<cite>Nice Work for the Cat and the King</cite>, by Nick Sharratt](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2426387)

> "Alas and alack! The Royal Money Box is almost empty.

> "The king has to get a job - but what kind of job would be fit for a king? Butcher? Baker? Candlestick Maker? It takes many comical disasters, and a surprisingly helpful visit from a dragon, before both cat and king find their perfect jobs."

## [<cite>Little Lies: The Stinky Truth</cite>, by Joe Berger](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2351373)

> "It's the school holidays and Sam and his best friend can't wait to see <cite>Cry Wolfe</cite>, the first movie starring their favourite crime-fighting hero. But Sam's mum has set him a challenge. He can only go and see the movie IF, and only if, he can make it through the entire holiday without telling a single fib.    

> "Can Sam go six whole weeks, without a single porky!?"

## [<cite>Rabbit & Bear: Attack of the Snack</cite>, by Julian Gough & Jim Field](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2381029)

> "Splash! A mysterious thing lands in Rabbit and Bear's peaceful summer lake. Is it exciting, or terrifying? Is it a tiny fluffy owl, or a huge hungry monster? And has Rabbit finally met a creature with worse habits than himself?

> "Rabbit's sure he can solve this mystery. But when he accidentally turns the Best Day Ever into the Worst Day Ever, he needs Bear's help."

## [<cite>The Legend of Kevin</cite>, by Philip Reeve & Sarah McIntyre](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2398367)

> "Kevin the flying pony blows in on a magical storm and - DOOF! - crashes into the balcony outside Max's flat. As the storm waters rise and the town is besieged with creatures, Max and Kevin set about putting things right. With Max's quick thinking and a constant supply of biscuits for Kevin, there's nothing this heroic duo can't achieve."
