<em>Stock librarian Sophie Green picks out the best children's books of the year and predicts what will be popular in 2019.</em>

## Comic books and graphic novels

With so many brilliant illustrators on the scene and highly illustrated non-fiction going strong, not to mention the enduring success of the Marvel universe, it’s not a surprise that comic books and graphic novels are growing in popularity as more and more children (and adults) discover how amazing they are.

### [<cite>Dog Man: Lord of the Fleas</cite>, by Dav Pilkey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2422627)

## Children's audio

Digital and CD audiobooks are doing very well in Suffolk this year. Listening to audiobooks is a great way to experience a story both at home and on the go and our digital stock is increasingly popular for long car journeys.

We've had a run on the eAudiobooks of J. K. Rowling's [<cite>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</cite>, read by Eddie Redmayne](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PTA_442963&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172), [<cite>Quidditch Through the Ages</cite>, read by Andrew Lincoln](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PTA_475176&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172) and [<cite>A History of Magic</cite>, read by Natalie Dormer](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PTA_537158&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172).
