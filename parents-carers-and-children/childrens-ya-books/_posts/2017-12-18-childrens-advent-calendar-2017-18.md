> "Eric and Pan are thrilled to hear something coming down the chimney on Christmas Eve. But their festive visitor isn't quite who they were expecting - Pan's parents are in town for the holidays! With a full house - including, to Eric's dismay, the Blooms - Eric has a tough time of keeping Pan's parents away from his own family. Then disaster strikes, leaving them all without Christmas dinner! Can the Mini-Dragons step in to save the day?"
