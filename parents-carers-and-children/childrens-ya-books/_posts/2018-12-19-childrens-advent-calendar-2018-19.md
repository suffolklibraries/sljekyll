Every day until Christmas Eve, stock librarian Sophie will recommend one of our brilliant new Christmas books for children. Today's book is [<cite>Pick a Pine Tree</cite>, by Patricia Toht & Jarvis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2442722).

> "Pick a pine tree from the lot - slim and tall, or short and squat! Long straight limbs or branches bent - Mmm! Just smell that piney scent!

> "Brimming over with the excitement of being with family at the festive season, a gorgeously rhythmical narrative accompanied by warm, joyful art celebrates all the familiar rituals of decorating the tree - from digging out jam-packed boxes of trimmings, stringing tinsel, to, at last, turning on those twinkly fairy lights."
