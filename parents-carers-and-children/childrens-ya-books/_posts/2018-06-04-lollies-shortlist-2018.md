The Laugh Out Loud Awards (Lollies) celebrate the funniest children's books of the year. There are 3 categories: Picture Books, Books for 6-8 year-olds and Books for 9-13 year-olds.

## Picture Books

### [<cite>I Can Only Draw Worms</cite>, by Will Mabbitt](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093869)

> "This book is about worms. You MIGHT think that worms are boring… but you’d be WRONG. These worms have incredible adventures! Will can’t draw those, though, so you’ll have to imagine them.

> "<cite>I Can Only Draw Worms</cite> is the unconventional counting book that you didn’t know you needed, and certainly would never have expected. Children (and adults!) have been known to snort out loud, get a stitch that lasts for hours and laugh so much their faces ache upon getting to the final page – this is definitely one to read again, and again, and again!"

### [<cite>Mr Bunny's Chocolate Factory</cite>, by Elys Dolan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2103960)

> "As the owner of a large Chocolate Factory, Mr Bunny is never satisfied with his success. When Mr Bunny begins to expect too much of his staff at the Chocolate Factory, he is left to run it alone. Will Mr Bunny realise that many minds are better than one when trying to get a big job done well? Or will his chocolate empire melt under the pressure of running it alone?"

<cite>Mr Bunny's Chocolate Factory</cite> was also shortlisted for the [2018 Little Rebels Award](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/little-rebels-2018/).

### [<cite>Oi Cat!</cite>, by Kes Gray & Jim Field](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2393782)

> "According to Frog: cats sit on gnats; Dogs sit on logs; Raccoons sit on macaroons; Armadillos sit on pillows; and Chicks sit on bricks. But wait! Cat doesn't like sitting on gnats, they keep biting his bottom! Will Frog and Dog help him change the rules?"

### [<cite>The Squirrels who Squabbled</cite>, by Rachel Bright & Jim Field](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315403)

> "Greedy squirrels Cyril and Bruce both have their sights on a very special prize: the very last nut of the season! As the nut bounces crazily though the forest, the squirrels race after it, between the trees, over boulders, down the river and – ARGH! – right to the edge of a waterfall! Working together might be the only way to save themselves now..."

> "I is Pig. This is my diary and I doubts you will believe any of it. In fact, if you is the kind of farmer what finds it hard to believe unbelievable stuff, you should put it down RIGHT NOW. It's all 1000% true and 10,000% BONKERS!"
