This year's children’s poetry books include new editions of old favourites, wonderfully illustrated collections, and exciting debuts.

## [<cite>The Lost Words: a spell book</cite>, by Robert Macfarlane & Jackie Morris](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2257444)

Due in early October, this promises to be a beautiful book to read and look at:

> "From bestselling [<cite>Landmarks</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1956933) author Robert Macfarlane - an illustrated collection of spell-poems to re-wild the language of children."

## [<cite>Eighty Best Poems</cite>, by Roger McGough](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2254686)

Also due out in October, from one of our best-loved poets:

> "There are 80 of Roger McGough's wonderful poems in this hugely enjoyable collection, gathered into a new volume to celebrate his 80th birthday! The poems have been specially chosen to reflect Roger's unique sense of humour, his wit and wisdom and sharp observations on all aspects of life. New, quirky illustrations by the author himself add further enjoyment!"

## [<cite>Message from the Moon and other poems</cite>, by Hilda Offen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2157215)

> "Hilda Offen's new collection is a mixture of imaginative, thoughtful and funny poems. Meet the killer caterpillar on the prowl, the robber rabbit who is a criminal all-rounder, the reading dogs - and a troll who is not afraid to speak out about those Billy-Goats Gruff. There are poems about nature and the seasons and a look at our planet from the moon."

According to Wordery, this is 'a mix of imaginative, thoughtful and funny poems with accessible and intriguing themes.'

## [<cite>How to be a Tiger</cite>, by George Szirtes & Tim Archbold](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2095046)

> "Leap with hares, call out to the sun, run with the wind, pull silly faces with monkeys, watch out for the bear in the bathroom and meet a burping princess! These poems are perfect for curious young minds, ready for adventures."

## [<cite>Little Lemur Laughing</cite>, by Joshua Seigal & Chris Piascik](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2114973)

> "A dragon's sneeze, a dinosaur, a wizard's spell, a monster's claw. All these things and many more - that's what's in a poem. An exciting collection of poems from talented young poet Joshua Seigal, perfect for introducing children to poetry."

## [<cite>Rhyme Stew</cite>, by Roald Dahl & Quentin Blake](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1926817)

Reprint of an old favourite, originally published in 1989:

> "This title presents a collection of irreverent rhymes featuring characters from fairy tales, fables, and nursery rhymes - as you've never seen them before!"

## [<cite>New and Collected Poems for Children</cite>, by Carol Ann Duffy and Alice Stevenson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2124318)

New edition of this 2009 collection:

> "Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, is one of our most read and best-loved poets both in and out of the classroom. This edition of her poems brings together work from her four award-winning collections for children, and sprinkles in a generous helping of new poems to match."

## [<cite>A Child's Garden of Verses</cite>, by Robert Louis Stevenson & Michael Foreman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2207335)

Due in mid-October:

## [<cite>A Rocketful of Space Poems</cite>, by John Foster & Korky Paul](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2102130)

> "Fly into space, drive to the moon, meet an asteroid dog and a flurb blurp and then play intergalactic Squibble-Ball. There are wizards and witches in space, as well as Peter Pluto's fast-food superstore - and the worst monster in the universe. What are you waiting for?"

[<cite>Winnie the Witch</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2043331) illustrator Korky Paul really brings this collection to life.

## [<cite>The Dictionary of Dads</cite>, by Justin Coe & Steve Wells](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2144324)

> "There are more than 50 different dads in <cite>The Dictionary of Dads</cite>. Find your favourite - but watch out for exploding dad! This is a brilliant and funny debut collection from a poet who performs his work in schools and theatres across the UK, with witty illustrations by Steve Wells."

## [<cite>All Aboard the London Bus</cite>, by Patricia Toht & Sam Usher](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2151732)

> "As a family of four spend a day exploring London, fun, child-friendly poems introduce readers to our wonderful capital city, and all its secrets. Well-known landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and the London Eye, plus inescapable features like rain and taking tea, all get Patty Toht's witty treatment. Non-fiction facts provide more information about the subjects, while rising star Sam Usher brings them to life with his signature style and humour."

## [<cite>All the Wild Wonders: poems of our Earth</cite>, by Wendy Cooling (ed.) & Piet Grobler](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2152325)

> "In this celebration of our Earth, distinguished anthologist Wendy Cooling has chosen poems to make children look, think, and ask questions. Why are trees so important? How are motorways damaging our countryside? What can we do about rubbish? What can we do to protect our Earth for the future?"

## [<cite>My Mum's Growing Down</cite>, by Laura Dockrill & David Tazzyman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185136)

> "Mum is a gamer, a party animal and a free spirit making life hard work for her nine year old son. These poems are a glimpse into their parent child relationship; their antics and adventures. The poems are bold, brave, funny and sometimes very moving. This collection shows just how funny, rude and naughty mums can be!"

According to Books For Keeps, 'these poems celebrate the unconventional, they are full of warmth, humour and loving advice, 'you get on with being you and I'll get on with loving you.''

## [<cite>The World's Greatest Space Cadet</cite>, by James Carter & Ed Boxall](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2082936)

> "Join well loved poet James Carter on a journey through time and space: from Vikings to a marauding cat and from the edges of the universe to the world's greatest space cadet."

According to Andrea Reece from LoveReading4Kids, 'his poems will work their magic on all readers, and each one finds something new to say, ans the perfect way to say it. A treat from first page to last.'

## [<cite>Overheard in a Tower Block</cite>, by Joseph Coelho & Kate Milner](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2168959)

> "Gazing at the stars from five storeys up, smelling the bins from five storeys below. Overheard arguments, overheard laughter. A disappearing father and a Mermaid-Queen mother; statues that sing for flesh and blood; bullies who kick you under the table; perfect red trainers - and the things that lurk in the library. Award-winning poet Joseph Coelho's new collection is a powerful and moving poetic narrative about growing up in the city."

According to Booktrust, 'many of these poems are sad or angry or bristle with an edginess that young teens may find refreshing when compared to other poetry aimed at them.'
