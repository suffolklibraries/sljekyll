As it's International Women's Day, we've put together a list of our favourite children's fiction and non-fiction featuring awesome girls and women.

## Fiction

> "When a group of explorers stumble upon a girl living in the forest, they bring her to their concrete apartment block. But our little girl was raised by animals, taught to talk by birds, to eat by bears, to play by foxes. Her captors are in for quite the surprise. They'll soon learn you cannot tame something so happily wild!"

Exciting illustrations and a strong message about nature and what it is to be free-spirited, by Hawaiian artist Hughes.

### [<cite>This Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown</cite>, by Cressida Cowell & Neal Layton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=688285)

The late, great Babette Cole created her irreverent and fiercely independent hero back in 1986.

As the blue-haired explorer sits and sketches, she slowly starts to nod off. By the time she wakes up, the troll has totally disappeared and, even worse, Hilda is lost in a snowstorm. On her way home, Hilda befriends a lonely wooden man, and narrowly avoids getting squashed by a lost giant."
