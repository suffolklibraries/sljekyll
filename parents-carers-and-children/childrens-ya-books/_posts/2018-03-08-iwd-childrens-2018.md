As it's International Women's Day, we've put together a list of our favourite children's fiction and non-fiction featuring awesome girls and women.

## Fiction

### [<cite>Wild</cite>, by Emily Hughes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1961352)

> "When a group of explorers stumble upon a girl living in the forest, they bring her to their concrete apartment block. But our little girl was raised by animals, taught to talk by birds, to eat by bears, to play by foxes. Her captors are in for quite the surprise. They'll soon learn you cannot tame something so happily wild!"

Exciting illustrations and a strong message about nature and what it is to be free-spirited, by Hawaiian artist Hughes.

### [<cite>This Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown</cite>, by Cressida Cowell & Neal Layton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=688285)

> "When the Queen steals Emily Brown's favourite toy and erstwhile companion - a toy rabbit called Stanley - Emily sets out to get him back and teach the naughty monarch a valuable lesson."

Also in the series from the <cite>How to Train your Dragon</cite> creator: [<cite>Emily Brown and the Thing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1724906), [<cite>Emily Brown and the Elephant Emergency</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1769818) and [<cite>Cheer Up your Teddy Bear, Emily Brown!</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1769817).

### [<cite>Princess Smartypants</cite>, by Babette Cole](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=28722)

> "Princess Smartypants does not want to get married. She enjoys being a Ms. But being a rich and pretty princess means that all the princes want her to be their Mrs. Find out how Princess Smartypants fights to preserve her independence in this hilarious fairytale-with-a-difference."

The late, great Babette Cole created her irreverent and fiercely independent hero back in 1986. Other titles in the series are [<cite>Princess Smartypants Breaks the Rules!</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=69483), [<cite>Long Live Princess Smartypants</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=30697), [<cite>Princess Smartypants and the Missing Princes</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2018487) [<cite>Princess Smartypants and the Fairy Geek Mothers</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2144428).

### [<cite>Hilda and the Troll</cite>, by Luke Pearson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1821385)

> "While on an expedition to illustrate the magical creatures of the mountains around her home, Hilda spots a mountain troll. As the blue-haired explorer sits and sketches, she slowly starts to nod off. By the time she wakes up, the troll has totally disappeared and, even worse, Hilda is lost in a snowstorm. On her way home, Hilda befriends a lonely wooden man, and narrowly avoids getting squashed by a lost giant."

Hilda is ‘an adventurous young girl who lives in an idyllic mountainous wilderness with her mother and deerfox companion, Twig’. Other titles in the series are [<cite>Hilda and the Midnight Giant</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1904527), [<cite>Hilda and the Stone Forest</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1939504), [<cite>Hilda and the Bird Parade</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1996627) and [<cite>Hilda and the Black Hound</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2183583). There is also a series on Netflix.

### [<cite>Frogkisser</cite>, by Garth Nix](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2246125)

> "Garth Nix is on hilarious form as he spins his very own fairy tale, featuring Princess Anya, who, with her loyal dog, must embark on a terribly important (capital Q) Quest to acquire the ingredients for a reversal lip balm, the vital item needed to change a frog back to a prince - oh, and save her kingdom from her villainous step(step)father."

Featuring an almost all-female cast of princesses, wizards, warriors, robbers and transfigured animals, this is a funny and a great adventure.

### <cite>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</cite>, by Lewis Carroll

This classic story needs no introduction. Try versions illustrated by [John Tenniel](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1833399), [Alison Jay](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2022729), [Anthony Browne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2020534) or [Helen Oxenbury](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1681664).

> "In the land of Ingary, where seven league boots and cloaks of invisibility do exist, Sophie Hatter catches the unwelcome attention of the Witch of the Waste and is put under a spell."

This has also been made into a [critically acclaimed and magical film by Studio Ghibli](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=902133) and a [four-volume graphic novel adaptation which starts here](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1009289).

### [<cite>Coraline</cite>, by Neil Gaiman & Chris Riddell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1457768)

> "When Coraline explores her new home, she steps through a door and into another house just like her own - except that it's different. It's a marvellous adventure until Coraline discovers that there's also another mother and another father in the house. They want Coraline to stay with them for ever."

This is also [a tremendous stop-motion animation film from Laika](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=908468).

### [<cite>Lockwood and Co: The screaming staircase</cite>, by Jonathan Stroud](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1614754)

A hilarious and terrifying series for older children. Despite the misleading title and the image on the cover the main character isn’t Anthony Lockwood but his fellow ghost-busting team mate, Lucy Carlyle.

The other books in the series are [<cite>The Creeping Shadow</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2014847), [<cite>The Hollow Boy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1818975), [<cite>The Whispering Skull</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1727092) and [<cite>The Empty Grave</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2196162).

### [<cite>Northern Lights</cite>, by Philip Pullman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1726172)

In the first book in this outstanding series:

> "When Lyra's friend Roger disappears, she and her daemon, Pantalaimon, determine to find him. The ensuing quest leads them into the bleak splendour of the North, where armoured bears rule the ice and witch-queens fly through the frozen skies."

There's also an excellent [audiobook version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2010930).
