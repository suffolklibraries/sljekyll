Several UK books were longlisted for this year's Biennial of Illustrations Bratislava (BIB) award, which recognises the world's best children's book illustrators.

This year's winner was Ludwig Volbeda, whose work can be seen in [<cite>Tortot: the cold fish who lost his world and found his heart</cite>, by Benny Lindelauf and translated by Laura Watkinson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2271805).
