For children aged 5+:

> "Jo-Jo's mum and dad are arguing again - but this time it's on Christmas Eve and Jo-Jo's convinced it's all his fault. He's been spoiled, selfish and greedy - and his badness has actually killed Father Christmas.

> "To make amends, Jo-Jo decides that he must be Father Christmas - and so he fills sacks with his old toys and puts on mum's long red coat. But then a magical encounter with the real Father Christmas shows Jo-Jo that the true message of Christmas is the giving of love, not of gifts."

They teach Maglos the secrets of a new, strong metal which will soon be all important - the secret of the stones."

## [<cite>The Last Days of Archie Maxwell</cite>, by Annabel Pitcher](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2271801)

For young teens:

> "Dads leave home all the time. It's not that unusual, really. Leon's dad walked out. So did Mo's. But Archie's? Well, that's a different story - a story that Archie must keep secret at all cost. Archie knows he should accept Dad for who he is, so he hides his turmoil until he can stand it no longer. With nowhere else to turn, he finds himself at the railway track. The track has been calling to him, promising escape, release. The only problem is, it's been calling to someone else too."

## [<cite>Grave Matter</cite>, by Juno Dawson & Alex T. Smith](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2246920)

He is drowning in grief and his overwhelming need to reunite with Eliza drives him to the forces of black magic, in a bid to bring her back to life. But he has difficult choices to make and the terrifying consequences of dark magic are about to raise their head."
