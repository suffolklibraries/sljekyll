> "But when the Bolds take in a couple of race horses who are on the run, they worry their animal magnetism is getting to be too much. Have these hyenas bitten off more than they can chew?"

### [<cite>Dragon's Green</cite>, by Scarlett Thomas, read by Roger Allam](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392031)

> "It's been 92 hours since Beaky last told a lie. So far he's survived two full days of school with only three light beatings, two telling-offs and one wedgie - but the annual school trip is going to take Beaky's survival skills to a whole other level - especially as a mix up in the school office means that Beaky and his class are on a trip to Learning Land, a rubbish theme park aimed at eight-year-olds. And home to cheery-but-creepy Clumso the Clued-up Clown whose job is to dish out fascinating facts to one and all.

> "But there is worse to come when Beaky's partnered with Wayne, the school bully, who has a morbid fear of clowns. With Beaky unable to tell a lie and Wayne intent on beating him up, things aren't looking good. And that's before they find themselves on the run from a manic clown who'll seemingly stop at nothing to track them down."

### [<cite>The Terrible Two</cite>, by Mac Barnett & Jory John, read by Adam Verner](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2061218)

> "Miles Murphy had it made. He lived in a great town near the ocean, he had two best friends, and most importantly, he had a reputation for being his town's best prankster. All of which explains why he's not happy to be moving to Yawnee Valley, a sleepy town that's famous for one thing and one thing only: cows. Worse than that, Miles quickly discovers that Yawnee Valley already has a prankster — and a great one. If Miles is going to take the title from this mystery kid, he'll have to raise his game.

> "It's prankster against prankster in an epic war of trickery, until the two finally decide to join forces to pull off the biggest prank ever seen, a prank so huge it would make the members of the International Order of Disorder (a loose confederacy of pranksters that flourished a couple of centuries ago) proud."

### [<cite>Black Beauty</cite>, by Anna Sewell, read by Ralph Cosham](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/666140)

> "From its first publication in 1877, <cite>Black Beauty</cite> has been one of the best-loved animal stories ever written. The dramatic and heartwarming tale is told by the magnificent black horse himself, from his idyllic days on a country squire's estate to his harsh fate as a London cab horse and his merciful rescue by two kindly old ladies.

> "Filled with vivid anecdotes about animal intelligence, the novel derives a special magic from the love of all creatures, great and small, apparent on every page. But the book's lasting impact comes from its descriptions of a human society struggling to find the goodness within itself and its plea for kindness to all creatures—a message so powerful that this favourite classic began a crusade for animal welfare that continues to this day."
