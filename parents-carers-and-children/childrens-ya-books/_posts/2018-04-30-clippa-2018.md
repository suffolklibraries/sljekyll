The shortlist for the 2018 CLiPPA (Centre for Literacy in Primary Poetry Award) has recently been announced. The award was launched in 2003 and is the only one for published poetry for children.

Last year's winner was [<cite>Moon Juice</cite>, by Kate Wakeling](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2090692)

## [<cite>Where Zebras Go</cite>, by Sue Hardy-Dawson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2095049)

> "Get ready to join in the Poetry Olympics, question a snake, talk to a toad and learn 20 ways to avoid monsters and mythical beasts.

> "<cite>Where Zebras Go</cite> will lead you on a magical journey across the savannah, into fairytale realms, back into the playground and through the seasons, introducing a whole host of animals along the way."

## [<cite>The Rainmaker Danced</cite>, by John Agard, illustrated by Satoshi Kitamura](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2257529)

> "Do triangles ever get into a tangle when their sides meet their angles?

> "In this collection of poems, John Agard draws on themes from nature and science to identity and inclusion, to inspire every reader. Here, we become transported by words and form on a journey through past and present. We are invited to answer life's questions, while having a great deal of fun at the same time.

> "Answers are folly when questions are bliss? Without questions, do I exist?"

## [<cite>Overheard in a Tower Block</cite>, by Joseph Coelho, illustrated by Kate Milner](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2168959)

> “Gazing at the stars from five storeys up, smelling the bins from five storeys below. Overheard arguments, overheard laughter. A disappearing father and a Mermaid-Queen mother; statues that sing for flesh and blood; bullies who kick you under the table; perfect red trainers - and the things that lurk in the library. Award-winning poet Joseph Coelho’s new collection is a powerful and moving poetic narrative about growing up in the city.”

<cite>Overheard in a Tower Block</cite> was also nominated for the [2018 Carnegie Medal](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/carnegie-longlist-2018/).

## [<cite>Rising Stars: New Young Voices in Poetry</cite>, by various, illustrated by Riya Chowdhury, Elanor Chuah & Joe Manners](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2262037)

This Arts Council England-sponsored anthology showcases the work of five debut poets from diverse backgrounds, all aged 25 and under. Ruth Awolola, Victoria Adukwei Bulley, Abigail Cook, Jay Hulme and Amina Jama each present eight poems for 10-14 year-olds, covering a wide range of themes and moods.

## [<cite>Moonrise</cite>, by Sarah Crossan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2183901)

> “Joe hasn’t seen his brother for ten years, and it’s for the most brutal of reasons. Ed is on death row. But now Ed’s execution date has been set, and Joe is determined to spend those last weeks with him, no matter what other people think. What value do you place on life? What can you forgive? And just how do you say goodbye?”

<cite>Moonrise</cite> was also nominated for the [YA Book Prize 2018](/new-suggestions/young-adult/ya-book-prize-2018/) and the [Costa Children's Book Award 2018](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/costa-shortlist/). Reviewer Emily has described it as ['a powerful, poignant story that will stay with you long after the final page'](/new-suggestions/young-adult/moonrise-by-sarah-crossan/).

## [<cite>Rhythm and Poetry</cite>, by Karl Nova](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2247509)

> "In <cite>Rhythm and Poetry</cite>, the beauty of rap lyricism and hip hop-influenced poetry is displayed with wit, humour and positivity. Karl Nova's approach is to meet young people where they are and engage them with the style and attitude they are familiar with. This collection reflects on his journey of growth from childhood to adulthood through the lens of hip hop culture. A lot of the verses have already impacted many lives as he travels and delivers them with his unique and energetic style."
