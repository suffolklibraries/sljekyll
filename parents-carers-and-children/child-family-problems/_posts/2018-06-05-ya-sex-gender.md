> "Being a girl is not all sugar and spice. How can you possibly survive school and even think about talking to your crush when you have spots in places you didn't even know you had, your boobs are too big (or too small) and the friend drama is off the charts? Luckily, Hayley Long provides a straight-talking guide to puberty - from cattiness to kisses, and everything in between."

## [<cite>Being a Boy</cite>, by Juno (formerly James) Dawson & Spike Gerrell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1470655)

> "Sexting, virginity, consent, the big O...let's face it, doing it can be tricksy. I don't know anyone (including myself) who has sex all figured out. So I've written a book full of honest, hilarious (and sometimes awkward) anecdotes, confessions and revelations. And because none of us have all the answers, I've invited some friends and fellow YouTubers to talk about their sexuality, too.

> "We talk about doing it safely. Doing it joyfully. Doing it when you're ready. Not doing it. Basically, doing it the way you want, when you want."

## [<cite>Doing It Right: making smart, safe, and satisfying choices about sex</cite>, by Bronwen Pardes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1454239)

> "Teens can often find sex very difficult to navigate. Maybe the time is now, maybe it's years away. No matter what, they need to be ready both in their minds and bodies. All teens have questions and they can't always ask their parents and friends for answers.

> "Thankfully 'The Sex Lady' breaks it down in <cite>Doing it Right</cite>, which deals with issues like STIs, birth control and being emotionally ready. The more teens know and understand about the issues surrounding sex, the easier it is for them to make safe, smart and satisfying decisions about their sexuality."

> "A funny, sad and serious memoir, <cite>How to Be Happy</cite> is David Burton's story of his turbulent life at high school and beyond. He longs to have a girlfriend, but his first date is a disaster. There's the catastrophe of the school swimming carnival and friendships that take devastating turns.

> "Being a teenager is difficult enough, but having to go through puberty whilst realising you're in the wrong body means dealing with a whole new set of problems: bullying, self-doubt and in some cases facing a physical and medical transition.

> "Alex is an ordinary teenager: he likes pugs, donuts, retro video games and he sleeps with his socks on. He's also transgender, and was born female. He's been living as a male for the past few years and he has recently started his physical transition. Throughout this book, Alex will share what it means to be in his shoes, as well as his personal advice to other trans teens."
