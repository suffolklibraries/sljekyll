## [<cite>Daddy, Papa and Me</cite>, by Lesléa Newman & Carol Thompson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=405057)

## [<cite>Morris and the Bundle of Worries</cite>, by Jill Seeney & Rachel Fuller](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1367389)

> "Morris the mole has a secret. He has lots of worries - in fact, a big bundle of them. The worries fill up his bedroom which means he can't sleep. Morris doesn't know what to do. There are squiggly, wriggly worries, thorny, spiky ones, and even some TERRORS, which Morris is too scared to touch. The worries float around his head, and prick his paws, and make him shiver. He's scared to tell the other woodland animals about them.

> "But one day, Morris finds a friend who can help him, and realises that problems are easier to deal with when you've got someone to talk to. Suddenly, the worries don't seem so frightening any more.

> "A charming picture book for young children in a range of situations, <cite>Morris and the Bundle of Worries</cite> shows that talking about problems, and facing worries with the help of others is more helpful than hiding your fears."
