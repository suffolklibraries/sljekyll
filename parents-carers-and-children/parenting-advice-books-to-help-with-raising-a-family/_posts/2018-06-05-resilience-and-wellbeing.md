> "Björk, Dr Seuss, Whoopi Goldberg, Andy Warhol, Ellen MacArthur, Greta Gerwig, Andrea Bocelli, Hua Mulan - these are men and women who all dared to be different.

> "Boys will be boys and girls will be girls - or so the meaningless saying goes. Because what if you’re a girl and you like cage fighting? Or you’re a boy and you love ballet? And what if you’ve always dreamed of being a scientist but you can’t see anyone who looks or sounds like you, and who has left a legacy - in the form of microscopes and Bunsen burners - for you to follow?

> "This is the book for children who want to know about the lives of those heroes who have led the way, changing the world for the better as they go."

Now younger readers can discover the Wonder message with this gorgeous picture book, starring Auggie and his dog Daisy on an original adventure, written and illustrated by R.J. Palacio.

> "With spare, powerful text and richly-imagined illustrations, We’re All Wonders shows readers what it’s like to live in Auggie’s world - a world in which he feels like any other kid, but he’s not always seen that way."

> "This story stars a brother and sister, Sam and Kate, and their dog, Fuzzy Bean. Sam and Kate know what makes them happy: cuddling Mum, reading a story with Dad, swimming, running and dancing, lots of things. But they don't feel happy all the time (nor does Fuzzy Bean), and in the course of the book we see them feeling grumpy, embarrassed, shy, nervous, frightened, sad and jealous.

> "Both words and pictures portray the children in many different situations at home and at school, and show how they change over time, how emotions can escalate, and how people can help each other."

> "You can't see mental wellbeing but you can feel it. Your mental wellbeing is all about how you think and feel. Some people call it 'mental health' or 'emotional wellbeing'.

> "Having good mental health doesn't mean being happy all the time. We all experience feelings of anger, sadness, fear and frustration. These feelings are perfectly normal. Mental wellbeing comes from finding positive ways to manage these feelings as you grow and develop.

> "This simply written title explores what mental health is, why it is important and ways to deal with some mental health problems such as stress and anxiety."
