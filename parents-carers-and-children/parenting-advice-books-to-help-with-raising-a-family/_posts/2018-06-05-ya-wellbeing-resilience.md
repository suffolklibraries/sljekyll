## [<cite>Mind Your Head</cite>, by Juno Dawson, Dr Olivia Hewitt & Gemma Correll](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1896983)

> "We all have a mind, so we all need to take care of our mental health as much as we need to take care of our physical health. And the first step is being able to talk about our mental health.

> "Juno Dawson leads the way with this frank, factual and funny book, with added information and support from clinical psychologist Dr Olivia Hewitt. Covering topics from anxiety and depression to addiction, self-harm and personality disorders, Juno and Olivia talk clearly and supportively about a range of issues facing young people's mental health - whether fleeting or long-term - and how to manage them, with real-life stories from young people around the world."

## [<cite>Stuff That Sucks: accepting what you can't change and committing to what you can</cite>, by Ben Sedley](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1835954)

> "Each of us has thoughts that are painful at times; sometimes the pain is sadness, sometimes worry or anger or shame or grief or some feeling that you don't even have words for. If you are a young person struggling with your emotions, you do not want to be told that 'everyone feels like that' or that 'you will grow out of it'. You want to feel that your emotions are valid and that the person offering help truly understands how painful life can feel at times.

> "With a strong emphasis on validation and compassion, <cite>Stuff That Sucks</cite> encourages you to accept your emotions rather than struggling against them. It also shows how to reconnect with what is really important to you, giving you the tools to help clarify your personal values and take steps towards living a life where those values can guide you in your day-to-day behaviour."

## [<cite>The Self-Esteem Team's Guide to Sex, Drugs and WTFs?!!</cite>, by Grace Barrett, Natasha Devon & Nadia Mendoza](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1843507)

> "This guide contains everything you really want to know, but are too embarrassed to ask your teachers, from 'how do I know if I'm healthy?' to 'what's it like to take drugs?'

> "The Self-Esteem Team won't tell you that if you have sex you'll definitely get an STI and die, but they will help you decide if you're ready. They won't tell you never to watch porn, but they will help you decipher what you see. They won't ask you not to embrace fashion, fitness or beauty, but they will give you the info you need to rock your own brand of gorgeous."

> "We all know that growing up is hard to do, and sometimes the only thing that makes it better are the reassuring words of someone who has walked that bumpy road just a few steps ahead of you and somehow ended up as a fully-functioning adult.

> "Thanks to her phenomenally popular YouTube videos, Carrie Hope Fletcher has become an 'honourary big sister' to hundreds of thousands of young people who turn to her for advice, friendship and, most of all, the knowledge that things will get better.
