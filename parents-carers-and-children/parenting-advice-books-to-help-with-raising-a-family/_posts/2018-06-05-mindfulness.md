In doing so he not only finds a new friend, but enjoys a whole new world of experiences."

> "This boy's-eye-view of the everyday brings alive all the wonder and oddity of the world inside our own heads. It captures the magic that a child can find in common objects and day-to-day encounters - bananas, clouds, toys, breakfast, stars. Each of these simple things sparks a new train of thought, and the results is a gorgeous mix of the poetic and prosaic which will touch the child - and the heart - in all of us."
