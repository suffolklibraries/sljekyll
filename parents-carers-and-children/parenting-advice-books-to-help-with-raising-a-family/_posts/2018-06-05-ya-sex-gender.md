> "Being a girl is not all sugar and spice. How can you possibly survive school and even think about talking to your crush when you have spots in places you didn't even know you had, your boobs are too big (or too small) and the friend drama is off the charts? Luckily, Hayley Long provides a straight-talking guide to puberty - from cattiness to kisses, and everything in between."

> "Sexting, virginity, consent, the big O...let's face it, doing it can be tricksy. I don't know anyone (including myself) who has sex all figured out. So I've written a book full of honest, hilarious (and sometimes awkward) anecdotes, confessions and revelations. And because none of us have all the answers, I've invited some friends and fellow YouTubers to talk about their sexuality, too.

> "We talk about doing it safely. Doing it joyfully. Doing it when you're ready. Not doing it. Basically, doing it the way you want, when you want."

> "Teens can often find sex very difficult to navigate. Maybe the time is now, maybe it's years away. No matter what, they need to be ready both in their minds and bodies. All teens have questions and they can't always ask their parents and friends for answers.

> "Thankfully 'The Sex Lady' breaks it down in <cite>Doing it Right</cite>, which deals with issues like STIs, birth control and being emotionally ready. The more teens know and understand about the issues surrounding sex, the easier it is for them to make safe, smart and satisfying decisions about their sexuality."

> "Mae Martin is a Canadian comedian with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry Potter trivia. Aside from this, if there's one area that she's 100% anecdotally and personally qualified to tackle, it's sexuality: should there be any such thing as a 'sexuality spectrum', then Mae has probably existed at every point on it at some stage in her life.

> "This book is Mae's attempt to demystify sexuality by narrating her own often humiliating adventures in sex, dating and gender identity."

He's been living as a male for the past few years and he has recently started his physical transition.
