> "One night Chick hopped into the farmer's house and had a little browse on his computer. Soon she's bought a funny teapot, a frilly blouse, scooters for the sheep and a car for the cows. She just can't stop clicking! She meets a friend online and off she goes to meet him (without telling Mum or Dad). But the friend she thought she'd met turns out to be a fox."

What will Daddy Bear do when he sees that online?"
