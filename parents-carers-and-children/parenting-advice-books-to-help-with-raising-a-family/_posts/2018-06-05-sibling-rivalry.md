> "One little girl dreams of being a star. But whether it's finding Mum's lost wedding ring or winning the fancy-dress prize, her big sister always shines brighter.

> "Yet for her grandad she is a star and, as he dries her eyes and they both gaze up at the night sky, he tells a story, the story of the beginning of the world. Everything and everyone is made of stardust, and we all shine in different ways. It's a lesson this little girl will never forget - and one day her dream comes true, and she finally realises her ambition to become an astronaut and fly up to the stars."

Ruby stomps out into the garden and there she begins to wonder - what if she could magic Oliver away?"
