## [<cite>Teeth Are Not for Biting</cite>, by Elizabeth Verdick](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1393848)

> "Sooner or later, almost all young children will bite someone - a friend, a parent, a sibling. This upbeat, colourful, virtually indestructible book helps prevent biting and teaches positive alternatives."

## [<cite>No More Biting for Billy Goat!</cite>, by Bernadette Ford & Sam Williams](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1458423)

> "It's Billy Goat's first day at school, and he feels lost and lonely. Even though he really wants to join in the fun and games, he just doesn't know how. Billy Goat gets so frustrated that he even bites Piggy, Lambkin, and Bunny! But with a little gentle guidance from sympathetic Ducky, he learns that teeth are for biting food - not your friends."
