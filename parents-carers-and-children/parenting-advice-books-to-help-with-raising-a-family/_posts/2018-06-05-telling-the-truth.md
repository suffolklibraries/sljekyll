## [<cite>Dogs Can't Fly</cite>, by Katharine Eccles Horn](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1339520)

## [<cite>This is Not My Hat</cite>, by Jon Klassen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1639716)

> "When a tiny fish shoots into view wearing a round blue top hat (which happens to fit him perfectly), trouble could be following close behind. So it's a good thing that enormous fish won't wake up. And even if he does, it's not as though he'll ever know what happened - will he?"

> "The bear's hat is gone and he wants it back. Patiently and politely he asks the animals he comes across whether they have seen it. Each animal says no, some more elaborately than others. But just as he begins to lose hope a deer comes by and asks a question that suddenly sparks the bear's memory."

> "Once there was a boy named Tim whom no one believed, even when he was telling the truth. No one believed that it was a ninja who snaffled the last slice of cake; or that a giant squid ate his homework; or that it really was a time-travelling monkey who was throwing pencils at Grampa. How can Tim get his parents to believe him?"

## [<cite>Pig the Fibber</cite>, by Aron Blabey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1812930)
