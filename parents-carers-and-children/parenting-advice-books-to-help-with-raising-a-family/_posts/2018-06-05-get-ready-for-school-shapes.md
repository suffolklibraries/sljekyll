## [<cite>Elmer Shapes</cite>, by David McKee](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2522229)

## [<cite>Lift-the-flap Shapes</cite>, by Margot Channing & Ilana Exelby](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2337197)

> "Pre-school learners can practise their reading, numeracy and shape-recognition skills with this enormously entertaining lift-the-flap book. The reader is asked to answer the questions about shapes around the edges of the pages and then lift the flaps to see if they got the answers correct. The book moves from introducing basic shapes to talking about how many sides they have and how different shapes can be used together."

## [<cite>Shapes</cite>, by Courtney Dicmas](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2164869)

> "Courtney Dicmas introduces babies to basic concepts with her award-winning charm and humour. <cite>Shapes</cite> cleverly demonstrates the way that different shapes appear in nature, through the outlines of animals, or through the negative space between them and their family members."

## [<cite>Bear in a Square: a book of shapes</cite>, by AmÃ©lie Faliere & Tasha Percy](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2127349)

## [<cite>Circle, Triangle, Elephant! A book of shapes & surprises</cite>, by Kenji Oikawa & Mayuko Takeuchi](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138322)

> "A clever and refreshing approach to learning about shapes, with a bit of silliness mixed in. The book offers a breath of fresh air within this well-established toddler concept genre.

> "With bright block-art visuals and a rhythmic, read-aloud text, it begins by offering familiar shapes - a triangle, a circle, and a square - and then throws an elephant into the equation: triangle, elephant, circle. Surely an elephant doesn't belong in a book on shapes - or does it?"
