Whilst driving may be a distant memory in lockdown, the spirit and passion of songs like <cite>Highway to Hell</cite> and <cite>Autobahn</cite> make them a must-listen wherever you are.

Comment from Brandon King, our Stock Librarian on <cite>Autobahn</cite>:

> "I had to include this after the sad death of Florian Schneider, one of my musical heroes. Incredible to think they wrote this in 1974 and recorded it on basic equipment. The joy of driving to somewhere other than a supermarket.."
