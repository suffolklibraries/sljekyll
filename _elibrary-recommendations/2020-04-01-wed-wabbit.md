## About the author

[Lissa Evans](https://lissaevans.com/) grew up in the West Midlands. She comes from a family of bookworms and spent most of her childhood trawling through her local library.

Lissa went on to study medicine at Newcastle University and worked as a junior doctor for four years. However, she then decided to switch over to radio and television (which was much less scary), during which time she won a BAFTA. Lissa has written five books for adults and three books for children, including Wed Wabbit. She now lives in London with her husband and two daughters – and still reads any books she can get her hands on!
