> A depressed musician (Tom Hiddleston) reunites with his lover (Tilda Swinton). Though their romance, which has already endured several centuries, is disrupted by the arrival of her uncontrollable younger sister (Mia Wasikowska).

Artistic, sophisticated and centuries old, two vampire lovers ponder their ultimate place in modern society.

Nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Best Screenplay and Best Female Lead at the Film Independent Spirit Awards and Festival Favorites nominee at the SXSW Film Festival.
