**Children’s eAudiobook title for May is [Moone Boy: The Blunder Years](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=MDA_501300&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172) by Chris O'Dowd and Nick Vincent Murphy**

> "Martin Moone is 11 and fed up with being the only boy in a family of girls. With three elder sisters, he's desperate for a sidekick to help him fight his corner. When best mate Padraic suggests getting an imaginary friend, he decides to give it a go. His first attempt is Loopy Lou, who loves practical jokes and is a dab hand at balloon-modelling."

> "But Martin soon gets fed up with Lou's clowning around, so selects Sean 'Caution' Murphy instead. Sean is much more up Martin's street - and full of advice about how Martin should negotiate day-to-day life, from dealing with his sisters' pranks to beating the bullying Bonner Boys."

> "But getting rid of Lou is not that easy, and two imaginary friends is a recipe for trouble!"

Creative writing prompts

- Create your own imaginary friend – picture them and write a description. Think about their age, what clothes they are wearing, what they look like. Think about what their habits might be and what particular phrases they might say. [See an example by Kate &rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsnN1KVCrHM)
- Write a diary entry for a day spent either at home or at school with your imaginary friend. What did you get up to? You could also try a comic-strip diary where you draw and illustrate what you have been up to.

- Try writing a diary entry from the perspective of Sean ‘Caution’ Murphy
