Wild Reads is a partnership project between Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk Wildlife Trust to promote our connection between the natural world and the written word.

Wild Reads is new for 2020 and aims to give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the very best nature writing the lenses of a wide variety of writers.

This spring's Wild Read is [<cite>Meadowland</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1350540?cid=1073992) by John Lewis-Stempel. Every other month we will be celebrating a different Wild Read from our book list.

See <cite>Meadowland</cite> synopsis below:

> Meadowland gives an unique and intimate account of an English meadow’s life from January to December, together with its biography. In exquisite prose, John Lewis-Stempel records the passage of the seasons from cowslips in spring to the hay-cutting of summer and grazing in autumn, and includes the biographies of the animals that inhabit the grass and the soil beneath: the badger clan, the fox family, the rabbit warren, the skylark brood and the curlew pair, among others. Their births, lives, and deaths are stories that thread through the book from first page to last.
