Suffolk Libraries Local are weekly libraries in communities that do not have a static library.

Customers can browse and borrow books, place reservations from the main Suffolk Libraries catalogue, use the internet and take part in a range of activities for all ages.

## Suffolk Libraries Local in your community

We would welcome opportunities to provide Suffolk Libraries Local sessions in the future and are interested in hearing from any local organisations who might be able to fund sessions in their area.

We'd also like to hear from organisations who are interested in using the Shotley sessions to reach local people, for example to deliver information or advice.

If you have any queries, email **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
