        <p class="mt2">Suffolk Libraries Local is a new initiative between Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk County Council. It will bring the opportunity for residents of geographical locations not directly served by a static library to:</p>

				<ul>

				 		<li>Browse and borrow from a selection of books</li>
						<li>Attend a range of activities for all age groups</li>
						<li>Use IT facilities for research, work and pleasure.</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="mt2">The pilot scheme will initially run once a week in three existing community venues, Red Lodge, Shotley and Moreton Hall, for a period of six months each. We will be holding consultations with local residents. This initiative is supplementary to existing public and mobile libraries.</p>
