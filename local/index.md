**Since March 2017 we have run a broadly successful six-month pilot project to provide Suffolk Libraries Local sessions in three locations across the county: Moreton Hall, Red Lodge and Shotley.**

Suffolk Libraries Local has been a Suffolk County Council funded experiment exploring ways of providing the library experience to communities not served by a static library. **Although the initial funding was for six months, we were able to extend the project until late November at Moreton Hall and Red Lodge**.

Moreton Hall customers' closest static libraries are [Bury St Edmunds](/libraries/bury-st-edmunds-library) and [Thurston](/libraries/thurston-library/). [Bury St Edmunds Mobile Library Route 17](/mobiles-home/bury-st-edmunds-mobile-library-route-17/) stops at the Community Centre every fourth Tuesday.

Red Lodge customers' closest static libraries are [Mildenhall](/libraries/mildenhall-library/) and [Newmarket](/libraries/newmarket-library/), and [Bury St Edmunds Mobile Library Route 15](/mobiles-home/bury-st-edmunds-mobile-library-route-15/) stops at Heathersett Way every fourth Sunday.

**The Shotley sessions have been chosen to continue until March 2018** as they have been the most popular and are in the location which is furthest from a static library.

We would welcome opportunities to provide Suffolk Libraries Local sessions in the future and are interested in hearing from any local organisations who might be able to fund sessions in their area.

We'd also like to hear from organisations who are interested in using the Shotley sessions to reach local people, for example to deliver information or advice.
