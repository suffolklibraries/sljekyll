Let’s Talk Reading is a partnership project which aims to eradicate the literacy deficit in Ipswich. Primarily funded through Suffolk County Council’s Raising the Bar programme, with support from other funders, the project is working with a significant number of schools and community organisations across the town to put in place literacy interventions for young people and families.

The library service is a key partner for this project and will host this role on behalf of the Let’s Talk Reading project board.

The project has established itself over the past eight months and the initial groundwork to get the project up-and-running has been successful. The project is specifically working within two geographic clusters of the town (south-east Ipswich and west Ipswich) and a number of local schools and community organisations are now signed-up and committed to the aims of the project. Professionals from each of these organisations are collaborating through two Steering Groups, one in each geography.

The role is to work with the steering groups, schools and community organisations to assist them to collaborate and make best use of available literacy interventions within the project’s budget. Alongside this, the successful applicant will be working as the main administrator for the project board to ensure the project remains on track.

We are interested in someone who:

- is highly organised and can work to tight timescales and deadlines
- has excellent inter-personal skills and is able to be the first point of contact for partners and contractors
- can communicate well with a variety of different stakeholders and using social media
- can work flexibly and manage their workload suitably
- is able to help administer the project budget
- can organise and minute meetings effectively

This position is part time – 15 hours per week - for a period of ten months (with the possibility of extension). Rate of pay is &pound;18,000pa, pro rata, for the fixed-term contract.
