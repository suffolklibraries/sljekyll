Our mobile library service is a public access mobile library, visiting rural communities throughout Suffolk. We currently operate 3 large vehicles, visiting 587 different locations on a four weekly timetable.

We are currently looking for a relief mobile driver to drive a mobile library vehicle around Ipswich (other locations around Bury and Saxmundham may be required) to an agreed schedule.

You would be required to ensure that the vehicle is fit for purpose by undertaking regular routine maintenance checks. You would also be responsible for the security and cleanliness of the vehicle and for the service offered to customers.

We're looking for an individual who:

- Has extensive experience of driving (preferably a 7.5 tonne vehicle) and holds a full clean C1 category driving license
- Can demonstrate appropriate and effective communication skills with the aim of building positive and supportive relations with our customers and community
- Is confident and competent in using the internet, email and a variety of devices and applications
- Can be proactive and promote innovative ideas that will help make the library relevant and increase the use of the mobile library service.

If you have experience in a customer facing role, enjoy helping people, hold a clean full C1 driving license and an interest in books and computers, we would like to hear from you.

This relief position is based on covering permanent staff absences, including at weekends, due to annual leave, training or sickness.

The rate of pay commences at &pound;10.15 per hour.

If you are interested, please send a CV and supporting statement outlining what you could bring to this position and Suffolk Libraries to: **recruitment@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
