## The story so far

Friends of Ixworth Library (FOIL) was set up in 2013 to support the library in this beautiful and historical village. We fundraise to help buy equipment, support refurbishment projects and enhance activities.

In January 2015, FOIL launched a weekly art group that meets when the library is closed. The art group has been an enormous success, giving members of the community somewhere to come and meet like-minded individuals, practice techniques, learn from each other and make new friends. The art group displays their work to the public in the library with a view to selling them to raise further funds for FOIL.

We have supported the purchase of eReaders for library customers to borrow and offer introductory training courses for older users.

Since 2016, thanks to investment from Suffolk Libraries and Arts Council, we have run a monthly Film Night in the Village Hall.
