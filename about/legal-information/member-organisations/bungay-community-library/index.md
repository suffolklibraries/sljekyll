## Contact us

It's simple to become a member and costs a nominal £1 membership fee. If you're interested in joining us, call into the library for an application form for further details.

## The story so far

We're a registered charity (Registered Charity Number 1151649), set up in 2012 as a direct response to the need for a community group to support the library and raise funds for further development. We're made up of a board of trustees and 71 members.

## Recent successes

* Sylvia Knights was nominated and voted to the Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Board in September 2015. She has since been appointed Vice Chair.
* Raised funds at a book sale in 2019 to go towards redevelopment of the library foyer.
* Used funds raised in 2018 to install bespoke shelving for the children’s library, a bespoke self-service machine stand and a display table for new books.
* Re-carpeted the downstairs of the library.

## Future plans

To continue to promote the library and its services.
