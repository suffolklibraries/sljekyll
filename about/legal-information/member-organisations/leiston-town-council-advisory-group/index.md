The library was redecorated in 2015 and is a warm and welcoming place to be. It also supports the town's Fair Trade status, selling Fair Trade hot drinks and chocolate, making it a lovely place to spend time.

This has all been made possible by generous grants from:

* Leiston and Sizewell Communities Fund
* Enabling Communities Fund
* Leiston Town Council who, as well as giving a grant, support us in so many ways
* Westleton, Knodishall and Aldringham, Theberton and Eastbridge Parish Councils

## Fundraising

Library staff, volunteers and the advisory group have been fundraising for the library and have generated funds from Waitrose, craft sales and shortly cards and stamps.

## Future Plans

The future looks bright for our library and we are confident that we will continue to provide an exciting, reliable, relevant and progressive library service to Leiston and its surrounding villages.
