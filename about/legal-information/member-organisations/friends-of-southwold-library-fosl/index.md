## The story so far

FoSL was established in January 2013 as a small charity to fundraise in support of Southwold Library. Members wanted to keep their library open, raise money to support the running of Southwold Library and, where possible, provide a few enhancements which the library’s budget might not otherwise stretch to.

In the six years since then, we have:

* Provided funds to buy furniture, new moveable bookshelves and a new children's library
* Paid for Wi-Fi, a laminator and a scanner, making new services available for local people
* Sponsored community events run by Southwold Library staff, such as the Harry Potter night for children held in February and the very popular annual crime writers’ festival, Slaughter in Southwold, which takes place in June each year
* Sponsored children's events throughout the summer holidays. In 2019, these included visits from the Mini Monsters, Mr Bean Entertainments, Beach Bonkers and local artist Meraylah Allwood. We also funded visits from organisations such as Sutton Hoo, and paid for materials for children's craft activities run by library staff.

We raise funds through events such as book sales, quiz nights, an annual plant sale & fete, sound & vision sales, coffee mornings and stalls at the Christmas Lights Switch-on, the Southwold Arts Festival, the Lions’ Club fete and more. All of these events are run by Friends. There are lots of opportunities to get involved, help the Library and meet other people who care about the Library. If you are not already a Friend, why not join us? You’ll find a form further down this page.

We also sell a variety of items through the library, including Southwold Library branded bags, pens and water bottles as well as Treasure Trails treasure hunts, USB sticks, craft items and local books.

We have been so successful in its fundraising that we soon exceeded the £5,000 limit on a small charity’s income. In 2015, we registered with the Charity Commission as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation. We became a member of Suffolk Libraries IPS in March 2013; we are very proud to be part of an organisation identified as the gold standard of public libraries by William Sieghart, author of a recent government report on libraries in England.
