Suffolk’s Libraries Industrial and Provident Society Limited is our formally registered name. We call ourselves **Suffolk Libraries**.

We are an [Industrial and Provident Society](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/doing/small_firms/msr/societies), a not for profit, independent and charitable organisation set up in August 2012 to run the service for the benefit of the people of Suffolk. Following the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, such societies are now generally referred to as [‘Registered Societies’](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/registered-societies-introduction/co-operative-community-benefit-societies-act-2014).

All libraries in Suffolk are run by Suffolk Libraries. We're contracted by [Suffolk County Council](http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/) to run the service.

Our membership is drawn from [member organisations](/about/legal-information/member-organisations/), community groups made up of people who want to support their library and have a say in how they are run. Each library in Suffolk works with local people to develop these member organisations.

We run a supporters' scheme, [Suffolk Libraries Extra](/extra/). Individuals and local businesses can make an annual donation if they would like to get more involved and enhance the service we provide. All members of Suffolk Libraries Extra get a membership card and special newsletter, while those who sign up at Platinum level can attend our AGM and are acknowledged in our annual review.

Member organisations elect [our board](/about/legal-information/board-members/).
