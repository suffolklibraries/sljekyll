As an employer with over 250 staff, Suffolk Libraries is required by law to carry out Gender Pay reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) regulations 2017.

On 5 April 2018 we employed 274 permanent staff: 230 females and 44 males. The gender pay gap between men and women was 18.4% compared with 11.2% in 2017.

The full details of our Gender Pay Gap reporting are shown below and the following factors should be taken into account:

* Female staff represent 84% of the whole workforce
* Salary sacrifice schemes reduce the hourly rate paid to a member of staff. Over time more staff have switched to this method, of which 82% are female
* Only full pay relevant employees are included – any staff with unpaid time cannot be included
* The calculations are based on payments from the April 2018 payroll, so the 2018 pay increase has not been taken into account as it was processed in the May payroll
* The majority of staff who are paid the minimum rate of £8.01 per hour are female and this brings down the mean average amongst female staff as there are fewer male staff overall
* However, the median average shows the middle rate for male and female staff is 7.4%, which highlights a greater level of overall equality
* Our change of CEO affected the gap compared to last year as the previous CEO was female and the new one is male
* Based on the top 20 male and female pay rates, the mean gender pay gap is only 1.94%, which shows there is more equality in higher paid roles.

Our Senior Leadership Team is fully committed to focusing on development opportunities across the organisation and especially on enabling all colleagues to fulfil their potential.

For example, in October 2018, we created new Executive Library Manager roles, which have created a more obvious career progression for developing leaders. We are also creating a flexible reward and benefit scheme designed to attract a diverse range of future employees while retaining existing staff.
