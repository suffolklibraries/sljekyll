As an employer with over 250 staff, Suffolk Libraries is required by law to carry out Gender Pay reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) regulations 2017.

On 5 April 2019 Suffolk Libraries employed 286 permanent staff; 235 females and 51 males.  The gender pay gap between men and women was 15.2% compared with 18.4% in 2018.  

The full details of our Gender Pay Gap reporting are shown below and the following factors should be taken into account:

- Female staff represent 86% of the total workforce (an increase on last year)
- Salary sacrifice schemes reduce the hourly rate paid to a member of staff. Over time more staff have switched to this method, of which 70 % are female
- Only full pay relevant employees are included – any staff with unpaid time cannot be included
- The calculations are based on the April 2019 payroll which included the annual pay increase whereas last year it did not as we processed the increase in the May payroll
- The majority of staff who are paid the minimum rate of £8.42 per hour are female and this brings down the mean average amongst female staff as there are fewer male staff overall
- However, the median average shows the middle rate male and female staff is 4.4% which highlights a greater level of overall equality.
- Based on the top 20 male and female pay rates, the mean gender pay gap is negligible which shows there is more equality in higher paid roles.

Our Senior Leadership Team is fully committed to focusing on development opportunities across the organisation and especially on enabling all colleagues to fulfil their potential.

We have created a flexible reward and benefit scheme designed to attract a diverse range of future employees whilst retaining existing staff.
