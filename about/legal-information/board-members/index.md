Among other things, Sally has volunteered at Aldeburgh Independent Community Cinema, as a guide and former trustee of the Britten Pears Foundation at the Red House and as a governor of a local primary school. She has also supported the local carnival.

Sally’s career involved senior strategic planning and policy development in the public sector including local government, health services and professional membership and regulation bodies as well as charities and voluntary organisations.

She has worked in and led organisations ranging from large multi-million pound hospitals and medical colleges to small charities with little money but which punch above their weight, including those dedicated to helping young people experience citizenship. Sally has advocated successfully for organisations with funding challenges and is used to working as part of a team to deliver a common goal.
