## Biographies

### Tony Brown
Tony worked in marketing after graduating from Oxford with a degree in English. He's worked with brands such as Beecham, Perrier and NatWest.

He moved to Suffolk in 1991 when he was appointed director of Management Education by the University of East Anglia. He subsequently held senior academic and management roles at UEA, including dean of Continuing Education, and Business Development director.

He has led successful bids to national and regional funding bodies, and implemented change management programmes with, among others, Virgin and Norfolk Constabulary.

### Peter Callaghan

Peter is a governor at a Brandon primary school and is involved with the school’s literacy and reading programmes. He is interested in developing library activities at a primary level in partnership with the schools’ library service and very keen on investigating the use of new technologies within the library service.

The Friends of Brandon Library have contributed two Chromebooks and a Wi-Fi printer for general use, and these services have proved effective and popular. Peter believes that there is potential for further developments through the use of e-readers linked to the Overdrive system, especially for older and partially sighted people.
<h3>Sylvia Knights</h3>
Sylvia has volunteered her support for many libraries, as well as her local library in Bungay.

She was appointed an interim board member of the IPS in February 2012 and was recently re-elected as a trustee and secretary to the Friends of Bungay Community Library. She helped the friends group achieve CIO registration.

Sylvia is Bungay deputy town mayor and a trustee of Bungay Town Trust.

### Jonathan Ogden

Jonathan is a Kesgrave town councillor and Explorer scout leader, teaching young adults new skills.

He works for a major retailer and is the trustee to Kesgrave Library's friends group.

### Colin Rockall

Colin has been a resident of Lavenham since 2000 and is the current Chairman of Friends of Lavenham Library.

Much of his professional career was spent in local government and during the period between 1985 and 2000 he held the position of District Council Chief Executive – initially with an authority in Surrey and then a council in Somerset.

In 2000, he joined the Audit Commission, followed by a four year period with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) as a Lead Official. In this role, he represented the Department by working to improve ‘failing’ authorities, reporting to Ministers and senior civil servants. When ODPM was disbanded he became, and still is, a self- employed consultant, continuing to work directly to local authorities on performance and improvement issues.

Within Lavenham, Colin undertakes voluntary work, which includes being a Director of the Lavenham Literary Festival since 2009. He is currently Company Secretary.

### Alison Wheeler

Alison is general manager of the IPS. As the chief executive officer she is accountable to the board for the day to day management of the IPS. She's also a member of the IPS Board.

Alison has lived and worked in Suffolk for over 32 years.

She qualified as a librarian in 1979 after studying at the University of Wales (Aberystwyth). Since then she's worked as a children’s librarian, managed branch libraries and eventually became the lead manager for front line services in 2001. In 2003 she introduced Sunday libraries and self service.

Alison has worked at regional and national levels to develop partnerships and profile for public libraries. In the late 1990s she set and led a regional agency for libraries in the East of England, and in 2009 she led the development and signing of a national agreement between the Department of Health and the public library sector.

Most recently Alison spent four years working in Adult Social Care as head of Information and Advice.
