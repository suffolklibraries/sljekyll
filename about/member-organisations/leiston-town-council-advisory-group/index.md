Leiston Library has been re-decorated and re-modelled with new shelves, paint and carpets to make the library more welcoming. This together with our new outside area and coffee and tea to purchase make the library a lovely place to be.

This has all been made possible by generous grants from:

* Leiston and Sizewell Communities Fund
* Enabling Communities Fund
* Leiston Town Council who, as well as giving a grant, support us in so many ways
* Westleton, Knodishall and Aldringham Parish Council

## Fundraising

Library staff, volunteers and the advisory group have been fundraising for the library and have generated funds from Waitrose, craft sales and shortly cards and stamps.

## Future Plans

The future looks bright for our library and we are confident that we will continue to provide an exciting, reliable, relevant and progressive library service to Leiston and its surrounding villages.
