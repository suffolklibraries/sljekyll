## The story so far

We were established in March 2008 to enable the local community to work with Suffolk County Council on the Lottery Funded project to re-build the library, which opened in 2009. Since then a new team of volunteers have taken over the committee and are very active in the library. Voices became a charity in January 2016; registered charity number: 1165302.
