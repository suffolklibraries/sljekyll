* Membership costs £1/year; these funds will go to the library. Any extra donations are always welcome.

## The story so far

​We are all keen library users, working together in an ‘unincorporated association,’ which is a member of Suffolk Libraries IPS. All of us are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM and our monthly meetings, and may also stand in the annual elections for the trustees.

## Future plans

We hold monthly meetings at which every member is welcome. If you want to get involved here's how you can help:

* We’re supporting the Newmarket News ‘Let’s Read’ scheme. To volunteer to help local schoolchildren with their reading, please let us know: the Newmarket News will sort out the paperwork so that you can start asap.
* The Newmarket News will be running a monthly column of news from the library – which library activities do you think should be featured?
* Knitting Club – do you know any keen knitters who would like to meet regularly in the library?
