## The story so far

We are a group of people who all have the same aim; to promote the library and all the services it offers. We're all regular library users, and many of us are involved in the various activities that take place in the library, such as:

* Lowestoft Library Writers' Group
* Lowestoft Library Book Group
* Lowestoft Library Teen Writers
* Summer Reading Challenge

We volunteer wherever we can in order to help the library maintain its status within the town.

## Recent successes

* Held an event on World Book Night on 23 April 2013 which included WBN book givings, fancy dress, quiz, and raffle
* Bi-monthly book sales, kindly donated by members of the public, sold in the library foyer every other month
* Held a craft sale, selling homemade jewellery, cakes, crochet, cards, and original artwork
* Running the Lowestoft Library Literature Festival yearly, where local authors talk about their work, and put on children's events during the festival
