## Contact us

It's simple to become a member and costs a nominal £1 membership fee. If you're interested in joining us, call into the library for an application form for further details.

## The story so far

We're a registered charity (Registered Charity Number 1151649), set up in 2012 as a direct response to the need for a community group to support the library and raise funds for further development. We're made up of a board of trustees and 55 members.

## Recent successes

* Our secretary Sylvia Knights was nominated and voted to the Suffolk’s Libraries IPS board in September 2015, she has also been appointed Vice Chair
* Raised funds to redecorate main library in November 2014
* Installed 3 additional public computers for free customer use
* Jointly purchased a Harold Steggles Shell advertisement poster on behalf of the town, now displayed within the Library.
* Welcomed Louis de Bernières as our new patron
* Increased our range of greetings cards to compensate for the recent closure of Lodge Cordell and the Post Office

## Future plans
