## The story so far

Friends of Ixworth Library (FOIL) was set up in 2013 to support the library in this beautiful and historical village. We have been fundraising to support and improve the service the library provides to the community.

FOIL was set up in 2013 following the creation of Suffolk Libraries IPS to help support the library in Ixworth. The main criteria was to raise funds for the (now defunct) community contribution. But once the pressure eased and this was disregarded, FOIL decided to raise funds to support the service staff provide.

To date they have helped buy equipment ranging from the new colour printer to new trolleys for the For Sale books to smaller items for displaying books.

The committee has also supported the library when it held a Harry Potter Day, by funding a book token as a first prize during the ‘Design a Wizard’s Hat’ competition.

In January 2015, FOIL launched a weekly art group that meets when the library is closed. A new table was purchased for the members to use. The art group has been an enormous success, giving members of the community somewhere to come and meet like-minded individuals, practice techniques, learn from each other and make new friends.

In April 2015, the art group started displaying their pieces of work to the public in the library with a view to selling them to raise further funds for FOIL.

## Future plans

FOIL is looking to expand the use of the library during the hours it is closed by potentially setting up classes and clinics aimed at older people who would like to learn how to use computers, tablets and digital devices.

The group would also like to fund eReaders for customers to borrow - a scheme which is being piloted elsewhere in the county’s libraries.

The committee is keen to forge links with the local schools to encourage literacy in children and young people.

They continue to support the staff in all their endeavours, and for that they have their deep thanks.
