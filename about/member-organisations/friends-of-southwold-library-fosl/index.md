## The story so far

*FoSL’s third birthday cake*

FoSL was established in January 2013 as a small charity to fundraise in support of Southwold Library. Members wanted to keep their library open, raise money to support the running of Southwold Library and, where possible, provide a few enhancements which the library’s budget might not otherwise stretch to.

In the three years since then, FoSL has:

* provided funds to buy chairs, tables and bookshelves for Southwold Library
* paid for wifi, a printer and scanner, making new services available to the public in Southwold Library
* sponsored community events run by Southwold Library staff, such as the Harry Potter night for children held in February and the very popular annual crime writers’ festival, Slaughter in Southwold, which takes place in June each year

Funds are raised through events such as book sales, quiz nights, the annual plant sale, the sound and vision sale, coffee mornings and stalls at the Christmas Lights Switch-on, the Southwold Arts Festival, the Lions’ Club fete and more. All of these events are run by Friends. There are lots of opportunities to get involved, help the Library and meet other people who care about the Library. If you are not already a Friend, why not join us? You’ll find a form further down this page.

FoSL has been so successful in its fundraising that it soon exceeded the £5,000 limit on a small charity’s income. In 2015 FoSL registered with the Charity Commission as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation. FoSL became a member of Suffolk Libraries IPS in March 2013; we are very proud to be part of an organisation identified as the gold standard of public libraries by William Sieghart, author of a recent government report on libraries in England.
