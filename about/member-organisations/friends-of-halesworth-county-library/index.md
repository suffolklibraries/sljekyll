## The story so far

The Friends of Halesworth County Library was established in 2013 and registered with the Charity Commission in September of that year as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Registered Charity Number 1153765). This is a community group to support the library and raise funds for further development. We now have almost 400 members.

The Friends is an 'open' organisation where all members are encouraged to bring forward ideas or suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the group and its contribution to the Library and the community. The group's aim is to support the manager, staff and volunteers of the Library in their delivery of a comprehensive library system.

As well as our members we have a group of Trustees of the Friends who meet regularly with the library manager. Their role is to give support and advice on meeting the expenses involved in making improvements to the library and also in purchasing new equipment for the use of library members. For example, we were able to purchase some iPads this year and these can be borrowed from the library. This is a very exciting development and Halesworth is the first library in Suffolk to offer such a service.

In co-operation with library staff, the Friends organise two kinds of events:

* Some are to raise money for the 'extras' which will help to make the library a more welcoming community resource as well as a place to find books and information.
* Others offer members of the local community a range of low cost activities designed to entertain and educate, or just for fun and companionship! Some combine all four aims!

Friends, through their support of the library, have helped great things to happen!

* Wheeled shelving for the book stock was purchased to replace some of the downstairs shelving. So now the downstairs area can be opened up, as needed, for special events.
* The library has been totally re-decorated. It was in need of freshening up and looks so much better now. The final painting was completed at the end of September and new carpeting has now been laid throughout.
* The next project has already been costed and will be completed soon – blinds for the upstairs. And that's not the end of it! We have really exciting plans for the staircase. Watch out for more news!

Much of this would not have happened without the support of the Friends and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all Friends AND supporters for their contributions.
