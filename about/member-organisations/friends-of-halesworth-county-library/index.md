## Get involved with the Friends

Are you passionate about our library services? Would you like to be more involved in what happens within Halesworth Library, supporting it in the face of gradually reducing central funding? If so, we are always looking for new Friends to join us.

Maybe you already support us as a library user, but by becoming a Friend you could do more. Your involvement can be as little or as much as you like. As a Friend, you can simply be an advocate of the library, but you can also have a say in what we do to support the library through the charity and contribute ideas to shape the library for the future.

You could, for instance, join our events group, which plans and runs fundraising events throughout the year. Or maybe you have a talent or skill that you could share by running groups in the library. You may wish to volunteer within the library or just help with publicity through your town/village newsletters, putting up posters or spreading the word through social media.

If this is of interest to you, please complete the membership application form below, or pick up a paper copy in the library.

Many Friends like to donate to the charity when joining and if you would like to do the same, please either make an electronic payment to 40-23-04 81263528 quoting 'donation' as the reference, or use the form below.

Hard copies of all the forms should be returned to: Halesworth Library, Bridge Street, Halesworth, IP19 8AD.

## The story so far

The Friends of Halesworth County Library was established in 2013 and registered with the Charity Commission in September of that year as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Registered Charity Number 1153765). This is a community group to support the library and raise funds for further development. We now have almost 400 members.

The Friends is an 'open' organisation where all members are encouraged to bring forward ideas or suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the group and its contribution to the library and the community. The group's aim is to support the manager, staff and volunteers of the library in their delivery of a comprehensive library system.

As well as our members we have a group of Trustees of the Friends who meet regularly with the library manager. Their role is to give support and advice on meeting the expenses involved in making improvements to the library and also in purchasing new equipment for the use of library members.

In co-operation with library staff, the Friends organise two kinds of events:

* Some are to raise money for the 'extras' which will help to make the library a more welcoming community resource as well as a place to find books and information.
* Others offer members of the local community a range of low cost activities designed to entertain and educate, or just for fun and companionship! Some combine all four aims!

Friends, through their support of the library, have helped great things to happen to the library!

* Wheeled shelving for the book stock was purchased to replace some of the downstairs shelving. So now the downstairs area can be cleared, as needed, for special events.
* The library has been totally re-decorated. It needed freshening up and looks so much better now. New carpeting was laid throughout and, for the first time, we have blinds for the mezzanine. These make it possible to reduce the bright light from the large windows when presentations are being given. The blinds also make the area cosier during the winter and can provide an element of privacy and noise control when activities are happening both downstairs and on the mezzanine.
* A new project is being costed and planned for 2017 - refurbishment of the Junior Library.

Much of this would not have happened without the support of the Friends and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all Friends AND supporters for their contributions.
