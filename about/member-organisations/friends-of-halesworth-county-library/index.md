## Get involved with the Friends

Are you passionate about our library services? Would you like to feel more involved in what happens within Halesworth Library, supporting it in the face of gradually reducing central funding? If so, we are always looking for new Friends.

Maybe you already support us as a library user. As a Friend you could do more and your involvement can be as little or as much as you like. By simply signing up as a Friend, you become an advocate for the library and part of a visible group of supporters.

You can also become more involved and have a bigger say in how the library is supported by the Friends group. You can contribute your own ideas to help shape the library for the future.

You might, for instance, join our events group, which plans and runs fundraising events throughout the year. Or maybe you have a talent or skill that you could share by running groups in the library.

You may wish to volunteer within the library (regularly or occasionally) or just help with publicity through your town/village newsletters, putting up posters or spreading the word through social media.

If you'd like to join us, please complete the **membership application** form below, or pick up a paper copy in the library.

Membership is free, but **we appreciate donations**. You can make an electronic payment to 40-23-04 81263528 quoting 'donation' as the reference, use the form below, or simply pop into the library with cash or a cheque.

Hard copies of all the forms should be returned to: Halesworth Library, Bridge Street, Halesworth, IP19 8AD.

## The story so far

The Friends of Halesworth County Library was established in 2013 and registered with the Charity Commission that September as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Registered Charity Number 1153765). This is a community group to support the library and raises funds for further development. We now have over 400 members.

The Friends is an 'open' organisation where all members are encouraged to bring forward ideas or suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the group and its contribution to the library and the community. The group's aim is to support the manager, staff and volunteers of the library in their delivery of a comprehensive library system.

As well as our members we have a group of Trustees of the Friends who meet with the library manager every six weeks. Their role is to give support and advice on meeting the expenses involved in making improvements to the library and in purchasing new equipment for the use of library members.

In co-operation with library staff, the Friends organise two kinds of events:

* Fundraisers for the 'extras' which help to make the library a welcoming community resource as well as a place to find books and information.
* A range of free and low-cost activities for the local community designed to entertain and educate, or just for fun and companionship. Some combine all four of these aims!

Friends' support has helped great things to happen for the library:

* Our latest project, completed in July 2017, was the refurbishment of the Junior Library. The Friends paid for around 75% of this.
* We purchased wheeled shelving for the book stock to replace some of the downstairs shelving. Now the downstairs area can be cleared for special events.
* We paid for the library to be redecorated. We had new carpeting laid throughout and bought blinds for the mezzanine. These reduce sunlight during presentations, make the area cosier during the winter, provide an element of privacy and reduce noise.

Much of the above works would not have happened without the support of the Friends and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all Friends AND supporters for their contributions.

## Achievements and successes

Below is just a sample of the things we have achieved since we were established in 2013.

### Fundraising

We have:
* Regular sales in the library.
* An annual plant sale in front of the library with support from the Halesworth Millennium Green Trust.
* Stalls at the Halesworth Antiques Street Market from 2014.
* Established a 100 Club - new members welcome!
* Weekly laptop and iPad support sessions with all proceeds benefitting the library.
* Secured funding from Holton Parish Council, Blyford and Sotherton Parish Council and Halesworth Town Council.

### Purchases

* Mobile wheeled shelving, enabling the library to host a wider range of events.
* Full redecoration, new carpeting and blinds.
* We were the first Suffolk library to purchase iPads for loan.
* Installation of Wi-Fi in the library.
* Small enhancements such as a gazebo, banners and Christmas decorations.

### Events

* A wonderful children's event with former Children's Laureate Chris Riddell in 2015.
* Exciting science activities with Kinetic Adventure in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
* A celebration of the 20th anniversary of the library's relocation to Bridge Street in 2016, featuring magic shows for children and adults.
* Popular quiz nights each spring and autumn.
* Monthly afternoon board games from October to June since 2015.
* Half-term activities for school-age children.
* Christmas events.

### Ongoing plans

During 2017 we organised a successful drive to encourage more people to become Friends. We will continue to hold a regular stall to promote our work.

Having developed great facilities for our younger customers, we are currently considering:
* How we might provide facilities and activities to help young adults get more out of the library.
* How to help elderly library members who find it hard to get to the library.
