## Who are we?

We are local people who use [Woodbridge Library](/branches/woodbridge-library) in a wide variety of ways. We provide practical support to the library and promote it to the Woodbridge community.

## Why should you join the Friends of Woodbridge Library?

If you are interested in the library and would like to do more to help it flourish in these times of budget austerity, the Friends of Woodbridge Library (FOWL) provides the opportunity to do so.

We promote interesting events,  raise funds for library programme enhancement and we co-operate with and support the hard-working and talented Woodbridge Library staff in much of what it does.

## Who can become a Friend of the Library?

Anyone aged 16 or older who has a Suffolk Libraries card and is a user of the Woodbridge Library is eligible to join FOWL. There is no membership fee or dues to pay.

## The back story

During 2011 long-term sharp cutbacks in central government funding for public libraries stimulated Suffolk County Council, which operated 44 libraries, to form Suffolk Libraries Industrial and Private Society (IPS) Ltd, a new non-profit corporation to take over the funding and management of the libraries.

The goal was to save all of the libraries from closure while reducing costs by 25%, and continuing to provide stable core financing. In order to enhance and strengthen community involvement, each local library was asked to organise a volunteer group similar to the Friends of Woodbridge Library. We organised formally in April 2013.

## What does FOWL do?

We work closely with library staff to help to organise and run a very wide range of community activities. So far these have included:

	* Table top sales
	* Lunch time concerts
	* Jazz evening
	* Poetry readings
	* Craft fairs
	* Art classes
	* Summer Reading Game presentation
	* Writing groups

## What we don’t do!
Our role is to be helpful in many ways, but we are not the library’s governing body. That role is in the able hands of Suffolk Libraries IPS Limited, which manages the 44 libraries, and employs the libraries’ staff.

Suffolk Libraries is governed by a board of directors elected at its AGM, and FOWL has a voting representative at all general meetings.

## What has been achieved so far?

Since its formation in the spring of 2013, FOWL has sponsored or organised dozens of projects and programmes at the library.

Some of these have been fundraisers; others have been educational and recreational events. The library’s outreach has been strengthened, and library staff have welcomed the support and assistance of FOWL members and volunteers in many areas.

## Where does the money go?

FOWL is organised as a small charity. All money donated to FOWL and raised through its fundraising efforts is held in an account at Lloyd’s Bank in Woodbridge.

During its first year from April 2013 through March 2014, we received a total of £3,166 and spent £414. The current year’s income will be similar; our spending, however, has sharply increased. Amongst the notable expenses has been our participation in the Woodbridge Carnival (where our promotional float garnered first prize!), as well as the purchase of:

	* A speaker system for any group to borrow
	* A new photocopier/scanner/scanner has been purchased for library and public use
	* 24 used stacking chairs for lectures, concerts, and other events
	* A computer projector available for any group to borrow

## Our library and the future

The long-term future of the library and the other public libraries in Suffolk appears to be secure under the ownership and leadership of Suffolk Libraries IPS Ltd.

Stable funding appears to be assured from Suffolk County Council, assuming that central government does not impose further cuts.

What the Friends of Woodbridge Library can do, and are helping to do on behalf of the larger Woodbridge community, is to strengthen the library’s offerings, to increase the appreciation and use of the library, and to demonstrate that public libraries are a vital public service that merits continued public finance.
