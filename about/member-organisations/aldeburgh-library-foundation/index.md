## Our aims

Aldeburgh Library Foundation’s vision is for a knowledge hub at the heart of the community, in which reading, learning and sharing knowledge can help to shape the town’s future well-being. Our aims are:

* To advance the education of the general public in Aldeburgh, Suffolk and the surrounding area, in particular but not exclusively by the provision of a lending library.

* To further or benefit the residents of Aldeburgh, Suffolk and the neighbourhood, regardless sex, sexual orientation, race or political opinion.

## Who we are

Our directors are:

* Chair: Lynne Walker
* David Grugeon
* Hugo Herbert-Jones
* Celia Leggett
* Tony Richards

The library manager attends Board meetings ex officio. Our Board is currently advised by Tony Bone and Mike Kiff, who also attend meetings.
