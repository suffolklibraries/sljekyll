  text="My 8 year old is autistic, so he reads a lot and quickly. My son loves to go through the books. There are always themed books on display and if I want to get the kids out, it’s a nice walk… My family has also used the library at times to look for work and my mum uses the computers and the printing services. It’s a space for everybody. – <cite>Sarelle Payne, Woodbridge Library customer</cite>"

  text="Growing up, it felt like the only way for the economically disadvantaged to get educated. You could get a book on history or politics… I bring my grandchildren here and we’ll all choose some books together. I will come in sometimes just to have a look and speak to the staff here. It’s a good place to come in and have a chat. – <cite>Dennis Stevens, Stowmarket Library customer</cite>"

I can reserve as many as I want, free of charge.” But Angie doesn’t just use the library service for books: “I’ve brought my daughter to the baby sessions. My younger daughter does the Summer Reading Challenge. I’ve even attended a knit and natter group.” – <cite>Angle Lee-Foster , Framlingham Library customer</cite>"

They set up a wedding venue, ran a slime workshop, set up fundraising initiatives, read with children taking part in the Summer Reading Challenge and organised an afternoon tea in support of mental health awareness. “The management here is lovely, they welcomed us with open arms. Every suggestion was taken on board. They’re so eager to have volunteers.”. – <cite>Brandon and Matilda, Ipswich County Library volunteers</cite>"
