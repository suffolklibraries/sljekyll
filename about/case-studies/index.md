  title="It’s a space for everybody"
  text="My 8 year old is autistic, so he reads a lot and quickly. My son loves to go through the books. There are always themed books on display and if I want to get the kids out, it’s a nice walk… My family has also used the library at times to look for work and my mum uses the computers and the printing services. It’s a space for everybody. – <cite>Sarelle Payne, Woodbridge Library customer</cite>"

  title="I bring my grandchildren here"
  text="Growing up, it felt like the only way for the economically disadvantaged to get educated. You could get a book on history or politics… I bring my grandchildren here and we’ll all choose some books together. I will come in sometimes just to have a look and speak to the staff here. It’s a good place to come in and have a chat. – <cite>Dennis Stevens, Stowmarket Library customer</cite>"

I can reserve as many as I want, free of charge.” But Angie doesn’t just use the library service for books: “I’ve brought my daughter to the baby sessions. My younger daughter does the Summer Reading Challenge. I’ve even attended a knit and natter group.” – <cite>Angle Lee-Foster , Framlingham Library customer</cite>"
