excerpt: '<a href="http://shakespeareweek.org.uk/">Shakespeare Week</a> runs from 14-20 March. Take a look at how the Bard has influenced books, film and music until the modern day.'
---
His influence is everywhere. If you&#8217;ve ever been &#8220;in a pickle&#8221;, waited &#8220;with bated breath&#8221; or gone on &#8220;a wild goose chase&#8221;, then you’ve been quoting from <cite>The Tempest</cite>, <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite> and <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> respectively.

If you “gossip”, the word comes from <cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>. &#8220;The be-all and end-all&#8221; is uttered by Macbeth, and &#8220;fair play&#8221; comes from Miranda in <cite>The Tempest</cite>. &#8220;A heart of gold&#8221;? No, not Neil Young, you’ll find it in <cite>Henry V</cite>, while “the world’s mine oyster” is in <cite>The Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>. Elvis Presley in <cite>Are you Lonesome Tonight</cite> says &#8220;someone said the world’s a stage&#8221;. Yes, that was him too, from <cite>As You Like It</cite>.

In honour of the Bard and his influence on popular culture, here are some popular works that owe a debt to the Bard.

## [<cite>The Lion King</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/413747?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9673562)&QRYTEXT=The%20lion%20king%20%5Bvideorecording%5D)

      <cite>The Lion King</cite> has marked similarities with Shakespeare&#8217;s <cite>Hamlet</cite>. Simba&#8217;s uncle Scar kills Mufasa to become King, then a grown-up Simba seeks vengeance on Scar, after seeing a vision of his father&#8217;s ghost, of course. And don&#8217;t forget the comical Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-esque Timon and Pumbaa.

      Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) can’t date Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) until her shrewish older sister Katherina (Julia Stiles) dates, so they set her up with bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger). Bianca is Bianca, Katherina is Katherina, Patrick is Petruchio, and Cameron is Lucentio — Cameron even disguises himself as a language tutor, just as Lucentio does in <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>. I don’t recall Shakespeare writing ‘the s*** hath hitteth the fan’ though..

      Dora and Nora Chance are a famous song-and-dance team of the British music halls. Billed as The Lucky Chances, the sisters are the illegitimate and unacknowledged daughters of Sir Melchoir Hazard, the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day. The book is written in five chapters just as a Shakespearian play often had five acts.

      Perhaps not one for the purists. Shakespeare&#8217;s story of doomed love is transposed to the world of the suburban front lawn as lovestruck garden gnomes Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) find themselves caught up in a feud between the next-door neighbours to whom they belong. Can they find a way to be together despite the many everyday garden obstacles that stand in their way?
