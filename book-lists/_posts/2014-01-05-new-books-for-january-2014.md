Hidden in a soldier&#8217;s tin box are a painting, a pocket watch, and a dance card – keepsakes of three lives.

It is 1914. George Farrell cycles through the tranquil Cumberland fells to deliver a letter, unaware that it will change his life.

George has fallen for the rich and beautiful daughter at the Manor House, Miss Violet, but when she lets slip the contents of the letter George is heartbroken to find that she is already promised to another man.

George escapes his heartbreak by joining the patriotic rush to war, but his past is not so easily avoided. His rite of passage into adulthood leaves him believing that no woman will be able to love the man he has become.

New title from the author of the best–selling Lewis Trilogy.

When Detective Sime Mackenzie boards a light aircraft at Montreal&#8217;s St. Hubert airfield, he does so without looking back. For Sime, the journey ahead represents an opportunity to escape the bitter blend of loneliness and regret that has come to characterise his life in the city.

Travelling as part of an investigation team, Sime&#8217;s destination lies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Only two kilometres wide and three long, Entry Island is home to a population of around 130: the wealthiest of which has just been discovered murdered.

Two entwined families: the aristocratic Inghams and the Swanns who serve them. One stately home: Cavendon Hall, a grand imposing house nestled in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. Two best friends: DeLacy Ingham, daughter of the earl, and Ceci Swann, daughter of the valet. Inseparable from childhood, but with two very different destinies.

But the year is 1913, and soon life as the two families of Cavendon Hall know it – Royal Ascot, supper dances, grouse season feasts – is about to change irrevocably.

Former MP and sometime author (as Louise Bagshawe) Louise Mensch returns to her day job as a bestselling writer.

There isn&#8217;t a woman on earth who doesn&#8217;t have her beauty secrets. But for Dina Kane, beauty is more than just business. It&#8217;s power. And it is the secret.

She&#8217;s dragged herself up from poverty to Park Avenue. She&#8217;s rolled with the punches. And she&#8217;s learned how to win. Now someone is out to destroy her, and all she&#8217;s built. They&#8217;ve underestimated Dina Kane. She&#8217;s staying at the top – and she&#8217;s happy to wait for the perfect moment to exact her revenge.
