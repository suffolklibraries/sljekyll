<blockquote>
  <p>“Nicola Morgan’s accessible and humourous examination of the ups and downs of the teenage brain deals with powerful emotions, the need for more sleep, the urge to take risks, the difference between genders, the reasons behind addiction and depression, and what lies ahead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="mind-your-head-by-juno-dawson-dr-olivia-hewitt--gemma-correll"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1896983"><cite>Mind Your Head</cite>, by Juno Dawson, Dr Olivia Hewitt &amp; Gemma Correll</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We all have a mind, so we all need to take care of our mental health as much as we need to take care of our physical health. And the first step is being able to talk about our mental health.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Juno Dawson leads the way with this frank, factual and funny book, with added information and support from clinical psychologist Dr Olivia Hewitt. Covering topics from anxiety and depression to addiction, self-harm and personality disorders, Juno and Olivia talk clearly and supportively about a range of issues facing young people’s mental health - whether fleeting or long-term - and how to manage them, with real-life stories from young people around the world.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Each of us has thoughts that are painful at times; sometimes the pain is sadness, sometimes worry or anger or shame or grief or some feeling that you don’t even have words for. If you are a young person struggling with your emotions, you do not want to be told that ‘everyone feels like that’ or that ‘you will grow out of it’. You want to feel that your emotions are valid and that the person offering help truly understands how painful life can feel at times.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With a strong emphasis on validation and compassion, <cite>Stuff That Sucks</cite> encourages you to accept your emotions rather than struggling against them. It also shows how to reconnect with what is really important to you, giving you the tools to help clarify your personal values and take steps towards living a life where those values can guide you in your day-to-day behaviour.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This guide contains everything you really want to know, but are too embarrassed to ask your teachers, from ‘how do I know if I’m healthy?’ to ‘what’s it like to take drugs?’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Self-Esteem Team won’t tell you that if you have sex you’ll definitely get an STI and die, but they will help you decide if you’re ready. They won’t tell you never to watch porn, but they will help you decipher what you see. They won’t ask you not to embrace fashion, fitness or beauty, but they will give you the info you need to rock your own brand of gorgeous.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We all know that growing up is hard to do, and sometimes the only thing that makes it better are the reassuring words of someone who has walked that bumpy road just a few steps ahead of you and somehow ended up as a fully-functioning adult.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thanks to her phenomenally popular YouTube videos, Carrie Hope Fletcher has become an ‘honourary big sister’ to hundreds of thousands of young people who turn to her for advice, friendship and, most of all, the knowledge that things will get better. Part memoir, part advice guide, this book includes Carrie’s thoughts on some of the topics she’s asked about most regularly: bullying, body image, relationships and perhaps the scariest question of all: what does the future hold for me?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book is part mystery, part adventure. The mystery is working out who you truly are, and the adventure comes in planning the kind of life you really want to lead. From body image and bullying to love, sex and more, plus expert advice on silencing your inner voice of doom, it is an invaluable guide to living a happy life.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are there practical things you can do to stop being bullied - at home, at school and online? What are frenemies and how can you deal with them? How can you learn to make friends and respect yourself? This guide will tell you what bullying is, where it happens, and what you can do about it.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone knows how difficult it can be to keep overwhelming feelings like anxiety, anger, and fear under control, but many forget that these emotions are amplified even more during the teenage years, when healthy coping mechanisms have not fully developed and tumultuous relationships with family and friends are of primary importance.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book is divided into three sections: Section one explains what stress is and looks at the ways teenage stress is different.
