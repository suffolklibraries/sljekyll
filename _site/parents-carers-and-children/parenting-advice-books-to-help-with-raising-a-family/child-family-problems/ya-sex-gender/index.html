<blockquote>
  <p>“Being a girl is not all sugar and spice. How can you possibly survive school and even think about talking to your crush when you have spots in places you didn’t even know you had, your boobs are too big (or too small) and the friend drama is off the charts? Luckily, Hayley Long provides a straight-talking guide to puberty - from cattiness to kisses, and everything in between.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sexting, virginity, consent, the big O…let’s face it, doing it can be tricksy. I don’t know anyone (including myself) who has sex all figured out. So I’ve written a book full of honest, hilarious (and sometimes awkward) anecdotes, confessions and revelations. And because none of us have all the answers, I’ve invited some friends and fellow YouTubers to talk about their sexuality, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We talk about doing it safely. Doing it joyfully. Doing it when you’re ready. Not doing it. Basically, doing it the way you want, when you want.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Teens can often find sex very difficult to navigate. Maybe the time is now, maybe it’s years away. No matter what, they need to be ready both in their minds and bodies. All teens have questions and they can’t always ask their parents and friends for answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thankfully ‘The Sex Lady’ breaks it down in <cite>Doing it Right</cite>, which deals with issues like STIs, birth control and being emotionally ready. The more teens know and understand about the issues surrounding sex, the easier it is for them to make safe, smart and satisfying decisions about their sexuality.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mae Martin is a Canadian comedian with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry Potter trivia. Aside from this, if there’s one area that she’s 100% anecdotally and personally qualified to tackle, it’s sexuality: should there be any such thing as a ‘sexuality spectrum’, then Mae has probably existed at every point on it at some stage in her life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book is Mae’s attempt to demystify sexuality by narrating her own often humiliating adventures in sex, dating and gender identity.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The whole concept of gender identity is being increasingly challenged and words such as non-binary, pansexual, transgender, cisgender and gender dysphoria are becoming commonplace. This book explores the cultures and people of the past who have embraced, challenged or quietly subverted society’s expectations about gender. It features the current stories of openly transgender people around the world in positions of power and authority, who are helping to increase recognition and acceptance of the trans community.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Author and photographer Susan Kuklin met and interviewed six transgender or gender-neutral young adults and used her considerable skills to represent them thoughtfully and respectfully before, during, and after their personal acknowledgment of gender identity.

<blockquote>
  <p>“A funny, sad and serious memoir, <cite>How to Be Happy</cite> is David Burton’s story of his turbulent life at high school and beyond. He longs to have a girlfriend, but his first date is a disaster. There’s the catastrophe of the school swimming carnival and friendships that take devastating turns. Then he finds some solace in drama classes with the creation of ‘Crazy Dave’, and he builds a life where everything is fine. But everything is not fine. And, at the centre of it all, trying desperately to work it all out, is the real David.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Being a teenager is difficult enough, but having to go through puberty whilst realising you’re in the wrong body means dealing with a whole new set of problems: bullying, self-doubt and in some cases facing a physical and medical transition.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Alex is an ordinary teenager: he likes pugs, donuts, retro video games and he sleeps with his socks on. He’s also transgender, and was born female. He’s been living as a male for the past few years and he has recently started his physical transition. Throughout this book, Alex will share what it means to be in his shoes, as well as his personal advice to other trans teens.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Queer author and activist Sarah Prager delves deep into the lives of 23 people who fought, created, and loved on their own terms. From high-profile figures like Abraham Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt to the trailblazing gender-ambiguous Queen of Sweden and a bisexual blues singer who didn’t make it into your history books, these astonishing true stories uncover a rich queer heritage that encompasses every culture, in every era.”</p>
