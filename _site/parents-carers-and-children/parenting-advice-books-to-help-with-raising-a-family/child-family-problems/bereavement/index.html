<blockquote>
  <p>“This is a beautifully told, poignant story about memory, remembrance, and how those we love live on in us. The thought-provoking story centres on a little girl who has a pencil dog as a companion. Pencil Dog is imaginative, creative, and always able to turn a rainy day into a time of sunshine.

<blockquote>
  <p>“At the bottom of Syd’s garden, through the gate and past the tree, is Grandad’s house. Syd can let himself in any time he likes. But one day when Syd comes to call, Grandad isn’t in any of the usual places. He’s in the attic, where he ushers Syd through a door, and the two of them journey to a wild, beautiful island awash in colour where Grandad decides he will remain. So Syd hugs Grandad one last time and sets sail for home. Visiting Grandad’s house at the bottom of the garden again, he finds it just the same as it’s always been - except that Grandad isn’t there anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sure to provide comfort to young children struggling to understand loss, Benji Davies’s tale is a sensitive and beautiful reminder that our loved ones live on in our memories long after they’re gone.”</p>

  <p>“When Albie’s mum dies, it’s natural he should wonder where she’s gone. His parents are both scientists and they usually have all the answers. Dad mutters something about Albie’s mum being alive and with them in a parallel universe. So Albie finds a box, his mum’s computer and a rotting banana, and sends himself through time and space to find her.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dak’s dad has been dead for seven days when suddenly he reappears. He’s the same in almost every way, with one startling exception: Dad has turned into a clownfish, and now lives in a tank at their local aquarium. Dak is delighted by the news - he has Dad back, even if he isn’t quite as he was before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Deciding to keep Dad’s transformation a secret, Dak visits him at the aquarium as often as he can, and ends up spending so much time there that they offer him a job. This is how he comes to meet Violet, the owner’s prickly but kindhearted niece; when the aquarium is threatened with closure, the pair must work together to save it. For Dak, the stakes couldn’t be higher - after all, if the aquarium shuts down, what will happen to the fish?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Life hasn’t been easy recently for David. His father died just a couple of years ago, he has a fractious relationship with his mum, and has fallen out with his best friend. But David has a secret, which he hasn’t told anyone: he has superpowers. He can soar through the air, he has superhearing, he feels and hears everything super-keenly. So life should be easier, then, shouldn’t it?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The monster showed up just after midnight. But it isn’t the monster Conor’s been expecting. He’s been expecting the one from his nightmare, the one he’s had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his back garden, though, this monster, is something different. Something ancient, something wild.”</p>
