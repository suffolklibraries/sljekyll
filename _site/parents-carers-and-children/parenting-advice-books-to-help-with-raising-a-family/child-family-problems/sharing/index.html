<blockquote>
  <p>“This romping rhyming story from award-winning author Jeanne Willis is all about a little rhino who likes to make the rules! When Rhino finds a tree bursting with fruit, he isn’t about to share it with anyone - after all, he’s in charge round here! But it looks like things are about to change.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A nice old grandma bakes a pie, but - oh me, oh my! - that yummy treat is stolen by a greedy fox, then lost and found by a mouse, snatched by a cat, grabbed by a dog, and plucked away by an owl, before landing back on Grandma’s table for everyone to share, or maybe not…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Bear and Hare try to reach some juicy pears, they realise they need some help. Hare finds three chairs but is it fair that Hare has two chairs and Bear only one? When they have the same, Hare still can’t reach the pears! So a little friend teaches them that fair isn’t always everyone getting the same thing - with hilarious results!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A beautifully simple picture book that considers, what is fair? The answer is not always as simple as you’d think!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Five goofy, greedy elephants are up against five teeny-tiny mice in this picture book parable for modern times. One day, deep in the jungle, five elephants discover a new tree - a tall tree - and, atop that tree, the most mouth-wateringly delicious fruit any of them had ever seen. ‘MINE!’ each elephant cries. ‘Mine, mine, mine, mine, MINE!’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But who will get there first? And will the elephants spot the five tiny mice, planning and plotting, slowly approaching that tip-top branch?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bear and Hare have gone for a walk, but every nice thing they find on the way, Hare wants all for himself. He even gobbles up a lovely ice cream without offering a bite to his best friend. Can Bear teach Hare how to share?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Amy snuggles on her blankie with her three toys. ‘I love you all,’ she says, ‘because we’re together, and because you’re MINE.’ When Jack and Zak want to play and they grab Bear and Bunny, Amy grabs them back. ‘MINE!’ she says. When Baby Jo picks up Bird and kisses it, Amy takes it away. ‘MINE!’ she says.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But then she realises that what she’s done has made Baby Jo very sad. He’s all alone, without a toy, and suddenly Amy has a difficult decision to make. What will she do?”</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One ‘thing’ between two characters? How is that going to work? Follow Horse and Fox as they eventually learn that playing together is best.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ping and Pong are a pair of penguins who love to do new things.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Greedy squirrels Cyril and Bruce both have their sights on a very special prize: THE VERY LAST NUT OF THE SEASON! As the nut bounces crazily though the forest, the squirrels race after it, between the trees, over boulders, down the river and - ARGH! - right to the edge of a waterfall! Working together might be the only way to save themselves now…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What happens when you want something so badly that you forget why you wanted it in the first place? Join yellow duck, white duck, red duck - ducks of every colour - as they discover how much more fun their pond is when they stop worrying about who owns it, and start sharing and playing in it together instead. Until a hippopotomus appears.”</p>
