<blockquote>
  <p>“With a new baby in the family, no one pays much attention to Frances any more, at least that is what she thinks. So Frances decides to run away. Not too far, just far enough so that she can hear how much she’ll be missed, even by baby Gloria.”</p>

  <p>“King Baby is gracious - bestowing smiles on his public, allowing tickles and hugs, and posing for photo after adorable photo. But this teeny tiny royal ruler also has many demands, and when his faithful subjects can’t quite keep up, King Baby must take matters into his own hands.”</p>
