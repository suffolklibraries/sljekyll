<p>This looks to be another darkly hilarious hit from the team behind <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2349536"><cite>Supertato</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ned the knight always does exactly what he’s told. When his parents ask him to pick up his toys, dig up the cabbages or go to bed on time, he does it all with a smile. And when the dragon swoops into town every night, he always runs inside just as he’s asked.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But one morning, instead of saying, “yes,” he says, “NO!” He will NOT help his dad find his shield, his arrow or his bow, and he will certainly NOT let the butcher go past. That night, he refuses to go inside, and in doing so he confronts the dragon, making a very unlikely friend.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is on the recommended list for the 2018 Mischief Makers Summer Reading Challenge.</p>

It’s neck and neck for Fergus and Daisy after the Keirin and the road race - and with just one race to go, tensions in the team are riding high.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Running a team of crime-fighting superheroes is a complicated business - especially when your mum’s not allowed to know that you’re doing it. But Murph Cooper is making it work: he’s a schoolkid by day and a member of the top-secret Heroes’ Alliance by night. Not that anyone at The School seems to care. Most of Murph’s teachers and classmates still believe that unless you have a proper superpower you can’t be a real hero.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But his achievements have caught the attention of at least one person. Far away in a maximum security prison, the world’s most notorious supervillain, Magpie, has just broken a 30-year silence.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Finn has always been different, and in the tiny fishing village of Stromhead he sticks out like a sore thumb. Always told to keep away from the water, he’s felt that something was missing until one day he dives in and finds that, swimming with the dolphins, he feels completely at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But his new friends are in danger of being injured by the rubbish that floats out into the water - and now a supermarket is going to release thousands of balloons that could drift out to sea and cause even more damage. Desperate to help the dolphins, Finn goes to the Lighthouse Crew, a group of kids who have always left Finn out. Will they be able to set aside their differences to save the dolphins? And what will Finn discover about his past along the way?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fictionalised tale of the dangers of discarded plastic to our marine life is very topical in the wake of <cite>Blue Planet 2</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Max is used to spending time alone - it’s difficult to make friends in a big, chaotic school when you’re deaf. He prefers to give his attention to the little things in life - like making awesome, detailed replica models.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then Mr Darrow, the school caretaker and fellow modeller, goes missing. Max must follow his parting instruction: ‘Go to my room. You’ll know what to do’. On the floor he finds a pile of sand - and in the sand is Mr Darrow’s latest creation - a tiny boy, no bigger than a raisin, Luke, Prince of the Blues. And behind the tiny boy - millions of others - a thriving, bustling, sprawling civilisation!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are our ears supposed to be a weird shape? Why do we sneeze? What is the point in having skin?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The human body is one of the most complicated things in the Universe. Join Professor Astro Cat and the whole gang as they journey through all the wondrous parts of the human body, with the help of writer Dominic Walliman himself! From head to toe and everywhere in-between, there’s nothing left out of this fascinating human body odyssey!”</p>

<p>We love this beautifully produced series that looks at science topics in brilliant detail.</p>

<p>The incredible true story of Belka and Strelka who, unlike their predecessor, poor Laika, survived their space flight to become celebrities on their return.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In 1960, two stray dogs were plucked from the streets of Moscow to be the guinea pigs of manned space flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Selected from a number of potential canine cosmonauts, Belka and Strelka are put through their paces on the ground, as they practice rocket simulations and wearing spacesuits, before being launched into outer space as the first ever living creatures to successfully orbit the Earth. Miraculously, the dogs survive the mission and upon their return embark on a tour of the USSR, clad in their carefully tailored jumpsuits - one red, one green - becoming international celebrities in the process.”</p>

<p>The new title from the award-winning creator of <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2191910"><cite>The Egg</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Employing the earth-tone coloring and delicate illustrations that have made her an enormously popular children’s author, Teckentrup turns her gaze to the endlessly fascinating feather. What are they made of? Why do birds have so many of them? How do they help birds fly? And what other purpose do they serve?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Have you ever wondered how a dinosaur would measure up against the Great Pyramids of Giza, if a hummingbird could outfly a jet plane, or how many atoms could fit inside a grain of sand? These are just some of the questions explored in this book of comparisons.”</p>
