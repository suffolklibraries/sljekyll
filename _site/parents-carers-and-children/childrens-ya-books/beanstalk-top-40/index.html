<p>Children’s literacy charity Beanstalk have put together a list of the best books to motivate and inspire children to read. The Beanstalk Top 40 has been handpicked by children’s literacy experts.</p>

<p>Beanstalk’s Story Starters reading helpers go into schools and help children develop a love of books and reading. They are currently <a href="https://www.beanstalkcharity.org.uk/become-a-story-starter">recruiting for volunteers in Suffolk</a>. The books on this list will also be part of a starter pack for schools that sign up to the scheme.</p>

<p>Although the list is aimed at reluctant and struggling readers, these are books that all children can enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You might think a book with no pictures seems boring and serious. Except, here’s how books work. Everything written on the page has to be said by the person reading it aloud. Even if the words say ‘blork’ or ‘bluurf’. Even if the words are a preposterous song about eating ants for breakfast, or just a list of astonishingly goofy sounds like ‘blaggity blaggity’ and ‘glibbity globbity’.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pete the badger likes everything to be neat and tidy at all times, but what starts as the collecting of one fallen leaf escalates quickly and ends with the complete destruction of the forest! Will Pete realise the error of his ways and set things right?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lottie-potter-wants-an-otter-by-jeanne-willis--leonie-lord"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1923827"><cite>Lottie Potter Wants an Otter</cite>, by Jeanne Willis &amp; Leonie Lord</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Little Brother wants to join in the fun with his sibling, but Big Brother won’t let him play.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Fetch me a Snappenpoop!’ says Big Brother. But everybody knows there’s no such thing as a Snappenpoop - or is there?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="daves-cave-by-frann-preston-gannon"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1950624"><cite>Dave’s Cave</cite>, by Frann Preston-Gannon</a></h2>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But it turns out that good caves are hard to find. They’re either too small, or too big, or too full of bats, until he finds one that looks much more promising. Outside has the perfect space for a fire and the grass is greener than any he’s ever seen. But why does it look so familiar?”</p>
</blockquote>

The fox can’t believe his luck so he asks the goose to go for a stroll. The goose, with her angelic face, cannot refuse. Suddenly, a little chick pops up warning the protagonist: ‘That is NOT a good idea!’ All too late! This fox is on a roll and next, he invites the goose back to his house tucked away in the deep, dark woods, and … the goose says YES!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Vivian French explores some of the fibs we tell children and children tell us about reading and books in a fun picture book.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From excuses like ‘I haven’t got time to read’ to misconceptions about those who struggle with reading, the book turns negatives on their head and celebrates the right we all have to access story, and the wonders of the printed page.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Archie is an accident waiting to happen. He can’t help it. In just one week at school, he is accused of murder, gets trapped in the staff cloakroom without any clothes, and somehow manages to turn himself into a dog. Not to mention the poisonous spider and the Health and Safety Inspector who gets a toilet stuck on his head!”</p>
