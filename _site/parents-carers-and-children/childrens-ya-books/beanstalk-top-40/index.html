<p>Children’s literacy charity Beanstalk have put together a list of the best books to motivate and inspire children to read. The Beanstalk Top 40 has been handpicked by children’s literacy experts.</p>

<p>Beanstalk’s Story Starters reading helpers go into schools and help children develop a love of books and reading. They are currently <a href="https://www.beanstalkcharity.org.uk/become-a-story-starter">recruiting for volunteers in Suffolk</a>. The books on this list will also be part of a starter pack for schools that sign up to the scheme.</p>

<p>Although the list is aimed at reluctant and struggling readers, these are books that all children can enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You might think a book with no pictures seems boring and serious. Except, here’s how books work. Everything written on the page has to be said by the person reading it aloud. Even if the words say ‘blork’ or ‘bluurf’. Even if the words are a preposterous song about eating ants for breakfast, or just a list of astonishingly goofy sounds like ‘blaggity blaggity’ and ‘glibbity globbity’.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Little Brother wants to join in the fun with his sibling, but Big Brother won’t let him play.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Fetch me a Snappenpoop!’ says Big Brother. But everybody knows there’s no such thing as a Snappenpoop - or is there?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="daves-cave-by-frann-preston-gannon"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1950624"><cite>Dave’s Cave</cite>, by Frann Preston-Gannon</a></h2>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But it turns out that good caves are hard to find. They’re either too small, or too big, or too full of bats, until he finds one that looks much more promising. Outside has the perfect space for a fire and the grass is greener than any he’s ever seen. But why does it look so familiar?”</p>
</blockquote>

The fox can’t believe his luck so he asks the goose to go for a stroll. The goose, with her angelic face, cannot refuse. Suddenly, a little chick pops up warning the protagonist: ‘That is NOT a good idea!’ All too late! This fox is on a roll and next, he invites the goose back to his house tucked away in the deep, dark woods, and … the goose says YES!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Archie is an accident waiting to happen. He can’t help it. In just one week at school, he is accused of murder, gets trapped in the staff cloakroom without any clothes, and somehow manages to turn himself into a dog. Not to mention the poisonous spider and the Health and Safety Inspector who gets a toilet stuck on his head!”</p>

  <p>“When Lucy hears noises from behind the wall she tries to warn her parents that there are wolves banging about. But her parents don’t listen. When the wolves finally take over the house and Lucy and her family are evicted to live in the garden. her parents realise perhaps they should have listened.</p>

  <p>“But Lucy is no shrinking violet and pretty soon she has the wolves out and the family back in the house. So what was that noise Lucy heard coming from behind the wall?”</p>
