<blockquote>
  <p>“When a group of explorers stumble upon a girl living in the forest, they bring her to their concrete apartment block. But our little girl was raised by animals, taught to talk by birds, to eat by bears, to play by foxes. Her captors are in for quite the surprise. They’ll soon learn you cannot tame something so happily wild!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exciting illustrations and a strong message about nature and what it is to be free-spirited, by Hawaiian artist Hughes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The late, great Babette Cole created her irreverent and fiercely independent hero back in 1986.

<blockquote>
  <p>“While on an expedition to illustrate the magical creatures of the mountains around her home, Hilda spots a mountain troll. As the blue-haired explorer sits and sketches, she slowly starts to nod off. By the time she wakes up, the troll has totally disappeared and, even worse, Hilda is lost in a snowstorm. On her way home, Hilda befriends a lonely wooden man, and narrowly avoids getting squashed by a lost giant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hilda is ‘an adventurous young girl who lives in an idyllic mountainous wilderness with her mother and deerfox companion, Twig’.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Garth Nix is on hilarious form as he spins his very own fairy tale, featuring Princess Anya, who, with her loyal dog, must embark on a terribly important (capital Q) Quest to acquire the ingredients for a reversal lip balm, the vital item needed to change a frog back to a prince - oh, and save her kingdom from her villainous step(step)father.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Featuring an almost all-female cast of princesses, wizards, warriors, robbers and transfigured animals, this is a funny and a great adventure.</p>

<p>In the first book in this outstanding series:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Lyra’s friend Roger disappears, she and her daemon, Pantalaimon, determine to find him. The ensuing quest leads them into the bleak splendour of the North, where armoured bears rule the ice and witch-queens fly through the frozen skies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s also an excellent <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2010930">audiobook version</a>.</p>

<h3 id="three-cheers-for-women-by-marcia-williams"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2267485"><cite>Three Cheers for Women!</cite>, by Marcia Williams</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Campaigning through wars and facism, demanding their vote via protests, rallies and even imprisonment, global women’s suffrage took more than a century to achieve and is still ongoing today. Tracing its history from New Zealand at the end of the 19th century, follow this empowering movement as it spread from Oceania to Europe and the Americas, then Africa and Asia up to the present day.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were good at math - really good. They participated in some of NASA’s greatest successes, like providing the calculations for America’s first journeys into space. And they did so during a time when being black and a woman limited what they could do. But they worked hard. They persisted. And they used their genius minds to change the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this picture book edition, we explore the story of four female African American mathematicians at NASA and how they overcame gender and racial barriers to succeed in a highly challenging STEM-based career.”</p>

She’s a girl who loves cricket, gossips with her best friends, and, on the day of the shooting, nearly overslept and missed an exam. A girl who saw women suddenly banned from public, schools blown up, the Taliban seize control, and her homeland descend into a state of fear and repression.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is the story of her life and her passionate belief in every child’s right to education, her determination to make that a reality throughout the world and her hope to inspire others.”</p>
