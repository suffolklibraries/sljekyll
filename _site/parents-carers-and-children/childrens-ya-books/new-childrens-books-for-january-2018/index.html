  <p>“Campaigning through wars and facism, demanding their vote via protests, rallies and even imprisonment, global women’s suffrage took more than a century to achieve and is still ongoing today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tracing its history from New Zealand at the end of the 19th century, follow this empowering movement as it spread from Oceania to Europe and the Americas, then Africa and Asia up to the present day.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were good at maths - really good. They participated in some of NASA’s greatest successes, like providing the calculations for America’s first journeys into space. And they did so during a time when being black and a woman limited what they could do. But they worked hard. They persisted. And they used their genius minds to change the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this picture book edition, we explore the story of four female African American mathematicians at NASA and how they overcame gender and racial barriers to succeed in a highly challenging STEM-based career.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Women in Sport</cite> celebrates the success of the tough, bold and fearless women who paved the way for today’s athletes. The sportswomen featured include well-known figures like tennis player Serena Williams and broadcaster Clare Balding, as well as lesser-known pioneers like Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim the English Channel, and Keiko Fukuda, the highest-ranked female judoka in history.”</p>
