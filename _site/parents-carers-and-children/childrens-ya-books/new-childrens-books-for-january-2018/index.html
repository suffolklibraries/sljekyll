<blockquote>
  <p>“Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were good at maths - really good. They participated in some of NASA’s greatest successes, like providing the calculations for America’s first journeys into space. And they did so during a time when being black and a woman limited what they could do. But they worked hard. They persisted. And they used their genius minds to change the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this picture book edition, we explore the story of four female African American mathematicians at NASA and how they overcame gender and racial barriers to succeed in a highly challenging STEM-based career.”</p>
