He’s big and sunburned, and he doesn’t seem to be as engaged as he once was. It’s easier to play outside in the wreckage of the bombings than to stay at home with a dad she doesn’t know anymore. But when Ruby hurts her knee in the ruins, there’s only one person who can rescue her and make her feel all right.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Kay and her little sister, Eloise, never imagined that their standard icy Christmas Eve in Cambridge would be the start of a twelve-night odyssey. Kay’s father is working late - as usual. Fed up, her mother bundles her daughters into the car and drives to her husband’s Cambridge college to collect him herself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when they arrive, the staff claim that nobody by his name has ever worked there. Kay is puzzled by her mother’s reaction - silent tears, not anger and confusion. And what is even more puzzling is the card on her pillow when they return home: Will O. de Wisp, Gent. F.H.S.P. and Phillip R.T. Gibbet, Gent. F.H.S.P. K.Bith. REMOVALS. That night, Kay is woken by voices at her window: the voices of Will and Phillip, the Removers. But they are not human. And Kay shouldn’t be able to see them. Except she can!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publisher Puffin describes this as the kind of book that “every editor dreams of discovering; the kind that gives you goosebumps from the off because the writing, characters and setting are all so vivid.”</p>

<p>In the fourth book in this comical series about a family of hyenas living in suburbia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Teddington’s wildest family have decided to stay at home and keep their heads down - it isn’t always easy hiding tails and fur under clothes, and it’s important not to raise suspicion amongst their human neighbours. But trouble soon comes skulking when a very sly fox starts making a big nuisance of himself. It’s up to the Bolds to try and stop him - but the solution has them foxed!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-fox-girl-and-the-white-gazelle-by-victoria-williamson"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2352820"><cite>The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle</cite>, by Victoria Williamson</a></h3>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Under the grey Glasgow skies, 12-year-old refugee Reema is struggling to find her place in a new country, with a new language and without her brother. But she isn’t the only one feeling lost. Her Glaswegian neighbour Caylin is lonely and lashing out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When they discover an injured fox and her cubs hiding on their estate, the girls form a wary friendship. And they are more alike than they could have imagined: they both love to run. As Reema and Caylin learn to believe again, in themselves and in others, they find friendship, freedom and the discovery that home isn’t a place, it’s the people you love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ghost-boys-by-jewell-parker-rhodes"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2352808"><cite>Ghost Boys</cite>, by Jewell Parker Rhodes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Twelve-year-old Jerome doesn’t get into trouble. He goes to school. He does his homework. He takes care of his little sister. Then Jerome is shot by a police officer who mistakes his toy gun for a real threat. As a ghost, watching his family trying to cope with his death, Jerome begins to notice other ghost boys. Each boy has a story and they all have something in common. Bit by bit, Jerome begins to understand what really happened - not just to him, but to all of the ghost boys.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Boys need to know that prince charmings and brave hunters are not the only role-models. In fact, a whole lot of them out there don’t identify with the idea of being a strong, independent, competitive saviour who never cries. As a boy, there is an assumption that you will conform to this stereotypical idea of masculinity, but what if you’re the introvert kind, what if you prefer to pick up a book rather than a sword, what if you’re very sensitive, what if you like the idea of wearing a dress?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Animals of all shapes and sizes make epic journeys across our planet, through harsh weather and avoiding hungry predators, in their efforts to survive. Picture the migrations of: The emperor penguin, through snow, ice and bitter temperatures. A great white shark, swimming 10,000 km in search of seals. Huge herds of elephants, on their yearly hunt for water. Millions of red crabs, in a migration across Christmas Island that can last for 18 days. With colour illustrations, read and visualise the astonishing migrations of 20 creatures, in this truly inspiring narrative.”</p>
