<blockquote>
  <p>“From huskies, born to run, to those big bad bruisers, the security dogs. Meet Bruno, the smallest dog on the farm, and Charlie, the dancing chihuahua. Find rescue dogs, helping dogs, yappy dogs, happy dogs - and the dog with the waggiest tail!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This collection of poems is written from the perspective of the dogs themselves and is likely to be as much of a hit with dog-loving adults as children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Covering everything from Pangea to the world’s weirdest natural wonders, this is Earth in all its strange glory. ‘<cite>What’s Weird on Earth</cite> is an entirely new atlas adventure, with maps of UFO sightings, popular foods, every country resized according to population density, and their popularity as holiday destinations. Kids can spot the strangest features on every corner of Earth; from ancient patterns carved in the desert sand to the 29,000 bath toys that sailed the world’s ocean currents after a shipwreck.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Travel back in time to discover maps from previous centuries or turn the globe upside down - literally.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What is an election? Who gets to be Prime Minister or President? What does immigration mean? This essential introduction to politics for children answers all these questions and many more. Topics debated include capitalism, socialism, nationalism, terrorism, voting systems, free speech and human rights.”</p>
