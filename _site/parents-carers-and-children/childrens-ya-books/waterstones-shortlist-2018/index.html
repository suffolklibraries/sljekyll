<blockquote>
  <p>“When a polar bear arrives unexpectedly in the woods, the animals fear and avoid him, suspecting him to be dangerous - and his habit of collecting leaves only adds to their distrust. Then one day, they watch as he attempts to fly over the water with wings made of colourful leaves, just trying to go home. Maybe he needs some help?”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When a travelling bard arrives at Thornwood Warren on Midwinter night, he is warmly welcomed.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Morrigan Crow is cursed. Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she’s blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks - and, worst of all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh birthday.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But as Morrigan awaits her fate, a strange and remarkable man named Jupiter North appears. Chased by black-smoke hounds and shadowy hunters on horseback, he whisks her away into the safety of a secret, magical city called Nevermoor. It’s then that Morrigan discovers Jupiter has chosen her to contend for a place in the city’s most prestigious organisation: the Wundrous Society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In order to join, she must compete in four difficult and dangerous trials against hundreds of other children, each boasting an extraordinary talent that sets them apart - an extraordinary talent that Morrigan insists she does not have.”</p>

Then Dad disappears and Violet is determined to uncover the truth with the help of the mysterious Boy. But returning normality to Perfect is a battle they never imagined.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A shooting star crashes to Earth and changes Elliot’s life forever. The star is Virgo - a young Zodiac goddess on a mission.
