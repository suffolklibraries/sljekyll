</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With a visa, Alpha’s journey would take a matter of hours; without one he is adrift for 18 months. Along the way he meets an unforgettable cast of characters, each one giving another human face to the crisis.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Perfect</cite> tells the story of a young boy who learns to accept that his baby sister has a disability but that she is still perfect in every way.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The illustrated story begins in 1766 with Billy Marvel, the lone survivor of a shipwreck, and charts the adventures of his family of actors over five generations.
