With beautifully lyrical language, Smriti Prasadam-Halls explores the lightning speed, echoing howl and family life of these mysterious animals, revealing astonishing facts and overturning misconceptions as she does so.”</p>

<h3 id="the-guggenheim-mystery-by-robin-stevens"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2183886"><cite>The Guggenheim Mystery</cite>, by Robin Stevens</a></h3>

<p>The great Siobhan Dowd created Ted Sparks, a boy with an unusual way of looking at the world, for the excellent <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2031055"><cite>The London Eye Mystery</cite></a> almost a decade. Sadly, she died before she could write the planned sequel but this year, mystery writer and author of the Murder Most Unladylike series Robin Stevens took up the challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is the story of my second mystery. This summer, I went on holiday to New York, to visit Aunt Gloria and Salim. While I was there, a painting was stolen from the Guggenheim Museum, where Aunt Gloria works. Everyone was very worried and upset. I did not see what the problem was. I do not see the point of paintings, even if they are worth £9.8 million. Perhaps that’s because of my very unusual brain, which works on a different operating system to everyone else’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But then Aunt Gloria was blamed for the theft - and Aunt Gloria is family.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Xar is a Wizard boy who has no Magic, and will do anything to get it. Wish is a Warrior girl, but she owns a banned Magical Object, and she will do anything to conceal it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this whirlwind adventure, Xar and Wish must forget their differences if they’re going to make it to the dungeons at Warrior Fort.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Where something that has been sleeping for hundreds of years is stirring…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latest book from the creator of How to Train your Dragon has become a bestseller, and with good reason. It’s an enchanting tale, funny and heartfelt and full of endearing characters, all subject to Cowell’s hilarious and in inventive spin. The amazing illustrations really bring this book to life as they wind and flow over the pages - sometimes dark and creepy, never boring.</p>
