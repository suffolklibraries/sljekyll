<p>Fans of Alison Jay’s slightly surreal illustrations will be pleased to see her publish a set of early learning board books this month. Other titles are <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185369">Alison Jay’s ABC</a>, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185370">Alison Jay’s Colours</a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185368">Alison Jay’s First Words</a>.</p>

<p>The perennial favourite <cite>Little Princess</cite> story is being republished with the addition of a sound button. We have ordered loads of copies because we can never have too many Tony Ross books in stock to satisfy our most demanding customers.</p>

<p>This is the 50th title in the famous tactile series from Usborne, so we felt it should be on our list for the month even though the object of this one is too fanciful for words!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bobo the chimp is back in this perfect picture book for every little monkey that doesn’t want to go to bed yet! The sun is still up and this little chimp wants to play with his jungle friends, but then the sun goes down and he’s all alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="baby-goes-to-market-by-atinuke--angela-brooksbank"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2168676"><cite>Baby Goes to Market</cite>, by Atinuke &amp; Angela Brooksbank</a></h3>

<p>Baby bounces along on his mother’s back in this gorgeous rhyming picture book, enjoying secret snacks along the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Poor old dragon. Nobody wants him in their story. Not Goldilocks, not Hansel and Gretel - no one. But Dragon will not give up! He shall continue on his course of finding someone who wants him in their story. ANYONE. His boundless enthusiasm surely won’t get him into any trouble. Surely.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dragon can’t get into any of the traditional fairy tales, so he decides to write his own. It’s very funny, and young children should enjoy spotting familiar characters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sophie doesn’t want a fairy tale about drippy princesses and pompous princes, she wants the princess to do the rescuing, with a ferocious, fighting transformer!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a hilarious, subversive sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1928811"><cite>This is not a Bedtime Story</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is the hat that Zack loves. This is the dog that races past and snatches the hat that Zack loves!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This variant on <cite>The House that Jack Built</cite> is funny, has lots of repetition and would be perfect to read aloud.</p>

</blockquote>

She doesn’t like her enclosure - or her burrow - or even her food. Can Zoe and Meep work out what is making Poppy the puffin so picky, and come up with a plan to make the little puffin feel happy in her new home?”</p>

  <p>“But with the house being used to accommodate GIs and an entire class of evacuated schoolgirls, there’s no time to think about her old life. Soon there are horses living indoors, the girls have taken over the house, and Lyla finds out that friends come in all shapes and sizes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fenn Halflin is on the run from the brutal Terra Firma. His survival depends on finding the last of the Resistance, said to be hiding in an ancient, flooded forest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Accompanied by his faithful mongoose, Tikki, Fenn must embark on a journey that will take him deep into the treacherous marsh and closer to the secrets of his past. But as the water levels continue to rise, his mission to unite the Seaborn people has never been more desperate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Written by Suffolk Libraries’ very own author, Francesca, it isn’t only the people of Halesworth who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of this sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1977471"><cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Desperate to be helpful, Olive becomes his post-girl, carrying secret messages (as she likes to think of the letters) to the villagers. But Olive has a secret of her own. Her older sister Sukie went missing in an air raid, and she’s desperate to discover what happened to her. And then she finds a strange coded note which seems to link Sukie to Devon, and to something dark and impossibly dangerous.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-griffins-feather-by-cornelia-funke"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2173693"><cite>The Griffin’s Feather</cite>, by Cornelia Funke</a></h3>

His silver dragon, Firedrake, agrees to help. But Griffins are a dragon’s fiercest enemy, and live far away in the sweltering jungle. A dangerous and exciting adventure begins.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2171907"><cite>Dragon Rider</cite></a>.</p>

<h3 id="kid-normal-by-greg-james--chris-smith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2173648"><cite>Kid Normal</cite>, by Greg James &amp; Chris Smith</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Murph Cooper rocks up to his new school several weeks into the beginning of term, he can’t help but feel a bit out of his depth. And it’s not because he’s worried about where to sit, and making friends, and fitting in, or not knowing where the loos are. It’s because his mum has enrolled him at a school for superheroes by mistake. And unlike his fellow students, who can all control the weather or fly or conjure tiny horses from thin air, Murph has no special abilities whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But just because you don’t have superpowers, it doesn’t mean you can’t save the day. Let’s hope Murph realises that, and quick - because not far away is a great big bad guy who is half man and half wasp, and his mind is abuzz with evil plans.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the debut novel of two Radio 1 presenters, and it looks hilarious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jasper Spam is mad about science - the problem is that all of his experiments tend to end in a BANG! However, one day - and quite by accident - Jasper manages to invent something that will change the world forever!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1759665"><cite>The Accidental Prime Minister</cite></a> was a triumph, so this could be very funny and packed with adventure (and misadventures!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Another wonderfully entertaining foray into the woods where Bunny and his friends are battling Monkey in increasingly crazy and hilarious ways.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all started long ago in <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1592973">book 1</a> when The British Space Agency sent a monkey into space. The story gathered pace in books <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1807267"><cite>2</cite></a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1993911"><cite>3</cite></a>, but you don’t have to read them in sequence; just start at book 4 and enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cars do so much more than get us from A to B: they are vehicles of beauty that allow drivers to determine their own destination. Trace their extraordinary history in this gorgeously illustrated guide, from Benz’s first motor wagon to the jet-propelled ThrustSSC.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This illustrated social history of the car is filled with swish looking photographs of iconic motors – so it’s perfect for petrolheads too.</p>
