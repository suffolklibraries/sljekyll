<p>This is the 50th title in the famous tactile series from Usborne, so we felt it should be on our list for the month even though the object of this one is too fanciful for words!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bobo the chimp is back in this perfect picture book for every little monkey that doesn’t want to go to bed yet! The sun is still up and this little chimp wants to play with his jungle friends, but then the sun goes down and he’s all alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Join Baby and his mama at the bustling marketplace for a bright, bouncy read-aloud offering a gentle introduction to numbers. Rhythmic language, visual humour and a bounty of delectable food make this a tale that is sure to whet little appetites for story time.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Poor old dragon. Nobody wants him in their story. Not Goldilocks, not Hansel and Gretel - no one. But Dragon will not give up! He shall continue on his course of finding someone who wants him in their story. ANYONE. His boundless enthusiasm surely won’t get him into any trouble. Surely.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dragon can’t get into any of the traditional fairy tales, so he decides to write his own. It’s very funny, and young children should enjoy spotting familiar characters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sophie doesn’t want a fairy tale about drippy princesses and pompous princes, she wants the princess to do the rescuing, with a ferocious, fighting transformer!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a hilarious, subversive sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1928811"><cite>This is not a Bedtime Story</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is the hat that Zack loves. This is the dog that races past and snatches the hat that Zack loves!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This variant on <cite>The House that Jack Built</cite> is funny, has lots of repetition and would be perfect to read aloud.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>“Puffins are Zoe’s favourite ever animal, so when Poppy arrives at the Rescue Zoo, Zoe is very happy to help her settle in. But Poppy is very picky!

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But with the house being used to accommodate GIs and an entire class of evacuated schoolgirls, there’s no time to think about her old life. Soon there are horses living indoors, the girls have taken over the house, and Lyla finds out that friends come in all shapes and sizes.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Written by Suffolk Libraries’ very own author, Francesca, it isn’t only the people of Halesworth who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of this sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1977471"><cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“February, 1941. After months of bombing raids in London, 12 year old Olive Bradshaw and her little brother Cliff are evacuated to the Devon coast. The only person with two spare beds is Mr Ephraim, the local lighthouse keeper. But he’s not used to company and he certainly doesn’t want any evacuees.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Desperate to be helpful, Olive becomes his post-girl, carrying secret messages (as she likes to think of the letters) to the villagers. But Olive has a secret of her own. Her older sister Sukie went missing in an air raid, and she’s desperate to discover what happened to her. And then she finds a strange coded note which seems to link Sukie to Devon, and to something dark and impossibly dangerous.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2171907"><cite>Dragon Rider</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Murph Cooper rocks up to his new school several weeks into the beginning of term, he can’t help but feel a bit out of his depth. And it’s not because he’s worried about where to sit, and making friends, and fitting in, or not knowing where the loos are. It’s because his mum has enrolled him at a school for superheroes by mistake. And unlike his fellow students, who can all control the weather or fly or conjure tiny horses from thin air, Murph has no special abilities whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But just because you don’t have superpowers, it doesn’t mean you can’t save the day. Let’s hope Murph realises that, and quick - because not far away is a great big bad guy who is half man and half wasp, and his mind is abuzz with evil plans.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the debut novel of two Radio 1 presenters, and it looks hilarious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jasper Spam is mad about science - the problem is that all of his experiments tend to end in a BANG! However, one day - and quite by accident - Jasper manages to invent something that will change the world forever!”</p>

<p><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1759665"><cite>The Accidental Prime Minister</cite></a> was a triumph, so this could be very funny and packed with adventure (and misadventures!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Another wonderfully entertaining foray into the woods where Bunny and his friends are battling Monkey in increasingly crazy and hilarious ways.”</p>

<p>It all started long ago in <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1592973">book 1</a> when The British Space Agency sent a monkey into space.

<p>This illustrated social history of the car is filled with swish looking photographs of iconic motors – so it’s perfect for petrolheads too.</p>
