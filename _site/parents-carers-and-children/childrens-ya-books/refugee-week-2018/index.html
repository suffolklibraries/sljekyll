Happy for the first time since leaving her war-torn home, she is devastated when her foster mother announces that a new family has been found for her and she will be moving on. Feeling rejected and abandoned, Aisha packs her bags and runs away, seeking shelter in the nearby woods.</p>

  <p>“Meanwhile, a few doors down, twelve-year-old Zak is trying to cope with his parents’ divorce. Living in a near-building site while the new house is being refurbished, he feels unsettled and alone.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Two refugee brothers from Mongolia are determined to fit in with their Liverpool schoolmates, but bring so much of Mongolia to Bootle that their new friend &amp; guide, Julie, is hard-pressed to know truth from fantasy as she recollects a friendship that was abruptly ended when Chingis &amp; his family were forced to return to Mongolia.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In 1940 as war rages across Europe, ten-year-old Lindy waves goodbye to England and makes the long journey to Saskatoon, Canada, along with her mother and her cousin Cameron. They may be far from the war but they are also far from home and everyone they know and love. Life in Canada is very different but it is also full of exciting new adventures.”</p>

What Makes People Leave their Homes? And other big questions</cite>, by Michael Rosen &amp; Annemarie Young</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What does it mean for people to have to leave their homes, and what happens when they seek entry to another country? This book explores the history of refugees and migration around the world and the effects on people of never-ending war and conflict. It compares the effects on society of diversity and interculturalism with historical attempts to create a racially ‘pure’ culture.”</p>
