<blockquote>
  <p>“You are about to read the true story of Father Christmas. It is a story that proves that nothing is impossible. If you are one of those people who believe that some things are impossible, you should put this book down right away. It is most certainly not for you. Because this book is full of impossible things. Are you still reading? Good. Then let us begin. A tale of adventure, snow, kidnapping, elves, more snow, and an 11-year-old boy called Nikolas, who isn’t afraid to believe in magic…”</p>

Then disaster - the ball of secrets disappears! Soon everyone’s deepest secrets are being revealed to the whole school.”</p>

Later, in an effort to impress a neighbor she bakes a cake, but with liniment instead of vanilla.”</p>
