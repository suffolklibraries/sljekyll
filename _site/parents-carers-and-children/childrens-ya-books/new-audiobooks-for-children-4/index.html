<blockquote>
  <p>“Stick Dog and his furry friends, Mutt, Stripes, Karen and Poo-Poo are back in another adventure! Everyone’s favourite cartoon canines are hungry again - and this time it’s pizza that has their mouths watering. But when it’s pizza on the go - can they chase it down?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-bolds-to-the-rescue-written--read-by-julian-clary"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2026693"><cite>The Bolds to the Rescue</cite>, written &amp; read by Julian Clary</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Bolds are a family of hyenas living as humans in a suburban house. But now their kindness to animal waifs and strays has become legendary, and more and more animals keep turning up to stay! Roger the sheep flocks to their house, and Fifi the poodle turns up to learn some new tricks, whilst Sheila the crocodile decides to stay for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when the Bolds take in a couple of race horses who are on the run, they worry their animal magnetism is getting to be too much. Have these hyenas bitten off more than they can chew?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="dragons-green-by-scarlett-thomas-read-by-roger-allam"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392031"><cite>Dragon’s Green</cite>, by Scarlett Thomas, read by Roger Allam</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Effie Truelove has made a promise to keep her grandfather’s magical books safe from danger. Whatever it takes. But it’s not always easy when you’re a pupil at the Tusitala School for the Gifted, Troubled and Strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Together with her new schoolfriends, Maximilian, Wolf, Lexy, and Raven, Effie must travel to the mysterious Otherworld and brave the terrifying Diberi, a secret organisation with plans that could destroy the entire universe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="beaky-malone-worst-ever-school-trip-by-barry-hutchison-read-by-joe-coen"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2387795"><cite>Beaky Malone: Worst Ever School Trip</cite>, by Barry Hutchison, read by Joe Coen</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s been 92 hours since Beaky last told a lie. So far he’s survived two full days of school with only three light beatings, two telling-offs and one wedgie - but the annual school trip is going to take Beaky’s survival skills to a whole other level - especially as a mix up in the school office means that Beaky and his class are on a trip to Learning Land, a rubbish theme park aimed at eight-year-olds. And home to cheery-but-creepy Clumso the Clued-up Clown whose job is to dish out fascinating facts to one and all.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But there is worse to come when Beaky’s partnered with Wayne, the school bully, who has a morbid fear of clowns. With Beaky unable to tell a lie and Wayne intent on beating him up, things aren’t looking good. And that’s before they find themselves on the run from a manic clown who’ll seemingly stop at nothing to track them down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jemima and Jake’s new babysitter doesn’t look too promising. In fact she looks very sensible, very old and very small (she only comes up to daddy’s armpit!) But the moment her parents leave the house, Marge gives a mischievous wink, takes off her hat and reveals a marvellous mane of rainbow-coloured hair!”</p>

<h3 id="the-wild-robot-by-peter-brown-read-by-kate-atwater"><a href="https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2639934"><cite>The Wild Robot</cite>, by Peter Brown, read by Kate Atwater</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When robot Roz opens her eyes for the first time, she discovers that she is alone on a remote, wild island. Why is she there? Where did she come from? And, most important, how will she survive in her harsh surroundings?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Roz’s only hope is to learn from the island’s hostile animal inhabitants. When she tries to care for an orphaned gosling, the other animals finally decide to help, and the island starts to feel like home. Until one day, the robot’s mysterious past comes back to haunt her.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-terrible-two-by-mac-barnett--jory-john-read-by-adam-verner"><a href="https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2061218"><cite>The Terrible Two</cite>, by Mac Barnett &amp; Jory John, read by Adam Verner</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Miles Murphy had it made. He lived in a great town near the ocean, he had two best friends, and most importantly, he had a reputation for being his town’s best prankster. All of which explains why he’s not happy to be moving to Yawnee Valley, a sleepy town that’s famous for one thing and one thing only: cows. Worse than that, Miles quickly discovers that Yawnee Valley already has a prankster — and a great one. If Miles is going to take the title from this mystery kid, he’ll have to raise his game.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s prankster against prankster in an epic war of trickery, until the two finally decide to join forces to pull off the biggest prank ever seen, a prank so huge it would make the members of the International Order of Disorder (a loose confederacy of pranksters that flourished a couple of centuries ago) proud.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="black-beauty-by-anna-sewell-read-by-ralph-cosham"><a href="https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/666140"><cite>Black Beauty</cite>, by Anna Sewell, read by Ralph Cosham</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From its first publication in 1877, <cite>Black Beauty</cite> has been one of the best-loved animal stories ever written. The dramatic and heartwarming tale is told by the magnificent black horse himself, from his idyllic days on a country squire’s estate to his harsh fate as a London cab horse and his merciful rescue by two kindly old ladies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Filled with vivid anecdotes about animal intelligence, the novel derives a special magic from the love of all creatures, great and small, apparent on every page. But the book’s lasting impact comes from its descriptions of a human society struggling to find the goodness within itself and its plea for kindness to all creatures—a message so powerful that this favourite classic began a crusade for animal welfare that continues to this day.”</p>

He’s been accepted to art school in the big city and imagines a math-and-history-free fun zone. Wrong! It’s more competitive than Rafe ever expected, and to score big in class, he needs to find a way to turn his boring life into the inspiration for a work of art. His method? Operation: Get a Life!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Anything he’s never done before, he’s going to do it, from learning to play poker to going to a modern art museum. But when his newest mission uncovers secrets about the family Rafe’s never known, he has to decide if he’s ready to have his world turned upside down.”</p>
