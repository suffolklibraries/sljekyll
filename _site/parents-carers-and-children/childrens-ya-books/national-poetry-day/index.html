<p>This year’s children’s poetry books include new editions of old favourites, wonderfully illustrated collections, and exciting debuts.</p>

<h2 id="the-lost-words-a-spell-book-by-robert-macfarlane--jackie-morris"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2257444"><cite>The Lost Words: a spell book</cite>, by Robert Macfarlane &amp; Jackie Morris</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hilda Offen’s new collection is a mixture of imaginative, thoughtful and funny poems. Meet the killer caterpillar on the prowl, the robber rabbit who is a criminal all-rounder, the reading dogs - and a troll who is not afraid to speak out about those Billy-Goats Gruff. There are poems about nature and the seasons and a look at our planet from the moon.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Wordery, this is ‘a mix of imaginative, thoughtful and funny poems with accessible and intriguing themes.’</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A dragon’s sneeze, a dinosaur, a wizard’s spell, a monster’s claw. All these things and many more - that’s what’s in a poem. An exciting collection of poems from talented young poet Joshua Seigal, perfect for introducing children to poetry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As a family of four spend a day exploring London, fun, child-friendly poems introduce readers to our wonderful capital city, and all its secrets. Well-known landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and the London Eye, plus inescapable features like rain and taking tea, all get Patty Toht’s witty treatment. Non-fiction facts provide more information about the subjects, while rising star Sam Usher brings them to life with his signature style and humour.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this celebration of our Earth, distinguished anthologist Wendy Cooling has chosen poems to make children look, think, and ask questions. Why are trees so important? How are motorways damaging our countryside? What can we do about rubbish? What can we do to protect our Earth for the future?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="my-mums-growing-down-by-laura-dockrill--david-tazzyman"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185136"><cite>My Mum’s Growing Down</cite>, by Laura Dockrill &amp; David Tazzyman</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mum is a gamer, a party animal and a free spirit making life hard work for her nine year old son. These poems are a glimpse into their parent child relationship; their antics and adventures. The poems are bold, brave, funny and sometimes very moving. This collection shows just how funny, rude and naughty mums can be!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Books For Keeps, ‘these poems celebrate the unconventional, they are full of warmth, humour and loving advice, ‘you get on with being you and I’ll get on with loving you.’’</p>

<h2 id="the-worlds-greatest-space-cadet-by-james-carter--ed-boxall"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2082936"><cite>The World’s Greatest Space Cadet</cite>, by James Carter &amp; Ed Boxall</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Join well loved poet James Carter on a journey through time and space: from Vikings to a marauding cat and from the edges of the universe to the world’s greatest space cadet.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Andrea Reece from LoveReading4Kids, ‘his poems will work their magic on all readers, and each one finds something new to say, ans the perfect way to say it. A treat from first page to last.’</p>

<h2 id="overheard-in-a-tower-block-by-joseph-coelho--kate-milner"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2168959"><cite>Overheard in a Tower Block</cite>, by Joseph Coelho &amp; Kate Milner</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Gazing at the stars from five storeys up, smelling the bins from five storeys below. Overheard arguments, overheard laughter. A disappearing father and a Mermaid-Queen mother; statues that sing for flesh and blood; bullies who kick you under the table; perfect red trainers - and the things that lurk in the library. Award-winning poet Joseph Coelho’s new collection is a powerful and moving poetic narrative about growing up in the city.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Booktrust, ‘many of these poems are sad or angry or bristle with an edginess that young teens may find refreshing when compared to other poetry aimed at them.’</p>
