<h3 id="ouch-i-need-a-plaster-by-nick-sharratt"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2101663"><cite>Ouch! I Need a Plaster!</cite>, by Nick Sharratt</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From furry ears to sticky paw prints, there are all sorts of textures for baby to explore in this safe, sturdy book that encourages early learning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consisting entirely of very cute puppy photos with tactile enhancements, this little board book should prove very popular with our youngest customers.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-a-friend-by-anne-booth--amy-proud"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2116431"><cite>I Want a Friend</cite>, by Anne Booth &amp; Amy Proud</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘I want a friend,’ said Arthur, ‘I want a friend right now. I want to make one RIGHT AWAY But I am not sure how’. Join Arthur at nursery school in his determined search for a friend - could he dig a hole to trap one, or catch one in a net?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This useful book is a sweet rhyming story about a little boy who wants to find someone to play with at nursery but isn’t sure how to go about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-pirates-of-scurvy-sands-by-jonny-duddle"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1998205"><cite>The Pirates of Scurvy Sands</cite>, by Jonny Duddle</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This summer, Matilda is going on holiday with her friends, the Jolley-Rogers. Their destination is the island of Scurvy Sands - a favourite holiday destination for pirates. When Matilda arrives, the swashbuckling residents are none-too impressed with her. She has clean teeth, tidy clothes and doesn’t smell like she’s been at sea for 6 months - they are certain she cannot be trusted. But when Matilda discovers the secret of the legendary treasure of Scurvy Sands, the pirates are very quick to change their minds.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new swashbuckling title from Jonny Duddle with awesome adventures and ingenious illustrations always comes high on our wish list, and this one looks as exciting as his previous books!</p>

<h3 id="there-was-an-old-dragon-who-swallowed-a-knight-by-penny-parker-klostermann--ben-mantle"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2072995"><cite>There Was an Old Dragon Who Swallowed a Knight</cite>, by Penny Parker Klostermann &amp; Ben Mantle</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This old dragon is very hungry! And he’s not going to stop until he’s gulped down almost the entire kingdom, knight’s armour and all. But is there any way of escape from a lazy dragon’s gut? Perhaps a good belch will help.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This re-take on the traditional rhyme is very funny, if a little difficult to get your tongue around in places. We think it will be very popular with playgroups.</p>

<h3 id="thank-goodness-for-bob-by-matthew-morgan--gabriel-alborozo"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078807"><cite>Thank Goodness for Bob</cite>, by Matthew Morgan &amp; Gabriel Alborozo</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Max is a child who worries. A lot. He worries about being bitten by spiders, abducted by aliens, or sometimes just that people don’t like him enough. Soon it feels like his worries might take over the world! Thank goodness for Bob the dog, who shows Max that the best way to deal with worries is to share them with a friend.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few books for young children deal with anxiety, but this picture book does so with ease. The sweet illustrations perfectly complement the gentle text. It’s bound to be popular, so we’ve bought lots of copies.</p>

<h3 id="the-naughty-naughty-baddies-by-mark-sperring--david-tazzyman"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2112557"><cite>The Naughty Naughty Baddies</cite>, by Mark Sperring &amp; David Tazzyman</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Once there were four Naughty, Naughty Baddies. And each one was as naughty as the next. They liked nothing more than being diabolically dreadful. But best of all, they loved creeping.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Four suggests a cunning plan to steal all the spots off the Queen’s Little Doggy Woof-Woof, they all grin fiendishly and chuckle evilly as they creep, creep, creep. What will the Queen do when she sees her spotless Little Doggy Woof-Woof? Where is the King sitting as they creep, creep past? (Clue: a throne of sorts.) Will the Naughty, Naughty Baddies get away with it?”</p>

<p>Rabbit and Bear are back in a second funny story, illustrated so expressively by Jim Field. In this book, poor old Rabbit can’t bear listening to Bear’s snores and is driven to distraction by the feverish drilling of a woodpecker.</p>

<h3 id="henry-pond-the-poet-by-dick-king-smith-and-victor-g-ambrus"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2110810"><cite>Henry Pond the Poet</cite>, by Dick King-Smith and Victor G. Ambrus</a></h3>

<p>New dyslexia-friendly edition of the late master storyteller’s froggy tale.</p>

<h3 id="a-race-for-toad-hall-by-tom-moorhouse--holly-swain"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2120282"><cite>A Race for Toad Hall</cite>, by Tom Moorhouse &amp; Holly Swain</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Teejay, Mo, and Ratty really shouldn’t be exploring the overgrown grounds of Toad Hall - but that’s never stopped them before. This time, though, they fall into a tunnel. Undaunted by tales that the Hall is haunted, they find something - someone - in the ice house. It’s none other than Mr Toad, and he’s been there for a hundred years.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>The Wind in the Willows</cite> reimagined for a new younger audience – how cool is that? As cool as an ice house perhaps? The second title in this new series is due in August.</p>

<h3 id="stop-the-monsters-by-helen-murray"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108913"><cite>Stop the Monsters</cite>, by Helen Murray</a></h3>

<h3 id="the-dragon-with-a-chocolate-heart-by-stephanie-burgis"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100232"><cite>The Dragon with a Chocolate Heart</cite>, by Stephanie Burgis</a></h3>

<p>A fierce dragon, Aventurine, is tricked into becoming a human in this fantasy aimed at the confident end of KS2. But then the chocolate drink was so tempting.</p>

<p>Holly Webb says it’s “funny, moving and deliciously full of chocolate!” Hilary McKay describes it as “a magical treat of dragons and heroines, with the best of all possible flavours.” And we say let’s curl up with it over a mug of cocoa.</p>

<h3 id="the-jamie-drake-equation-by-christopher-edge"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2105233"><cite>The Jamie Drake Equation</cite>, by Christopher Edge</a></h3>

<p>Jamie’s dad is an astronaut aboard the International Space Station. This is undoubtedly cool, but he misses him.</p>

<p>A family drama fused with a science thriller, this is another gripping story from Christopher Edge. In his previous novel, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1887960"><cite>The Many Worlds of Albie Bright</cite></a>, a teenage boy travels through multiple universes in the hope of finding his deceased mother alive.</p>

<h3 id="tally-and-squill-in-a-sticky-situation-by-abie-longstaff--james-brown"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1983725"><cite>Tally and Squill in a Sticky Situation</cite>, by Abie Longstaff &amp; James Brown</a></h3>

<p>Orphan Tally (real name Tallulah), a servant at Mollett Manor, uses her wits to solve a cunning burglary. The book was originally called <cite>The Secret Library</cite> and much of the action takes place around ancient tomes. It’s an exciting start to a new illustrated mystery series for 8-10 year-olds.</p>

<p>James Brown’s black and white drawings are a delight and add greatly to the sense of place. I just wish the typeface were a little bigger.</p>

<h3 id="the-moonlight-statue-by-holly-webb"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2094655"><cite>The Moonlight Statue</cite>, by Holly Webb</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As soon as she moves to Penhallow Place, Poppy can’t wait to unravel its mysteries. One night, she sleepwalks outside and wakes to find her hand on the stone statue of a dog. The dog introduces himself as Rex, an Irish Wolfhound, who lived at Penhallow many hundreds of years earlier. And he is not the only resident ghost.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>The Hounds of Penhallow Hall</cite> is a new mystery series from the ace storyteller Holly Webb. There’s more than a touch of <cite>Ghost</cite> about it too.</p>

<h3 id="the-mystery-of-the-painted-dragon-by-katherine-woodfine"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100203"><cite>The Mystery of the Painted Dragon</cite>, by Katherine Woodfine</a></h3>

<p>London in 1909 is the setting for this third book in the thrilling <cite>Sinclair’s Mysteries</cite>, period sleuthing adventures with exciting plots and feisty characters. My heart was in my mouth as I read the first chapter, from the moment the heroine realises she is being followed to her fall onto the rails of an underground station. Can’t wait to read more…</p>

<h3 id="nature-by-clare-beaton"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2141455"><cite>Nature</cite>, by Clare Beaton</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whether it’s wandering in woodlands or watching wildlife, being outdoors in nature is a favourite activity for children. Clare Beaton shares her passion for the world around us and suggests creative nature crafts for adults and children to enjoy together. This is the book that brings nature to your door!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nicely produced, achievable craft book for children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you’re walking along the city streets there’s always so much to see and hear. But do you ever stop and look down? Have you ever wondered what’s going on deep in the ground under your feet? What about in the countryside? What goes on underground there? Starting in the city, take a journey down though the layers of the Earth, all the way to the planet’s core and out the other side. There are so many amazing sights to see along the way!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be very careful if you borrow this title, because it has a concertina format, but it’s such a useful book, we couldn’t resist.</p>
