<h3 id="mummy-baby-by-beth-harwood--emma-dodd"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185051"><cite>Mummy, Baby</cite>, by Beth Harwood &amp; Emma Dodd</a></h3>

<p>From the Amazing Baby series is this simple board book for the very young.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The tabs slide to reveal a parent animal - cat, dog - on one side, with babies - kittens, puppies - on the other side.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="spot-goes-to-the-fire-station-by-eric-hill"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186704"><cite>Spot goes to the Fire Station</cite>, by Eric Hill</a></h3>

<p>With the double draw of Spot and a fire station, this new board book will prove very popular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Spot knows just what he wants to be when he grows up - a fireman, just like his grandpa. When he visits Grandpa at the fire station, cheeky Spot slides down the pole, climbs the ladder, soaks Grandpa with the hose and finally sounds the noisy siren. Spot thinks he’s a very good fireman, but perhaps Grandpa is not so sure!”</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see inside this latest exciting title in the Ten Little series, because if the cover is anything to go by, it will be hilarious. Brownlow’s rhyming texts simply roll his plots along with joyous humour ,and as for Simon Rickerty’s illustrations, they are endearing, charming, inclusive, appealing and we LOVE them!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-house-by-john-burningham"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2193713"><cite>Mouse House</cite>, by John Burningham</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the house there lives a family: a mum, a dad, a girl and a boy. But they are not alone; a secret mouse family is living there too, who only come out when everyone else is asleep. One day they are spotted and the mouse catcher is called. Will they escape in time?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many ways can a cat interact with a box? This cat will entrance young readers as it investigates every box it can - and makes a mouse friend along the way. With bright, bold illustrations from Edward Underwood, this is a striking and witty book for children and adults alike.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="school-for-little-monsters-by-michelle-robinson--sarah-horne"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186131"><cite>School for Little Monsters</cite>, by Michelle Robinson &amp; Sarah Horne</a></h3>

<p>This book, in the Usborne First Reading (Level 1) series, has been especially adapted from Kipling’s <cite>Just So Stories</cite>, for children who are beginning readers. It is a hardback, so it feels like a “proper” book. It’s packed full of illustrations to add interest and aid understanding.</p>

<h3 id="the-princess-and-the-pea-by-matthew-oldham--lorena-alvarez"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2185699"><cite>The Princess and the Pea</cite>, by Matthew Oldham &amp; Lorena Alvarez</a></h3>

<p>Another super little hardback retelling of a traditional tale that Usborne do so well. I love the cover illustration of all those mattresses – hope the prince has brought a ladder!</p>

<h3 id="grandads-medal-by-phil-earle--sarah-horne"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2170470"><cite>Grandad’s Medal</cite>, by Phil Earle &amp; Sarah Horne</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Marvin loves going on his adventures with his grandad - escaping from hairy yetis, taking daytrips to Mars and hunting ferocious tigers - all without leaving the house. Marvin thinks his grandad is the bravest person he’s ever met; he even has a medal from the war to prove it. And, more than anything else, Marvin wants to be brave too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when Grandad must go on his final adventure alone, Marvin finds he has to be braver than he’s ever been before. Until he discovers that Grandad has left behind a very special surprise just for him.”</p>

Can the children outwit the villains and ensure Mr Toad and his property stay safe?”</p>

<p>An old favourite re-issued with illustrations by Rob Biddulph.</p>

It’s a little unusual, but he finds he can fly like a kite, be sent on holiday through the post and can use his special new skills to catch art thieves.”</p>

Written by Robin Stevens, author of the popular Wells and Wong detective series:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My name is Ted Spark. I am 12 years and 281 days old. I have seven friends. Three months ago, I solved the mystery of how my cousin Salim disappeared from a pod on the London Eye. This is the story of my second mystery.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This summer, I went on holiday to New York, to visit Aunt Gloria and Salim. While I was there, a painting was stolen from the Guggenheim Museum, where Aunt Gloria works. Everyone was very worried and upset. I did not see what the problem was. I do not see the point of paintings, even if they are worth £9.8 million. Perhaps that’s because of my very unusual brain, which works on a different operating system to everyone else’s. But then Aunt Gloria was blamed for the theft - and Aunt Gloria is family.”</p>

<p>The seventh book in the hilarious Treehouse Books series:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Join Andy and Terry in their now 91-storey spectacular treehouse. They’ve added thirteen new levels, including the world’s most powerful whirlpool, a mashed-potato-and-gravy train and a human pinball machine. Why not try your luck on the spin-and-win prize wheel or hang out in a giant spider web (with a giant spider), or you can always get your fortune told by Madam Know-it-all or eat a submarine sandwich the size of an actual submarine while deciding whether or not to push the big red button. Well, what are you waiting for? Come on up!”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As the plane crashes into the canopy, Fred is suddenly left without a choice. He and the three other children may be alive, but the jungle is a vast, untamed place. With no hope of rescue, the chance of getting home feels impossibly small. Except, it seems, someone has been there before them.”</p>
