<h3 id="ten-little-princesses-by-mike-brownlow--simon-rickerty"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55975533?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2839261108%29&amp;QRYTEXT=Ten%20little%20princesses"><cite>Ten little princesses</cite> by Mike Brownlow &amp; Simon Rickerty</a></h3>

<p>If you’re expecting “soppy” find another book, because these princesses are knocked off one by one as they journey through traditional tales on their way to a ball. Memorable rhymes and lots of laughs make this as funny as the companion volume <cite>Ten little pirates</cite> which we also love to love. “Kissy kissy?” said the frog… and then there were seven”. Oh the suspense…</p>

<h3 id="mr-super-poopy-pants-by-rebecca-elliott"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55976508?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%281951497%29&amp;QRYTEXT=Mr%20Super%20Poopy%20Pants"><cite>Mr Super Poopy Pants</cite> by Rebecca Elliott</a></h3>

<p>A tad disappointed when his new baby brother doesn’t want to play, Toby soon discovers that his baby has super-powers that will clear a playground fast.</p>

<h3 id="the-dinosaurs-are-having-a-party-by-gareth-jones--garry-parsons"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55976957?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2839258917%29&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20dinosaurs%20are%20having%20a%20party!"><cite>The Dinosaurs are having a party</cite> by Gareth Jones &amp; Garry Parsons</a></h3>

<p>Dinosaurs are always a favourite in picture books, even when their intentions are less than honourable. But there is an unexpected ending in this rhyming tale of near misses.</p>

<h3 id="enormouse-by-angie-morgan"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/21658733?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25771510)&amp;QRYTEXT=Enormouse"><cite>Enormouse</cite> by Angie Morgan</a></h3>

<p>If you’re looking for a story about friendship and difference, this sweet tale will serve the purpose. Unlike <cite>The Ugly Duckling</cite> who leaves his nest to find acceptance as a swan, Enormouse just can’t settle with the other rats and returns to the welcome companionship of his friends the mice.</p>

<h3 id="were-going-to-a-party-by-jeanne-willis--tony-ross"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55981579?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%281468295%29&amp;QRYTEXT=We%27re%20going%20to%20a%20party!"><cite>We’re going to a party!</cite> by Jeanne Willis &amp; Tony Ross</a></h3>

<p>A group of animals set off in disguise to a fancy dress party “But which of us is What or Who? It’s up to you to guess!” An absolute gem of a book, super to read aloud again and again. I think we may need to buy more copies…</p>

<p>A new series for young readers who have grown up with the Little Princess picture books. The first 2 titles, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55982099?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2838865796%29&amp;QRYTEXT=Best%20friends!"><cite>Best friends</cite></a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55982610?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2838865795%29&amp;QRYTEXT=What%27s%20my%20name%3F"><cite>What’s my name?</cite></a> (it’s Rosie for short, btw) are already in stock and we hope there will be more titles to come for this popular character.</p>

<p>Ava has an imaginary kitten Squishy McFluff, and this is his second book. He’s very naughty indeed and a nightmare to take shopping. But he’s great to read about it you’re a newly confident reader, and wonderful to hear about it you prefer to listen to someone else read.</p>

<p>Did you read about Boyface, his family and their Quantum Chromatic Disruption Machine? No? Well this tartan badger thing is even weirder. But it’s just as full of fab illustrations, perfect for newly confident readers who like their humour crazy. We hear there are more title to come. Can hardly wait.</p>

<h3 id="the-cat-who-came-in-off-the-roof-by-annie-schmidt"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55985591?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2838546219%29&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20cat%20who%20came%20in%20off%20the%20roof"><cite>The Cat who came in off the roof</cite> by Annie Schmidt</a></h3>

<p>“Tibble is a reporter in a spot of trouble: he only ever writes about cats! But Minou might just be the answer to his problems: she’s just moved into his flat and until very recently, she used to be a cat! With her feline friends on the rooftops keeping their ears open for news she might just save his job.”</p>

<p>First published in the Netherlands in the 1970s, this whimsical story about Minou, the cat who turns into a young woman, is set to charm us too. The illustrations by David Colmer are 1970s retro, and the book itself is beautifully produced.</p>

<p>Jessica, the likeable main character, is trying to publish a spoof rule book called <cite>The Parent’s Handbook</cite>, while all her friends at school get involved in the school production of <cite>The Wizard of Oz</cite>.</p>

<p>The book casts a wry look over family life too as Jessica’s dad joins a roof-top protest, her little brother disregards everything but Lego and her big sister is embarrassed by her father. If you enjoy it you’ll be pleased to learn there are other titles about her already My brilliant life and “My best friend and other enemies”. Read them and laugh. Harry Hill does!</p>

<p>A classic and delightful children’s novel that tells the story of young Rebecca Rowena Randall, the mischief she gets into and the difference she makes to the lives of those around her.</p>

<p>Often compared to L.M. Montgomery’s <cite>Anne of Green Gables</cite> and published four years afterwards, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm introduces us to a charming 10 year old heroine who changes the lives of all those she touches.</p>

<p>Set in Riverboro, Maine, this quintessentially American story is a remarkable depiction of rural life in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. We first meet Rebecca when she is on her way to live with her spinster aunts, Miranda and Jane. She has just left behind her the beloved home she grew up in, Sunnybrook Farm, along with her widowed mother and six siblings.</p>

<p>Due to the financial straits her family have found themselves in, it has been deemed best that her aunts take her in and look after her under their own roof. A naturally cheerful and imaginative little girl, Rebecca soon forms a close bond with her Aunt Jane who teaches her to sew, cook and look after the house.</p>

<p>However there remains a shadow over Rebecca’s happiness: the fact that she has never quite won over her Aunt Miranda’s affections. But slowly Rebecca is growing up into a mature and thoughtful young lady. And when her mother falls ill and Rebecca is forced to look after her old farmstead home as well as her ailing mother, it may just be that Miranda has grown fond of her niece after all.</p>

<h3 id="the-apple-tart-of-hope-by-sarah-moore-fitzgerald"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55987997?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2837213544%29&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20apple%20tart%20of%20hope"><cite>The apple tart of hope</cite> by Sarah Moore Fitzgerald</a></h3>

<p>When Meg leaves with her family for an extended stay in New Zealand, Oscar her best friend and neighbour, is so humiliated by the girl who moves in next door, that he leaves home. The novel explores the fragile self-esteem of a young teenage boy. Luckily there is a happy resolution to this challenging story. Another excellent book by this newly published author.</p>

<h3 id="night-runner-by-tim-bowler"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55988715?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2839647626%29&amp;QRYTEXT=Night%20runner"><cite>Night runner</cite> by Tim Bowler</a></h3>

<p>In order to protect his mum and dad from a criminal gang, Zinny becomes their runner in this gripping edge-of-your-seat drama. The story ends happily, but it’s not for the feint hearted. Be aware that the novel includes “conversational swearing” and some violence.</p>

<h3 id="dont-tell-mum-by-simon-hoggart-ebook"><a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/98FA403D-E3F4-4098-BB2E-950BEAF63253/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=9CADDA6D-A13B-4E40-87A5-841C190EEFFE"><cite>Don’t Tell Mum</cite> by Simon Hoggart</a> (eBook)</h3>

<p>The email home is an essential part of every gap-year traveller’s journey. Where once the news of narrowly surviving a bus crash on the dirt-roads of India, waking up to gunfire in Honduras or fending off marriage proposals from complete strangers would have made it home only on the back of a slow-moving battered postcard, these days those tantalizing details and terrible mistakes are now recorded immediately and distributed liberally for every friend and family member to wince at.</p>

<p>In <cite>Don’t Tell Mum</cite>, Simon Hoggart and Emily Monk have collected together the funniest, most surreal, most alarming gap-year emails into a treasure-trove of correspondence. Accompanied by their wicked commentary, it gives the aspiring traveller the low-down on what not to do when trotting the globe.</p>
