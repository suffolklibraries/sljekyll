<blockquote>
  <p>“Fionn Boyle and his older sister Tara have been sent to stay with their grandfather on the remote island of Arranmore for the summer. Though Fionn has never met his grandfather before - an eccentric old man who lives in a tiny cottage filled to the brim with candles - he knows he comes from a long line of brave lifeboat men, who wear the sea behind their eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fionn is scared of the sea. He has no interest in adventure or shipwrecks or the restless wind that rustles through the island, as though in search of something. But an old magic is stirring deep inside the layers of Arranmore, and it is calling out to Fionn.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“A story of family, memory, courage and sacrifice interlaced with Irish myths and legends” – Fiona Noble, <cite>The Bookseller</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On a visit to the US things take a strange turn for 12-year-old Ajay when, completely at random and totally by accident, he is sworn in as the new president. Well, I guess he can’t be any worse than that guy who had the job before him, right?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“11-year-old Birdy Jones is all alone. She doesn’t belong at school, at home, or even with her dad anymore. The only place she feels like herself is at her grandpa’s pigeon loft, where the familiar warmth and birdsong block out the world. It’s also where she meets Dogger - her only friend and the one person who really seems to know where she’s coming from.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Birdy used to be happy, when it was just her and Dad, but now she has a stepmum, a little sister, and another baby on the way. Worse, her growing family needs to move house, but Birdy doesn’t believe there’ll ever be enough room for her in Dad’s busy life - and she can’t leave Grandpa and the pigeons.”</p>
