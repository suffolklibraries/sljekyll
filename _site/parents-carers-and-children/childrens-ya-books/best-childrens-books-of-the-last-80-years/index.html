<p>A poll commissioned by the CILIP Carnegie and Kate Greenaway Medals has revealed the UK’s favourite books from the past 80 years. These are 15 books published between 1936 and 1997 that parents especially loved as children and have in turn read to their children, or encouraged them to read themselves.</p>

<p>The list is dominated by Roald Dahl, who takes the top three places. The oldest entry on the list is <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, by J. R. R. Tolkein and the newest is <cite>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</cite>, by J. K. Rowling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Giants are known for eating children. So when Sophie is snatched from her bed by the BFG, she fears for her life. But luckily he is far more jumbly than his disgusting neighbours. They become good friends and cook up a plan to rid the world of bad giants.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A much-loved classic, The Very Hungry Caterpillar has won over millions of readers with its vivid and colourful collage illustrations and its deceptively simply, hopeful story. With its die-cut pages and finger-sized holes to explore, this is a richly satisfying book for children.”</p>
