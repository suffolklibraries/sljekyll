For the purpose of these Conditions of Use, the following definitions are used:
  </p>
  <p>
Display: the use of space to inform or entertain customers by means of posters, illustrative materials and/or leaflets.
  </p>
  <p>
Exhibition: the use of space to promote the sale and/or appreciation of works of art and craft, or the sale of other items of a commercial nature.
  </p>
  <p>
Meeting: the use of space to allow people to meet for a specific purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
Hirer: the person who makes an application to hire library premises in accordance with these Conditions of Use whether on his/her behalf or on behalf of an organisation. The Hirer is responsible for ensuring that these Conditions of Use and any other additional requests made by the library manager are adhered to.
  </p>
  <p>
1) All displays, exhibitions and meetings arranged to take place on library premises are conditional upon the judgement of the appropriate library manager that their subjects and presentation do not contravene any law or regulation, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing in particular in the fields of libel or religious hatred, obscenity or riotous assembly.
  </p>
  <p>
2) The judgement of the local library manager determines what material may be displayed or exhibited, and the period and circumstances of the display or exhibition. The decision of the local library manager is final. Displays and exhibitions are accepted on the condition that they are suitable to be viewed by all library customers and that they provide accurate information in a reasoned and thoughtful manner; propaganda is not acceptable.
  </p>
  <p>
3) In approving the use of library premises for the display of matters of public interest or as a part of the process of public debate, Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd implies no interest in, or responsibility for, the views expressed, unless the items are themselves the official publications of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd.
  </p>

  <p>
    4) Except for the purposes of the Representation of the People Act, library premises may not be used during the five week period preceding national or local elections if in the judgement of a local library manager a display, exhibition or meeting has a political content.
  </p>

  <p>
    5) There must be no advertisement on the outside of the library building of any display, exhibition or meeting that has a political content, or is arranged on behalf of a political organisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    6) Leaflets and publications may be left with a display or exhibition on a self-help basis. The active distribution of material is not permitted without the prior written approval of the library manager, nor may such material be left out for sale.
  </p>

  <p>
    7) All displays and exhibitions must carry a disclaimer of sufficient size and prominence to compete on equal terms with the rest of the display. The disclaimer shall read: Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd accepts in good faith the material submitted for display or exhibition by members of the community, and we cannot be held responsible for its quality of accuracy.
  </p>

  <p>
    8) No internal or external promotion of a display or exhibition shall be undertaken without the prior written agreement of the library manager.

The Hirer is deemed to be the “responsible person” for any damage howsoever caused during the period of hire. This includes damage to furniture, fabric, fixtures and fittings. Suffolk Libraries will recharge any costs incurred for repairs direct to the Hirer in addition to the hire charge. Where a deposit has been paid, this will be used to contribute to such costs.<br /> c) the Hirer shall not disclose any security codes for alarm or door systems that are made known to him/her, unless it is in the interest of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd to do so.<br /> d) acquaint him/herself and others in the group, if appropriate, with the emergency and evacuation procedures for the building. In addition the Hirer is to ensure that fire exits are kept clear at all times and that fire doors are not wedged open.<br /> e) nominate a named person to take responsibility for the security and safety of the Room, if no library staff are on duty at the time of hiring, and for ensuring that emergency and evacuation procedures are followed in the event of an emergency;<br /> f) not bring their own electrical equipment unless it has been tested by an approved or suitably qualified person;<br /> g) leave the premises in a clean and tidy condition.
