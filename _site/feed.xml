&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15250463?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(203217)&amp;amp;QRYTEXT=Dylan%2C%20Bob%2C%201941-&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/fallen-angels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fallen angels by Bob Dylan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Dylan follows &lt;cite&gt;Shadows in the Night&lt;/cite&gt; with his 37th studio album. This one draws on the tunes of some of America’s greatest songwriters including Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn and Harold Arlen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth solo album from The Verve lead singer. &lt;cite&gt;These People&lt;/cite&gt; is the first new album in six years from the Brit and Ivor Novello award winning artist. It was produced by Ashcroft and marks a reunion with Wil Malone, who worked on the string arrangements on The Verve’s &lt;cite&gt;A Northern Soul&lt;/cite&gt; (1995), &lt;cite&gt;Urban Hymns&lt;/cite&gt; (1997), and the platinum-selling debut solo album &lt;cite&gt;Alone with Everybody&lt;/cite&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23rd solo album from Eric Clapton. This one features a combination of new material as well as cover versions of classic songs, contemporary tunes and influences Clapton has interpreted in his own style. It also features the track &lt;cite&gt;I will be there&lt;/cite&gt; featuring one “Angelo Mysterioso” who may or may not be George Harrison according to speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indie heroes return with the follow-up to their massive-selling debut, &lt;cite&gt;The Balcony&lt;/cite&gt;. They say their album consists of songs that were ‘made to play live’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second part of the two-part album based around collaborations with other electronic musicians from a wide range of decades and styles. This one features contributions from Pet Shop Boys, Primal Scream and Gary Numan amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always great to have new material from Beth Orton. Four years after her last album Beth returns with more trippy electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third album from CBR. This one “is about transformation and new life and confidence and joy” and finding beauty in life’s tragedies and triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-dont-you-leave-me-here-my-life.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t you leave me here: my life by Wilko Johnson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8638783?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(61025476)&amp;amp;QRYTEXT=Don%27t%20you%20leave%20me%20here%20%3A%20my%20life&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/dont-you-leave-me-here-my-life.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t you leave me here: my life by Wilko Johnson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Dr Feelgood founder Wilko Johnson was diagnosed with terminal cancer. With ten months to live, he decided to accept his imminent death and went on the road. He recorded Going Back Home with Roger Daltrey and prepared for the worst. Then the strangest thing happened: he didn’t die. ‘Don’t You Leave Me Here’ is the story of his life in music, his life with cancer, and his life now - in the future he never thought he would see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tudor monarchs were constantly surrounded by an army of attendants, courtiers and ministers. Even in their most private moments, they were accompanied by a servant specifically appointed for the task. A groom of the stool would stand patiently by as Henry VIII performed his daily purges, and when Elizabeth I retired for the evening, one of her female servants would sleep at the end of her bed. These attendants knew the truth behind the glamorous exterior and this book reveals the previously unexamined details about the characters we think we know so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book offers a first-hand, insider’s account of the life of a member of one of the most influential and widely-imitated band of all time, making this a fascinating fly-on-the-wall chronicle. Philip Norman has previously published definitive books on The Beatles and John Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even by the standards of a sport that requires enormous stamina and capacity for suffering, Jens Voigt is in a class on his own. Beloved by cycling fans for his madcap one-man breakaways as much as his sense of humour and quotable catchphrases, Jens is one of the most popular personalities in cycling. This book is a funny, insightful, and entertaining look at the tough realities of professional cycling, told in Jens’s trademark irreverent and inimitable style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 Alexander and his friends found 148 journals discarded in a skip. This book describes Alexander’s attempts to unravel the mysterious writer of these journals – leading us into the oddly fascinating life of an entirely unremarkable person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Calman will be familiar to listeners of The News Quiz on Radio 4. You may not know that she also suffers from depression. Despite being one of the funniest women in the UK she has had her own black dog, the Crab of Hate , whispering in her ear since she can remember. And her answer? To talk about it. A woman who measures the length of her depression by box sets (‘Cracker’ good, ‘West Wing’ bad) and who has made therapy more of a hobby than a medical requirement, Susan has written the book on what’s it’s like to be gloomy and enjoy it. Certain that the world needs people with a more cynical outlook on life, the book is a celebration of what she, and if statistics are to be believed, one in four of us, go through daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, Alan Garner has enraptured generations of readers with works like The Weirdstone of Brisingamen , The Owl Service , Red Shift , and The Stone Book Quartet .

&lt;p&gt;The author of The Suspicions of Mr Whicher returns to Victorian crime. Early in the morning of Monday 8 July 1895, 13-year-old Robert Coombes and his 12-year-old brother Nattie set out from their small terraced house in East London to watch a cricket match at Lord’s. Their father had gone to sea the previous Friday, the boys told their neighbours, and their mother was visiting her family in Liverpool. Over the next ten days Robert and Nattie spent extravagantly, pawning their parents’ valuables to fund trips to the theatre and the seaside. But as the sun beat down on the Coombes house, a strange smell began to emanate from the building.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mrs Hemingway by Naomi Wood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-mrs-hemingway.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mrs Hemingway by Naomi Wood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an intriguing novel centred on the four marriages of American author Ernest Hemingway. It’s an intense portrait of their lives together and an eloquent window into their world rather than a polemic: The reader may become frustrated and unsympathetic with their often heartless and selfish behaviour but in the end it’s a keen and honest observation of love, loneliness and obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the afterword, Mrs Hemingway is a work of fiction, but the prose is so good and the characters so vivid that it becomes as believable as a work of non-fiction. Largely structured around the beginning and end of each relationship, the novels first chapters are set in Antibes with Hemingway, his first wife Hadley and mistress Fife on holiday together. It’s a very clever and surprisingly enjoyable read and by the end it is very hard not be moved and hungry to learn more about these larger than life characters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead by Tom Stoppard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead by Tom Stoppard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off.” Tom Stoppard’s most famous play is exactly that; following two minor characters from &lt;cite&gt;Hamlet&lt;/cite&gt;, Stoppard’s 1966 play could be described as a behind-the-scenes peek at the most dodgy Danish court in literature. But that would only scratch the metaphorical surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern suffer from a common post-modern literary condition; the unsettling suspicion that they are both actually fictional. With only small appearances in Shakespeare’s play, in Stoppard’s version, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find themselves at a loose end for much of the time, left to hang around with little idea of what exactly is going on. As a great comedy writer, Stoppard manages this plot – or lack of it – with finesse. Whereas Shakespeare creates an obsequious, unlikeable pair, you can’t help but feel for Stoppard’s reluctant protagonists, who worry about how to engage the ‘stark raving sane’ Hamlet in conversation, who are bemused by the continuous exits and entrances of the rest of the cast, and who are, in the end, simply trying to follow bewildering instructions from on high as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a novel, but it’s still a page-turner, as you follow Ros and Guil through the mires of fictional existential crisis to their untimely end (which, considering the title, shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.) In Shakespeare’s entirely different play, Hamlet agonises famously over ‘to be or not to be’; in Stoppard’s quirky, undefinable masterpiece, Rosencrantz advises, “I wouldn’t think about it, if I were you. You’d only get depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6309508?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(376656)&amp;amp;QRYTEXT=Rosencrantz%20and%20Guildenstern%20are%20Dead&quot;&gt;Order &lt;cite&gt;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead&lt;/cite&gt; from our catalogue →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suffolk Libraries launches new scheme to support young people’s mental health</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is getting behind a national scheme to support young people with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Reading Well for young people’ is a new scheme which provides expert information and a recommended reading list to help tackle some of the mental health and wellbeing issues that young people face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is being launched today (12 April) and is part of the hugely successful Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme which is already available through the library service. Reading Well for young people is aimed at 13-18 year-olds and provides high-quality information, support and advice on a wide-range of issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and self-harm, and difficult life pressures, like bullying and exams. The number of 15-16 year olds experiencing anxiety or depression has doubled in the last 30 years and 1 in 10 young people have a diagnosable mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme has been developed with the help of a panel of young people who have had experience of mental health issues. The books can be recommended by GPs, school nurses, counsellors and other health professionals as well as being free to borrow from the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is delivered by The Reading Agency in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians and the Association of Senior Children’s and Education Librarians. It is funded by Arts Council England and the Wellcome Trust and is supported by a range of health organisations including NHS England (IAPT), Public Health England, Mental Health Foundation, Mind and YoungMinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries already supports the Books on Prescription programme and is unique in having a dedicated Mental Health and Wellbeing Co-ordinator who works to ensure library visitors can get access to the health and wellbeing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries and a member of the Society of Chief Librarians, said: “I am very pleased that Suffolk Libraries will be supporting this very positive new programme. We know that young people may face many challenges and issues and may not always know where to turn for help. Libraries can play a key role in providing access to reading materials and information which can make a real difference to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is also hosting an event aimed at helping schools to promote reading as a way of tackling mental health or crisis in young people. ‘Building Wellness through Reading’ takes place at the IP-City centre in Ipswich on Friday 27 May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: “Libraries can play a significant role in the health of local communities by providing free access to advice and information for people of all ages. This important new scheme uses libraries, books and reading to reach out to young people to help them manage their mental health and wellbeing, and cope with the pressures of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Well for young people’s recommended reading list of 35 books were selected by mental health experts and young people. The list includes a wide range of self-help and information titles, as well as fiction, including hugely influential novels such as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information on the new scheme at &lt;a href=&quot;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&quot;&gt;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public libraries have offered support to adults with common mental health needs since 2013 through Reading Well Books on Prescription. The Reading Well for young people list of 35 recommended books will soon be available from all library services along with supporting leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates of mental health problems increase as young people reach adolescence. Poor mental health for young people has serious implications for later life, affecting wellbeing and the ability to work and earn as adults. The core booklist for Reading Well for young people is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The magic finger by Roald Dahl</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-the-magic-finger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The magic finger by Roald Dahl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strange and short little morality tale for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows an eight-year-old girl and the Gregg family on the farm next door. Mr Gregg and his sons love to hunt with guns. This infuriates the girl. Her rage causes her to put the ‘Magic Finger’ on them. She loses control and curses people with a bolt of magic that shoots from her finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her frustration grew when the Greggs refused to listen to her pleas to cease hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, they awake to find they’ve shrunk to the size of birds and have ducks’ wings in place of arms. Furthermore, a family of ducks has grown man-sized and have human arms in place of wings and they take over the Greggs’ home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will the Greggs fare when forced to build a nest and find food?! Or when the ducks shoot at them?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message of the book is anti-blood sports and about not acting without thinking. The girl regrets her past actions regarding her gift, but as the story progresses we see her learn to gain control. This is Roald Dahl at his creative, zany best, teaching children to use what upsets them to engage their imagination before acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tale demonstrates the need for empathy. The Greggs learn, not only how the ducks feel at being shot at, but also what their lives entail daily, trying to survive. It teaches children to fully consider others before acting carelessly or cruelly against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little book has the perfect blend of humour, imagination, and moral guidance. It is also short and fairly easy to read which can offer reluctant or struggling young readers plenty of confidence when they can finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Code Club in our Enterprise + Innovation Hub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m the assistant library manager at Ipswich County Library. As part of my role I have responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/hub&quot;&gt;Enterprise and Innovation Hub&lt;/a&gt; located on the top floor of the library, which is where our weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeclub.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Code Club&lt;/a&gt; is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Code Club a while ago while carrying out a volunteer role I have outside of the library. The concept interested me, but at that point I wasn’t in a position to be able to move forward. When I started at Ipswich County Library in August 2015 I was quite keen to investigate the idea of a Code Club further. By coincidence a volunteer came in to ask if we could start a Code Club in the library. I didn’t need asking twice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up our Code Club with a combination of volunteers; Code Club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stemnet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;STEMnet&lt;/a&gt; and high school students. I started off with one volunteer who was very proactive getting other volunteers on board — she continues to be extremely helpful and is an active volunteer at the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/eadt-first-library-code-club-a-big-success.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Newspaper cutting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Code Club was featured in the local paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each session we generally have 2 Code Club/STEM volunteers and a couple of High School students. The High School students focus on troubleshooting IT and this allows the Code Club/STEM volunteers to interact with the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group started off at 8 children, after the first group of sessions this was increased to 14. The children range in age from 6-11, the youngest children generally have their parents helping them with the material and the group work well together. We don’t have a rigid structure where the children work systematically through the projects. Instead the children choose their own projects to suit their interest and ability working at their own level — if they choose one that is too hard or too easy they soon change it for another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/code-club-two-men-and-three-children.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Children at laptops&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coding in the hub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest challenge for our Code Club is also our greatest triumph. The club has been more popular than I imagined. The waiting list continues to grow faster than we can create spaces in our club! I’m now considering starting a second Code Club. I’ve approached a local college who have Level 3 Game Design and IT students to see any of them would like to gain some valuable work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to anyone else working in a library and considering starting a Code Club would be: Go for it, what have you got to lose? It’s a really great experience to see the children engaged and learning at a Club they have chosen to come to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Southwold Library launches fourth Crime Writers Festival</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Southwold Library will again be running the ‘Slaughter in Southwold’ festival this summer. The increasingly popular Crime Writers Festival will feature a number of top crime writers giving talks about their writing at Reydon Village Hall on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaughter in Southwold is organised by Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark with support from the Friends of Southwold Library and the Crime Writers Association. The event is also part of the Southwold Arts Festival and Suffolk Libraries’ Year of Reading campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s packed programme features talks by Helen Callaghan, Hugh Fraser, Paul Harrison, Suzette A. Hill, Andrew Hook, Peter James, Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly, Renee Knight, Anya Lipska and Kate Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival programme also includes an opportunity to have lunch with the authors on the Saturday and Sunday and there is a workshop for budding crime writers. There is also a fun crime quiz on the Saturday evening and raffle tickets are on sale now with the chance of winning a luxury crime-related hamper. Beccles Books will also be providing books by the authors for sale so there will be a chance to buy books and get them signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Clark, Southwold Library Manager said: “I’m really thrilled we’ve put together another great programme of author talks and other activities. Crime is one of the best loved genres of books and we’ve got a very diverse range of writers taking part this year. I hope many people will join us for what will hopefully be a fun and interesting series of events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details of the programme and ticketing information is available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/slaughter&quot;&gt;www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/slaughter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold&quot;&gt;www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold&lt;/a&gt;. Tickets can also be bought at the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter James is one of the UK’s most treasured crime and thriller novelists. His Roy Grace detective novels have sold over 17 million copies worldwide in total. Before becoming a full time novelist he has produced numerous films, including &lt;cite&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/cite&gt;, starring Al Pacino. Both a film and a TV adaptation of the Roy Grace series are currently in development. Peter has been two-times Chair of the Crime Writers’ Association and has won many literary awards, including the publicly voted ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards People’s Bestseller Dagger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Fraser is best known as the actor who played Captain Hastings alongside David Suchet’s Poirot in the long running and much loved television series. In July 2015, Hugh made his debut as a writer with his first novel, &lt;cite&gt;Harm&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Harrison is a retired police officer who was an undercover football hooligan and was one of the first British police officers to work with the FBI psychological serial killer profiling unit in Quantico. He is now the best-selling author of 35 books and as a media, crime and police consultant is behind the creation of many of the well-known television detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly and Kate Rhodes represent Killer Women, a group of London-based crime writers. Their talk will bring the world of crime fiction to life as they discuss how men and women relate to violence in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Joseph is the author of the series of novels featuring Sister Agnes, a contemporary detective nun. &lt;cite&gt;Murder Will Out&lt;/cite&gt; is the first of a new series featuring Agatha Christie as a detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erin Kelly is best known for her debut novel, &lt;cite&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/cite&gt;, which was a major ITV drama and a Richard and Judy Bestseller. She is the author of three more acclaimed psychological thrillers as well as the official novel of the Bafta-winning Broadchurch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Rhodes has published four novels in the Alice Quentin series and will also be hosting a workshop on how to write a crime novel during the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzette A. Hill has published nine novels including the humorous Reverend Oughterard quintet (A Load of Old Bones etc.) and the subsequent Rosy Gilchrist series, the latest being &lt;cite&gt;A Southwold Mystery&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anya Lipska writes detective thrillers featuring Janusz Kiszka, private eye to London’s Polish community, and police detective DC Natalie Kershaw. Her trilogy may soon be made into a BBC Drama. Anya also works as a TV producer with credits on a dizzying variety of programmes from &lt;cite&gt;Panorama&lt;/cite&gt; to &lt;cite&gt;Monty Don’s Italian Gardens&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renée Knight worked for the BBC directing arts documentaries before turning to writing. She has had TV and film scripts commissioned by the BBC, Channel Four and Capital Films. &lt;cite&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/cite&gt; is her first novel arising from that course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local crime writers Helen Callaghan and Andrew Hook are both local writers. Helen’s first novel, &lt;cite&gt;Dear Amy&lt;/cite&gt;, is to be published in hardcover by Michael Joseph in spring 2016 and Andrew is a much-published Norwich-based author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are £5 for an individual talk or it’s £15 for a day pass or £30 for the whole weekend. The crime writing workshop is £5 and not included in day passes. Lunches also need to be booked separately. Anyone needing more information can contact the library on 01502 722519. All events take place at Reydon Village Hall and not the library.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet the author: Julia Blackburn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Julia Blackburn has written several non-fiction books including her memoir, &lt;cite&gt;The Three of Us: A Family Story&lt;/cite&gt;, which was shortlisted for the J R Ackerly Award, and &lt;cite&gt;Thin Paths&lt;/cite&gt;, which was shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award and the Ondaatje Prize. She has also written two novels: &lt;cite&gt;The Book of Colour&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;The Leper’s Companions&lt;/cite&gt;, both of which were shortlisted for the Orange Prize. Her latest book, &lt;cite&gt;Threads: The Delicate Life of John Craske&lt;/cite&gt; was published in April 2015. It has been a favourite in Suffolk Libraries ever since and was one of our books of the year for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia recently took time out from writing her latest book to answer some questions for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; was a massive word of mouth success in Suffolk Libraries. As I check now it is still issuing well. What drew you to the story of John Craske?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to write about John Craske, after a friend of mine mentioned him and how good his work was and how he’d been almost forgotten. I went to the Glanford Shell Museum where they have a beautiful long tapestry pinned on a high wall in full view of the daylight and then to Snape which has a big collection of paintings and embroideries, but none of them on show and I think that was when I decided I wanted to fight his corner. He was a poor fisherman from Sheringham on the North Norfolk coast, an area which I know and love. He moved inland and helped with the family fish shop, but became a chronic invalid being cared for by his devoted wife. When he was in his mid 30s he started to paint the sea and boats on the sea and then later he began the embroideries which he could do while lying in bed. I felt he was an artist in the truest sense and his art gave him a voice as it were, enabling him to find quiet and a certain wisdom in an otherwise impossible situation. The fact of there being so little known about him, made it into an interesting challenge; a biography without much biographical material. I realised I was free to allow my book to drift in any direction and so it became the story of the people I met or heard about as I was doing my rather haphazard researches and then bit by bit my own story became part of it as well, one of the many threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have written in a variety of formats. Which one do you feel most comfortable in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing for me has always been an exploration. I have done a wide range of subjects and formats but I think all my books have been a way of understanding myself through understanding other people and the predicaments they are faced with. I have never felt tied to a particular form and each new book has taken the shape that seemed to suit it best. With &lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; I enjoyed the fact that the pictures were made as important as the text; there are a lot of things that can be better said with images, rather than with words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have written about some fascinating people, many of whom had life changing experiences. Is there anyone you would still like to write about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that I have written about all sorts of very different people in very different situations – Napoleon dying on St Helena; Goya finding himself deaf; Billie Holiday trying to survive in the racist world of America in the 1940s and 50s… The list goes on, but I have no idea in advance of what other lives I might want to explore. In &lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; and in my previous book &lt;cite&gt;Thin Paths&lt;/cite&gt;, I really enjoyed talking to people and simply looking at the world around them and that fascination is part of what I am working on now. It will be a book without a main character, which is a new departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any news of &lt;cite&gt;Angels Dancing On A Pin&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Angels on a Pin&lt;/cite&gt; is half done, but I keep getting distracted by other plans, so I am not sure when it will be ready. I have written a poem for it which begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a writing woman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who uses words as best she can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To jump from fire to frying pan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From frying pan to pastures green&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With intermezzos in between&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chasing all the words that spin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like angels, dancing on a pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your perfect day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect day? Walking along the coast here, or in the mountains of Northern Italy where I still have a little house, with a good companion, not too much talk, a bit of sunshine and a few brief encounters with birds and animals, the landscape and the weather, alongside maybe one or two fellow human beings on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
