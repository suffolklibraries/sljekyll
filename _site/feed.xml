        <title>Suffolk Libraries launches new scheme to support young people’s mental health</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is getting behind a national scheme to support young people with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Reading Well for young people’ is a new scheme which provides expert information and a recommended reading list to help tackle some of the mental health and wellbeing issues that young people face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is being launched today (12 April) and is part of the hugely successful Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme which is already available through the library service. Reading Well for young people is aimed at 13-18 year-olds and provides high-quality information, support and advice on a wide-range of issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and self-harm, and difficult life pressures, like bullying and exams. The number of 15-16 year olds experiencing anxiety or depression has doubled in the last 30 years and 1 in 10 young people have a diagnosable mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme has been developed with the help of a panel of young people who have had experience of mental health issues. The books can be recommended by GPs, school nurses, counsellors and other health professionals as well as being free to borrow from the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is delivered by The Reading Agency in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians and the Association of Senior Children’s and Education Librarians. It is funded by Arts Council England and the Wellcome Trust and is supported by a range of health organisations including NHS England (IAPT), Public Health England, Mental Health Foundation, Mind and YoungMinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries already supports the Books on Prescription programme and is unique in having a dedicated Mental Health and Wellbeing Co-ordinator who works to ensure library visitors can get access to the health and wellbeing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries and a member of the Society of Chief Librarians, said: “I am very pleased that Suffolk Libraries will be supporting this very positive new programme. We know that young people may face many challenges and issues and may not always know where to turn for help. Libraries can play a key role in providing access to reading materials and information which can make a real difference to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is also hosting an event aimed at helping schools to promote reading as a way of tackling mental health or crisis in young people. ‘Building Wellness through Reading’ takes place at the IP-City centre in Ipswich on Friday 27 May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: “Libraries can play a significant role in the health of local communities by providing free access to advice and information for people of all ages. This important new scheme uses libraries, books and reading to reach out to young people to help them manage their mental health and wellbeing, and cope with the pressures of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Well for young people’s recommended reading list of 35 books were selected by mental health experts and young people. The list includes a wide range of self-help and information titles, as well as fiction, including hugely influential novels such as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information on the new scheme at &lt;a href=&quot;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&quot;&gt;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public libraries have offered support to adults with common mental health needs since 2013 through Reading Well Books on Prescription. The Reading Well for young people list of 35 recommended books will soon be available from all library services along with supporting leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates of mental health problems increase as young people reach adolescence. Poor mental health for young people has serious implications for later life, affecting wellbeing and the ability to work and earn as adults. The core booklist for Reading Well for young people is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Code Club in our Enterprise + Innovation Hub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m the assistant library manager at Ipswich County Library. As part of my role I have responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/hub&quot;&gt;Enterprise and Innovation Hub&lt;/a&gt; located on the top floor of the library, which is where our weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeclub.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Code Club&lt;/a&gt; is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Code Club a while ago while carrying out a volunteer role I have outside of the library. The concept interested me, but at that point I wasn’t in a position to be able to move forward. When I started at Ipswich County Library in August 2015 I was quite keen to investigate the idea of a Code Club further. By coincidence a volunteer came in to ask if we could start a Code Club in the library. I didn’t need asking twice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up our Code Club with a combination of volunteers; Code Club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stemnet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;STEMnet&lt;/a&gt; and high school students. I started off with one volunteer who was very proactive getting other volunteers on board — she continues to be extremely helpful and is an active volunteer at the sessions.&lt;figure class=&quot;figure aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eadt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Newspaper cutting&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Our Code Club was featured in the local paper.&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each session we generally have 2 Code Club/STEM volunteers and a couple of High School students. The High School students focus on troubleshooting IT and this allows the Code Club/STEM volunteers to interact with the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group started off at 8 children, after the first group of sessions this was increased to 14. The children range in age from 6-11, the youngest children generally have their parents helping them with the material and the group work well together. We don’t have a rigid structure where the children work systematically through the projects. Instead the children choose their own projects to suit their interest and ability working at their own level — if they choose one that is too hard or too easy they soon change it for another one.&lt;figure class=&quot;figure aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/code-club.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Children at laptops&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Coding in the hub&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest challenge for our Code Club is also our greatest triumph. The club has been more popular than I imagined. The waiting list continues to grow faster than we can create spaces in our club! I’m now considering starting a second Code Club. I’ve approached a local college who have Level 3 Game Design and IT students to see any of them would like to gain some valuable work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to anyone else working in a library and considering starting a Code Club would be: Go for it, what have you got to lose? It’s a really great experience to see the children engaged and learning at a Club they have chosen to come to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Southwold Library launches fourth Crime Writers Festival</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Southwold Library will again be running the ‘Slaughter in Southwold’ festival this summer. The increasingly popular Crime Writers Festival will feature a number of top crime writers giving talks about their writing at Reydon Village Hall on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaughter in Southwold is organised by Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark with support from the Friends of Southwold Library and the Crime Writers Association. The event is also part of the Southwold Arts Festival and Suffolk Libraries’ Year of Reading campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s packed programme features talks by Helen Callaghan, Hugh Fraser, Paul Harrison, Suzette A. Hill, Andrew Hook, Peter James, Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly, Renee Knight, Anya Lipska and Kate Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival programme also includes an opportunity to have lunch with the authors on the Saturday and Sunday and there is a workshop for budding crime writers. There is also a fun crime quiz on the Saturday evening and raffle tickets are on sale now with the chance of winning a luxury crime-related hamper. Beccles Books will also be providing books by the authors for sale so there will be a chance to buy books and get them signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Clark, Southwold Library Manager said: “I’m really thrilled we’ve put together another great programme of author talks and other activities. Crime is one of the best loved genres of books and we’ve got a very diverse range of writers taking part this year. I hope many people will join us for what will hopefully be a fun and interesting series of events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details of the programme and ticketing information is available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/slaughter&quot;&gt;www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/slaughter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold&quot;&gt;www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold&lt;/a&gt;. Tickets can also be bought at the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter James is one of the UK’s most treasured crime and thriller novelists. His Roy Grace detective novels have sold over 17 million copies worldwide in total. Before becoming a full time novelist he has produced numerous films, including &lt;cite&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/cite&gt;, starring Al Pacino. Both a film and a TV adaptation of the Roy Grace series are currently in development. Peter has been two-times Chair of the Crime Writers’ Association and has won many literary awards, including the publicly voted ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards People’s Bestseller Dagger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Fraser is best known as the actor who played Captain Hastings alongside David Suchet’s Poirot in the long running and much loved television series. In July 2015, Hugh made his debut as a writer with his first novel, &lt;cite&gt;Harm&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Harrison is a retired police officer who was an undercover football hooligan and was one of the first British police officers to work with the FBI psychological serial killer profiling unit in Quantico. He is now the best-selling author of 35 books and as a media, crime and police consultant is behind the creation of many of the well-known television detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly and Kate Rhodes represent Killer Women, a group of London-based crime writers. Their talk will bring the world of crime fiction to life as they discuss how men and women relate to violence in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Joseph is the author of the series of novels featuring Sister Agnes, a contemporary detective nun. &lt;cite&gt;Murder Will Out&lt;/cite&gt; is the first of a new series featuring Agatha Christie as a detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erin Kelly is best known for her debut novel, &lt;cite&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/cite&gt;, which was a major ITV drama and a Richard and Judy Bestseller. She is the author of three more acclaimed psychological thrillers as well as the official novel of the Bafta-winning Broadchurch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Rhodes has published four novels in the Alice Quentin series and will also be hosting a workshop on how to write a crime novel during the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzette A. Hill has published nine novels including the humorous Reverend Oughterard quintet (A Load of Old Bones etc.) and the subsequent Rosy Gilchrist series, the latest being &lt;cite&gt;A Southwold Mystery&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anya Lipska writes detective thrillers featuring Janusz Kiszka, private eye to London’s Polish community, and police detective DC Natalie Kershaw. Her trilogy may soon be made into a BBC Drama. Anya also works as a TV producer with credits on a dizzying variety of programmes from &lt;cite&gt;Panorama&lt;/cite&gt; to &lt;cite&gt;Monty Don’s Italian Gardens&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renée Knight worked for the BBC directing arts documentaries before turning to writing. She has had TV and film scripts commissioned by the BBC, Channel Four and Capital Films. &lt;cite&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/cite&gt; is her first novel arising from that course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local crime writers Helen Callaghan and Andrew Hook are both local writers. Helen’s first novel, &lt;cite&gt;Dear Amy&lt;/cite&gt;, is to be published in hardcover by Michael Joseph in spring 2016 and Andrew is a much-published Norwich-based author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are £5 for an individual talk or it’s £15 for a day pass or £30 for the whole weekend. The crime writing workshop is £5 and not included in day passes. Lunches also need to be booked separately. Anyone needing more information can contact the library on 01502 722519. All events take place at Reydon Village Hall and not the library.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet the author: Julia Blackburn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Julia Blackburn has written several non-fiction books including her memoir, &lt;cite&gt;The Three of Us: A Family Story&lt;/cite&gt;, which was shortlisted for the J R Ackerly Award, and &lt;cite&gt;Thin Paths&lt;/cite&gt;, which was shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award and the Ondaatje Prize. She has also written two novels: &lt;cite&gt;The Book of Colour&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;The Leper’s Companions&lt;/cite&gt;, both of which were shortlisted for the Orange Prize. Her latest book, &lt;cite&gt;Threads: The Delicate Life of John Craske&lt;/cite&gt; was published in April 2015. It has been a favourite in Suffolk Libraries ever since and was one of our books of the year for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia recently took time out from writing her latest book to answer some questions for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; was a massive word of mouth success in Suffolk Libraries. As I check now it is still issuing well. What drew you to the story of John Craske?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to write about John Craske, after a friend of mine mentioned him and how good his work was and how he’d been almost forgotten. I went to the Glanford Shell Museum where they have a beautiful long tapestry pinned on a high wall in full view of the daylight and then to Snape which has a big collection of paintings and embroideries, but none of them on show and I think that was when I decided I wanted to fight his corner. He was a poor fisherman from Sheringham on the North Norfolk coast, an area which I know and love. He moved inland and helped with the family fish shop, but became a chronic invalid being cared for by his devoted wife. When he was in his mid 30s he started to paint the sea and boats on the sea and then later he began the embroideries which he could do while lying in bed. I felt he was an artist in the truest sense and his art gave him a voice as it were, enabling him to find quiet and a certain wisdom in an otherwise impossible situation. The fact of there being so little known about him, made it into an interesting challenge; a biography without much biographical material. I realised I was free to allow my book to drift in any direction and so it became the story of the people I met or heard about as I was doing my rather haphazard researches and then bit by bit my own story became part of it as well, one of the many threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have written in a variety of formats. Which one do you feel most comfortable in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing for me has always been an exploration. I have done a wide range of subjects and formats but I think all my books have been a way of understanding myself through understanding other people and the predicaments they are faced with. I have never felt tied to a particular form and each new book has taken the shape that seemed to suit it best. With &lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; I enjoyed the fact that the pictures were made as important as the text; there are a lot of things that can be better said with images, rather than with words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have written about some fascinating people, many of whom had life changing experiences. Is there anyone you would still like to write about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that I have written about all sorts of very different people in very different situations – Napoleon dying on St Helena; Goya finding himself deaf; Billie Holiday trying to survive in the racist world of America in the 1940s and 50s… The list goes on, but I have no idea in advance of what other lives I might want to explore. In &lt;cite&gt;Threads&lt;/cite&gt; and in my previous book &lt;cite&gt;Thin Paths&lt;/cite&gt;, I really enjoyed talking to people and simply looking at the world around them and that fascination is part of what I am working on now. It will be a book without a main character, which is a new departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any news of &lt;cite&gt;Angels Dancing On A Pin&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Angels on a Pin&lt;/cite&gt; is half done, but I keep getting distracted by other plans, so I am not sure when it will be ready. I have written a poem for it which begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a writing woman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who uses words as best she can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To jump from fire to frying pan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From frying pan to pastures green&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With intermezzos in between&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chasing all the words that spin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like angels, dancing on a pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your perfect day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect day? Walking along the coast here, or in the mountains of Northern Italy where I still have a little house, with a good companion, not too much talk, a bit of sunshine and a few brief encounters with birds and animals, the landscape and the weather, alongside maybe one or two fellow human beings on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suffolk Libraries – an update on our budget for 2016/2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suffolk County Council approved their budget proposals at February’s full council meeting which included a reduction to the library service budget of £650,000 over two years. Suffolk Libraries Board have since agreed to the reduction of £350,000 for 2016/17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further savings needed to meet our new budget for 2016/17 should not have any significant impact on the frontline library service this year and Suffolk Libraries is committed to not closing any libraries during the life of the current contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still in discussions about the further saving for 2017/18 but will continue to work closely and positively with the county council throughout the year and will keep everyone informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have seen from last week’s national and regional media coverage, many libraries have closed across the country but the story in Suffolk is still a very positive one where all 44 libraries have remained open and with the support of our community groups, Suffolk Libraries has even been able to introduce new services and provides an increasingly diverse range of services and activities. For example – the Community Group in Beccles is funding an &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/news/beccles-library-to-increase-opening-hours-and-launch-new-reading-hack-project&quot;&gt;increase in opening hours&lt;/a&gt; at their library from April 2016 and the community groups at &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/news/kesgrave-library-refurbishment-and-temporary-closure&quot;&gt;Kesgrave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/news/glemsford-library-refurbishment-and-temporary-closure&quot;&gt;Glemsford&lt;/a&gt; are supporting refurbishment work at their libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always we are grateful to all our customers and community groups for their ongoing support of our library service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Felixstowe Library’s Golden Anniversary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This April marks 50 years since &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/branches/felixstowe-library&quot;&gt;Felixstowe Library&lt;/a&gt; opened for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library will be marking this milestone in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebrations will kick off with a visit from Felixstowe Community Choir on Saturday 23 April from 11am to 12noon. This is also the same day as World Book night. This very special one-off performance is a real treat as the choir are in great demand. On the day the library will also be decorated with memorabilia from 1966 with staff dressed in clothes from the 1960’s and music from the same era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a 1966 quiz running throughout the month. It costs £1 to enter and any money raised will help to support the library. The winners will be announced on 30 April and there are great prizes to be won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for a special exhibition about the history of the library and if you want to contribute there’s also a celebration box in the library for anyone to post their memories, photos or comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felixstowe Library is also hosting an afternoon with local crime author Alison Bruce on Saturday 30 April at 2pm with doors opening at 1.30pm. She will be talking about her Cambridge-based crime novels and will be signing copies of her books. Tickets are £5 and must be booked in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent comment from a customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Felixstowe Library is a fantastic asset to our local community. The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. The range of groups/activities for ALL ages and sections of the community is outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Meet the author: Emily Brightwell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Emily Brightwell is the author of the series of Victorian crime mysteries featuring the mild-mannered Inspector Witherspoon of Scotland Yard and, more importantly, his housekeeper Mrs Jeffries. A policeman’s widow herself, her quick wits allow her to nudge the Inspector in the right direction to solve the crime. Emily is currently writing number 35 of the Mrs Jeffries mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily started her writing career as a romance writer. She also wrote for Young Adults under her maiden name Cheryl Lanham. Emily’s books are a word of mouth hit in Suffolk libraries and have an avid following here and in several other countries including Japan. While writing her new book she took time out to answer some questions for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have fans of the Mrs Jeffries books all over the world. What is it about her that you think connects with so many people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like Mrs. Jeffries because she’s both kind and decent yet she doesn’t view humanity through rose-colored glasses. She’s aware of both the best and the worst of human nature. Additionally, she connects with people because of her commitment to justice and her willingness to step outside her role in society to do what she thinks is right. Plus, she fights for the underdog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who were your reading heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodness, there are so many! My biggest heroes are Earl Stanley Gardner and Raymond Chandler. There’s also Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Ellis Peters, Ruth Rendell, P D James, the great Swedish mystery writing team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. When I was growing up I was very much influenced by Noel Streatfield, Edward Eager and Nevil Shute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your type of writing is often described as ‘cosy’ crime. How do you feel about that label?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that label. A ‘cosy’ description and/or a ‘cosy’ cover is one of the tools a reader can use to see if she or he wants to read your book. I’m a great believer that people should read what they enjoy – and not what’s fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some readers don’t like mysteries with crude language, graphic violence or certain kinds of crimes – and I respect those tastes. Remember, just because it’s a cosy doesn’t mean it’s filled with sweetness and light – mine certainly aren’t. I’m a thematic writer and every book I write has an underlying social, political or spiritual statement that I think is important. It’s my pulpit!&lt;figure class=&quot;figure alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/featured-emily-brightwell-display-southwold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display of Emily Brightwell books at Southwold Library&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Display of Emily Brightwell books at Southwold Library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give us a sneak peek of what you are working on at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current project is Number 35 in the series – titled: &lt;cite&gt;Mrs. Jeffries Rights a Wrong&lt;/cite&gt; and the theme is that old sins cast long shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you hadn’t become a writer what career do you think you would have chosen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d have probably enjoyed being a physical anthropologist, a chef or a toxicologist. But nothing compares to being a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any plans for a TV adaptation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet. I’ve got fingers crossed that someone, somewhere (in Suffolk perhaps) will read one of the books and decide they would make a delightful TV series and contact my agent in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your perfect day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perfect day would be getting up early on Saturday morning to watch my beloved football team, Everton FC on TV – as this is a perfect day, they win. After that, I’d love to go to lunch at my favorite Japanese restaurant with family and friends. In the afternoon, I’d find a comfy chair, make a pot of PG Tips tea and settle in for a nice, long read of one of my favorite authors. A walk along the bay with my husband would be nice before dinner (I live in the San Francisco Bay area) and after a great meal, some entertainment on television before bed. As you can probably tell, I’m a homebody!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Sarah, our new mental health and wellbeing coordinator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Sarah and I’m the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/community-services/mental-health-information-services&quot;&gt;mental health and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; coordinator for Suffolk Libraries. Here is a little bit about me to introduce myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I’ve worked in an NHS Mental Health Trust, supporting and coordinating various projects around health and wellbeing, including service redesign, research, writing grant applications and evaluations. I also coordinated a Wellbeing programme called Bounce!, which sat within a Big Lottery Funded portfolio in the East of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bounce! provided wellbeing workshops and support to over 8,500 people across Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk and was designed to help people in learning about wellbeing, how wellbeing is different for each person and also to look at making small changes to improve their resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme worked with a wide range of community groups and organisations, as well as offering specific skill- building workshops to Looked After Children, Armed Forces Families and those who use foodbanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I developed a passion for working within the community and I especially enjoy working towards improving health and wellbeing. I love nothing more than working with people to problem solve in services, create new projects and engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time where health services are facing cuts and increasing pressure to deliver more, I believe the community is a great place to start when it comes to empowering and encouraging people to improve their wellbeing, become more resilient, and have the confidence and knowledge of where to go for help when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to be creative and in my spare time I can often be found surrounded by arts and crafts items, baking cakes or with my nose in a good book! Reading has always been a big part of my life – I usually have a few books on the go and I’m always adding to my ‘To read’ pile. Growing up I adored Roald Dahl (Especially &lt;cite&gt;George’s Marvellous Medicine&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Matilda&lt;/cite&gt;), R. L. Stine’s &lt;cite&gt;Goosebumps&lt;/cite&gt; and of course, the &lt;cite&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/cite&gt; series – which I still enjoy as an adult! These days I like to read as many different genres and authors as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thrilled to be a part of Suffolk Libraries and I hope to continue the excellent reputation the lovely David Grimmer built for this valuable service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t hesitate to contact me at sarah.lungley@suffolklibraries.co.uk if there is anything I can do to help or if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;
