&lt;p&gt;Springtime, and two misfits – one an eccentric loner and the other a one-eyed dog – forge an unlikely relationship. In a tired seaside town, these outcasts find solace in each other. But as their friendship grows, they are driven away by a community that perceives menace where there is only mishap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuri Herrera explores the crossings and translations people make in their minds and language as they move from one country to another, especially when there’s no going back. Traversing this lonely territory is Makina; leaving behind her life in Mexico to search for her brother, she is smuggled into the USA carrying a pair of secret messages – one from her mother and one from the Mexican underworld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the 1960s, the space race is underway and test pilot Jim Harrison and his colleagues are offered a place in history as the world’s first astronauts. But when his young family is thrown into crisis, Jim is faced with a decision that will affect the course of the rest of his life – whether to accept his ticket to the moon, and at what cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the girl who once dreamed of being a Charlie’s Angel become such a cowed and submissive woman? Marion’s life appears perfectly fine but she is controlled and bullied by her husband, her only respite a once a week trip to the local swimming pool. A chance meeting with an old school-friend develops into a secret relationship. She could leave her abusive and unfaithful husband. But is it too late?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan Stevenson was a young lawyer when he founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice dedicated to defending those most desperate and in need: the poor, the wrongly condemned, and women and children trapped in the farthest reaches of our criminal justice system. &lt;cite&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/cite&gt; is at once an unforgettable account of an idealistic, gifted young lawyer’s coming of age, a moving window into the lives of those he has defended, and an inspiring argument for compassion in the pursuit of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how one man’s act of mercy on a World War II battlefield changes the lives of six strangers across time and place, including a child on the brink of starvation, a blind museum curator looking for love, a German infantryman, and a humble caretaker at a retirement home in Santa Monica. These characters remain unaware of their connection until seemingly random acts of selflessness reveal the vital parts they play in each other’s lives. Inspired by true events.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-fallen-angels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fallen angels by Bob Dylan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15250463?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(203217)&amp;amp;QRYTEXT=Dylan%2C%20Bob%2C%201941-&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/fallen-angels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fallen angels by Bob Dylan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Dylan follows &lt;cite&gt;Shadows in the Night&lt;/cite&gt; with his 37th studio album. This one draws on the tunes of some of America’s greatest songwriters including Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn and Harold Arlen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth solo album from The Verve lead singer. &lt;cite&gt;These People&lt;/cite&gt; is the first new album in six years from the Brit and Ivor Novello award winning artist. It was produced by Ashcroft and marks a reunion with Wil Malone, who worked on the string arrangements on The Verve’s &lt;cite&gt;A Northern Soul&lt;/cite&gt; (1995), &lt;cite&gt;Urban Hymns&lt;/cite&gt; (1997), and the platinum-selling debut solo album &lt;cite&gt;Alone with Everybody&lt;/cite&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23rd solo album from Eric Clapton. This one features a combination of new material as well as cover versions of classic songs, contemporary tunes and influences Clapton has interpreted in his own style. It also features the track &lt;cite&gt;I will be there&lt;/cite&gt; featuring one “Angelo Mysterioso” who may or may not be George Harrison according to speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indie heroes return with the follow-up to their massive-selling debut, &lt;cite&gt;The Balcony&lt;/cite&gt;. They say their album consists of songs that were ‘made to play live’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second part of the two-part album based around collaborations with other electronic musicians from a wide range of decades and styles. This one features contributions from Pet Shop Boys, Primal Scream and Gary Numan amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always great to have new material from Beth Orton. Four years after her last album Beth returns with more trippy electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third album from CBR. This one “is about transformation and new life and confidence and joy” and finding beauty in life’s tragedies and triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Dr Feelgood founder Wilko Johnson was diagnosed with terminal cancer. With ten months to live, he decided to accept his imminent death and went on the road. He recorded Going Back Home with Roger Daltrey and prepared for the worst. Then the strangest thing happened: he didn’t die. ‘Don’t You Leave Me Here’ is the story of his life in music, his life with cancer, and his life now - in the future he never thought he would see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tudor monarchs were constantly surrounded by an army of attendants, courtiers and ministers. Even in their most private moments, they were accompanied by a servant specifically appointed for the task. A groom of the stool would stand patiently by as Henry VIII performed his daily purges, and when Elizabeth I retired for the evening, one of her female servants would sleep at the end of her bed. These attendants knew the truth behind the glamorous exterior and this book reveals the previously unexamined details about the characters we think we know so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book offers a first-hand, insider’s account of the life of a member of one of the most influential and widely-imitated band of all time, making this a fascinating fly-on-the-wall chronicle. Philip Norman has previously published definitive books on The Beatles and John Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even by the standards of a sport that requires enormous stamina and capacity for suffering, Jens Voigt is in a class on his own. Beloved by cycling fans for his madcap one-man breakaways as much as his sense of humour and quotable catchphrases, Jens is one of the most popular personalities in cycling. This book is a funny, insightful, and entertaining look at the tough realities of professional cycling, told in Jens’s trademark irreverent and inimitable style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Calman will be familiar to listeners of The News Quiz on Radio 4. You may not know that she also suffers from depression. Despite being one of the funniest women in the UK she has had her own black dog, the Crab of Hate , whispering in her ear since she can remember. And her answer? To talk about it. A woman who measures the length of her depression by box sets (‘Cracker’ good, ‘West Wing’ bad) and who has made therapy more of a hobby than a medical requirement, Susan has written the book on what’s it’s like to be gloomy and enjoy it. Certain that the world needs people with a more cynical outlook on life, the book is a celebration of what she, and if statistics are to be believed, one in four of us, go through daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of The Suspicions of Mr Whicher returns to Victorian crime. Early in the morning of Monday 8 July 1895, 13-year-old Robert Coombes and his 12-year-old brother Nattie set out from their small terraced house in East London to watch a cricket match at Lord’s. Their father had gone to sea the previous Friday, the boys told their neighbours, and their mother was visiting her family in Liverpool. Over the next ten days Robert and Nattie spent extravagantly, pawning their parents’ valuables to fund trips to the theatre and the seaside. But as the sun beat down on the Coombes house, a strange smell began to emanate from the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case for Detective Superintendent Roy Grace. We are already getting a waiting list for this one. An ugly duckling as a child, Jodie Bentley had two dreams in life - to be beautiful and rich. She’s achieved the first, with a little help from a plastic surgeon, and now she’s working hard on the second. Her philosophy on money is simple: you can either earn it or marry it. Marrying is easy, it’s getting rid of the husband afterwards that’s harder, that takes real skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopeless failed actor Berthold is exactly the same age as George Clooney (they share a birthday), but still lives with his mum. When he realises at her deathbed that he may lose his mother’s lovely council flat, built in the 1960s by celebrated architect Lubetkin, he adopts the old lady in the hospital bed next door and takes her home to impersonate his mum. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Constable Bob Skinner has seen a few crime scenes during his 30-year career. But few have affected him quite as much as the horrifying sight he finds in the back of a stolen car that collides with his own on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As his former colleagues investigate the mystery, Skinner is left to take on the unusual challenge of tracing a million-pound yacht, vanished from its mooring. And yet, as the body count rises, a link surfaces that could provide the key to both. And as discord spreads within the newly unified Police Scotland, it will soon become clear whether Skinner is on the side of the angels - or working against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video-clip is sent to the National Criminal Investigation Department. Someone has secretly filmed a woman through her window from the garden. The next day she is found dead after a frenzied knife-attack. The police receive a second film of another unknown woman. There is no way of identifying her before time runs out. This is the latest from the Swedish husband and wife writing team Alexander Ahndoril and Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988, two girls with identical names and the same love of ballet meet for the first time. They seem destined to be best friends forever and to become professional dancers. Years later, however, they have both been dealt so many cruel and unexpected blows that they walk away from each other into very different futures - one enters a convent, the other becomes a minor celebrity. Will these new, ‘invisible’ lives be the ones they were meant to live, or will they only find that kind of salvation when they are reunited 20 years later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in 2029. Darkly funny and unsettling novel with some outcomes that can almost be seen now. The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their 97-year-old patriarch dies. Yet America’s soaring national debt has grown so enormous that it can never be repaid. Under siege on the currency markets, the dollar is in meltdown. A bloodless world war will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Their inheritance turned to dust, each family member must contend with disappointment, and as the effects of the downturn start to hit, the challenge of survival. Recently wealthy Avery is petulant that she can’t buy olive oil, while her sister Florence is forced to absorb strays into her cramped household. As their father Carter fumes at having to care for his stepmother now that a nursing home is too expensive, his sister Nollie, an expat author, returns from abroad to a country that’s unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, one that has been on most people’s must read lists for 2016, The latest Rose Tremain. It is the tutor who tells the young Gustav that he must try to be more like a coconut - that he needs a hard shell to protect the softness inside. This is what his native Switzerland has perfected - a shell to protect its neutrality, to keep its people safe. But his beloved friend, Anton, doesn’t want to be safe - a gifted pianist, he longs to make his mark on the world outside. On holiday one summer in Davos, the boys stumble across a remote building. Long ago, it was a TB sanitorium; now it is wrecked and derelict. Here, they play a game of life and death, deciding which of their imaginary patients must burn. It becomes their secret. ‘The Gustav Sonata’ begins in the 1930s, under the shadow of the Second World War, and follows the boys into maturity, and middle age, where their friendship is tested as never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast paced, high quality space opera. Thorvald Spear’s only goal is to get his revenge on the rogue artificial intelligence, Penny Royal. The AI apparently left him to die and killed thousands of his comrades in the process. But things aren’t as clear-cut as they seem. Can he truly rely on his own version of events? And has Penny Royal been meddling with his memories and his very identity?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mrs Hemingway by Naomi Wood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-mrs-hemingway.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mrs Hemingway by Naomi Wood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an intriguing novel centred on the four marriages of American author Ernest Hemingway. It’s an intense portrait of their lives together and an eloquent window into their world rather than a polemic: The reader may become frustrated and unsympathetic with their often heartless and selfish behaviour but in the end it’s a keen and honest observation of love, loneliness and obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the afterword, Mrs Hemingway is a work of fiction, but the prose is so good and the characters so vivid that it becomes as believable as a work of non-fiction. Largely structured around the beginning and end of each relationship, the novels first chapters are set in Antibes with Hemingway, his first wife Hadley and mistress Fife on holiday together. It’s a very clever and surprisingly enjoyable read and by the end it is very hard not be moved and hungry to learn more about these larger than life characters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead by Tom Stoppard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead by Tom Stoppard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off.” Tom Stoppard’s most famous play is exactly that; following two minor characters from &lt;cite&gt;Hamlet&lt;/cite&gt;, Stoppard’s 1966 play could be described as a behind-the-scenes peek at the most dodgy Danish court in literature. But that would only scratch the metaphorical surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern suffer from a common post-modern literary condition; the unsettling suspicion that they are both actually fictional. With only small appearances in Shakespeare’s play, in Stoppard’s version, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find themselves at a loose end for much of the time, left to hang around with little idea of what exactly is going on. As a great comedy writer, Stoppard manages this plot – or lack of it – with finesse. Whereas Shakespeare creates an obsequious, unlikeable pair, you can’t help but feel for Stoppard’s reluctant protagonists, who worry about how to engage the ‘stark raving sane’ Hamlet in conversation, who are bemused by the continuous exits and entrances of the rest of the cast, and who are, in the end, simply trying to follow bewildering instructions from on high as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a novel, but it’s still a page-turner, as you follow Ros and Guil through the mires of fictional existential crisis to their untimely end (which, considering the title, shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.) In Shakespeare’s entirely different play, Hamlet agonises famously over ‘to be or not to be’; in Stoppard’s quirky, undefinable masterpiece, Rosencrantz advises, “I wouldn’t think about it, if I were you. You’d only get depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6309508?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(376656)&amp;amp;QRYTEXT=Rosencrantz%20and%20Guildenstern%20are%20Dead&quot;&gt;Order &lt;cite&gt;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead&lt;/cite&gt; from our catalogue →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suffolk Libraries launches new scheme to support young people’s mental health</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is getting behind a national scheme to support young people with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Reading Well for young people’ is a new scheme which provides expert information and a recommended reading list to help tackle some of the mental health and wellbeing issues that young people face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is being launched today (12 April) and is part of the hugely successful Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme which is already available through the library service. Reading Well for young people is aimed at 13-18 year-olds and provides high-quality information, support and advice on a wide-range of issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and self-harm, and difficult life pressures, like bullying and exams. The number of 15-16 year olds experiencing anxiety or depression has doubled in the last 30 years and 1 in 10 young people have a diagnosable mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme has been developed with the help of a panel of young people who have had experience of mental health issues. The books can be recommended by GPs, school nurses, counsellors and other health professionals as well as being free to borrow from the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is delivered by The Reading Agency in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians and the Association of Senior Children’s and Education Librarians. It is funded by Arts Council England and the Wellcome Trust and is supported by a range of health organisations including NHS England (IAPT), Public Health England, Mental Health Foundation, Mind and YoungMinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries already supports the Books on Prescription programme and is unique in having a dedicated Mental Health and Wellbeing Co-ordinator who works to ensure library visitors can get access to the health and wellbeing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries and a member of the Society of Chief Librarians, said: “I am very pleased that Suffolk Libraries will be supporting this very positive new programme. We know that young people may face many challenges and issues and may not always know where to turn for help. Libraries can play a key role in providing access to reading materials and information which can make a real difference to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffolk Libraries is also hosting an event aimed at helping schools to promote reading as a way of tackling mental health or crisis in young people. ‘Building Wellness through Reading’ takes place at the IP-City centre in Ipswich on Friday 27 May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: “Libraries can play a significant role in the health of local communities by providing free access to advice and information for people of all ages. This important new scheme uses libraries, books and reading to reach out to young people to help them manage their mental health and wellbeing, and cope with the pressures of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Well for young people’s recommended reading list of 35 books were selected by mental health experts and young people. The list includes a wide range of self-help and information titles, as well as fiction, including hugely influential novels such as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information on the new scheme at &lt;a href=&quot;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&quot;&gt;http://reading-well.org.uk/blog/launch-of-reading-well-for-young-people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public libraries have offered support to adults with common mental health needs since 2013 through Reading Well Books on Prescription. The Reading Well for young people list of 35 recommended books will soon be available from all library services along with supporting leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates of mental health problems increase as young people reach adolescence. Poor mental health for young people has serious implications for later life, affecting wellbeing and the ability to work and earn as adults. The core booklist for Reading Well for young people is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The magic finger by Roald Dahl</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/featured-the-magic-finger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The magic finger by Roald Dahl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strange and short little morality tale for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows an eight-year-old girl and the Gregg family on the farm next door. Mr Gregg and his sons love to hunt with guns. This infuriates the girl. Her rage causes her to put the ‘Magic Finger’ on them. She loses control and curses people with a bolt of magic that shoots from her finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her frustration grew when the Greggs refused to listen to her pleas to cease hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, they awake to find they’ve shrunk to the size of birds and have ducks’ wings in place of arms. Furthermore, a family of ducks has grown man-sized and have human arms in place of wings and they take over the Greggs’ home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will the Greggs fare when forced to build a nest and find food?! Or when the ducks shoot at them?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message of the book is anti-blood sports and about not acting without thinking. The girl regrets her past actions regarding her gift, but as the story progresses we see her learn to gain control. This is Roald Dahl at his creative, zany best, teaching children to use what upsets them to engage their imagination before acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tale demonstrates the need for empathy. The Greggs learn, not only how the ducks feel at being shot at, but also what their lives entail daily, trying to survive. It teaches children to fully consider others before acting carelessly or cruelly against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little book has the perfect blend of humour, imagination, and moral guidance. It is also short and fairly easy to read which can offer reluctant or struggling young readers plenty of confidence when they can finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

As part of my role I have responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/hub&quot;&gt;Enterprise and Innovation Hub&lt;/a&gt; located on the top floor of the library, which is where our weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeclub.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Code Club&lt;/a&gt; is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Code Club a while ago while carrying out a volunteer role I have outside of the library. The concept interested me, but at that point I wasn’t in a position to be able to move forward. When I started at Ipswich County Library in August 2015 I was quite keen to investigate the idea of a Code Club further. By coincidence a volunteer came in to ask if we could start a Code Club in the library. I didn’t need asking twice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up our Code Club with a combination of volunteers; Code Club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stemnet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;STEMnet&lt;/a&gt; and high school students. I started off with one volunteer who was very proactive getting other volunteers on board — she continues to be extremely helpful and is an active volunteer at the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/article/eadt-first-library-code-club-a-big-success.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Newspaper cutting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Code Club was featured in the local paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each session we generally have 2 Code Club/STEM volunteers and a couple of High School students. The High School students focus on troubleshooting IT and this allows the Code Club/STEM volunteers to interact with the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group started off at 8 children, after the first group of sessions this was increased to 14. The children range in age from 6-11, the youngest children generally have their parents helping them with the material and the group work well together. We don’t have a rigid structure where the children work systematically through the projects. Instead the children choose their own projects to suit their interest and ability working at their own level — if they choose one that is too hard or too easy they soon change it for another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coding in the hub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest challenge for our Code Club is also our greatest triumph. The club has been more popular than I imagined. The waiting list continues to grow faster than we can create spaces in our club! I’m now considering starting a second Code Club. I’ve approached a local college who have Level 3 Game Design and IT students to see any of them would like to gain some valuable work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to anyone else working in a library and considering starting a Code Club would be: Go for it, what have you got to lose? It’s a really great experience to see the children engaged and learning at a Club they have chosen to come to.&lt;/p&gt;
