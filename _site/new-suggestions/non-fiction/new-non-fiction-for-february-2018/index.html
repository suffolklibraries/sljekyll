<h2 id="old-too-soon-smart-too-late-my-story-by-kieron-dyer--oliver-holt"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2316106"><cite>Old Too Soon, Smart Too Late: my story</cite>, by Kieron Dyer &amp; Oliver Holt</a></h2>

<p>Tell-all autobiography of the former Ipswich Town and England star.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the public mind, Kieron Dyer came to symbolise so much of what was self-destructive about a group of football players known collectively as the ‘Baby Bentley generation’. Nicknamed ‘The King of Bling’ by the tabloid press, Dyer was caught up in many of the scandals that characterised the history of a talented crop of players who promised so much and delivered so little, a generation whose wages and lavish lifestyles began to alienate them from the fans who once worshipped them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The brash young man is gone now, and in his place is the quiet, caring, wise man who was such a favourite on <cite>I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!</cite> in 2015. Dyer narrates, in uncompromising detail, how a generation of talented English footballers, taken out of working class childhoods and presented with a world of glitz, glamour, wealth and temptation, failed to cope with the riches that were presented to them and often fell apart.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="somebody-i-used-to-know-by-wendy-mitchell--anna-wharton"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317583"><cite>Somebody I Used to Know</cite>, by Wendy Mitchell &amp; Anna Wharton</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Wendy Mitchell was diagnosed with dementia at the age of 58, she had to say goodbye to the woman she once was. Her career in the NHS, her ability to drive, cook and run - the various shades of her independence - were suddenly gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yet Wendy was determined not to give in. She was, and still is, propelled by a need to live in the moment, never knowing which version of herself might surface tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this phenomenal memoir, Wendy grapples with questions most of us have never had to consider. What do you value when loss of memory reframes what you have, how you have lived and what you stand to lose? What happens when you can no longer recognise your own daughters, or even, on the foggiest of days, yourself?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This memoir, published in English for the first time, is remarkable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pavlichenko was World War II’s best-scoring sniper and had a varied wartime career that included trips to England and America. In June 1941, when Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, she left her university studies, ignored the offer of a position as a nurse, to become one of Soviet Russia’s 2000 female snipers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Less than a year later she had 309 recorded kills, including 29 enemy sniper kills. She was withdrawn from active duty after being injured: she was also regarded as a key heroic figure for the war effort. She spoke at rallies in Canada and the US and the folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote a song, <cite>Killed By A Gun</cite> about her exploits.”</p>

<p>On 6 February, it will be 100 years since some British women were finally granted the vote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the voices of key suffragettes, <cite>Rise Up Women!</cite> chronicles the founding of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies in the 1860s, led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and the formation of the more militant Women’s Social and Political Union in 1903. ‘Deeds not words!’ was their slogan - and they took increasingly violent action, enduring police brutality, imprisonment and force-feeding.”</p>

<p>The follow-up to 2016 bestseller <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2073265"><cite>Davina’s Sugar-free in a Hurry</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Being a mum is a non-stop juggling act and there’s always a million-and-one things to do to keep everyone safe, happy and healthy. We know that to keep our busy bodies energized we should be watching our blood sugar and eating smart, but it’s not always easy to plan ahead or spend time in the kitchen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Davina’s Sugar-Free Family Cookbook</cite> is packed with tasty refined sugar-free recipes that get great meals on the table - fast. No fuss, no tricky-to-find ingredients, just amazing, healthy food fit for busy family life.”</p>

<h2 id="withdrawn-traces-searching-for-the-truth-about-richey-manic-by-leon-noakes--sara-hawys-roberts"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2322034"><cite>Withdrawn Traces: searching for the truth about Richey Manic</cite>, by Leon Noakes &amp; Sara Hawys Roberts</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From despair, to where?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On 1 February 1995, Richey Edwards, guitarist of the Manic Street Preachers, went missing at the age of 27. On the eve of a promotional trip to America, he vanished from his London hotel room, his car later discovered near the Severn Bridge, a notorious suicide spot.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Over two decades later, Richey’s disappearance remains one of the most moving, mysterious and unresolved episodes in recent pop culture history. For those with a basic grasp of the facts, Richey’s suicide seems obvious and undeniable. However, a closer investigation of his actions in the weeks and months before his disappearance just don’t add up, and until now few have dared to ask the important questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This title is written with the co-operation of the Edwards family, testimony from Richey’s closest friends and unprecedented and exclusive access to Richey’s personal archive.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Author Michael Rouse guides us around Felixstowe’s streets and buildings, showing how its well-known landmarks used to look and how they have changed over the years as well as exploring its lesser-known sights and hidden corners. With the help of a handy location map, readers are invited to follow a timeline of events and discover for themselves the changing face of the town.”</p>
