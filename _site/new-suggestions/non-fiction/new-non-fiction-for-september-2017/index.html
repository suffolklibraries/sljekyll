<blockquote>
  <p>“In this warm and engaging book, the late, great Sir Roger Moore reflects on life and aging. Delivered, along with his own hand-drawn sketches, to his publisher mere days before he passed away, in this book, Roger looks back on his life - and gives it his trademark sideways glance, too.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renowned as a much-loved and highly respected BBC journalist, Victoria Derbyshire has spent 20 years finding the human story behind the headlines. In 2015 she found herself at the heart of the news, with a devastating breast cancer diagnosis. With honesty and openness, she decided to live out her treatment and recovery in the spotlight in a series of video diaries that encouraged thousands to seek diagnosis and help.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Victoria has kept a diary since she was nine years old and in <cite>Dear Cancer, Love Victoria</cite> she shares her day to day experiences of life following her diagnosis and coming to terms with a future that wasn’t planned.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="zoo-quest-the-adventures-of-a-young-naturalist-by-david-attenborough"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2197963"><cite>Zoo Quest: the adventures of a young naturalist</cite>, by David Attenborough</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In 1954, a young television presenter was offered the opportunity of a lifetime - to travel the world finding rare and elusive animals for London Zoo’s collection, and to film the expeditions for the BBC. His name was David Attenborough, and the programme, <cite>Zoo Quest</cite>, not only heralded the start of a remarkable career in broadcasting, but changed the way we viewed the natural world forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Written with his trademark wit and charm, this is not just the story of a remarkable adventure, but of the man who made us fall in love with the natural world, and who is still doing so today.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-life-of-my-own-by-claire-tomalin"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2197076"><cite>A Life of My Own</cite>, by Claire Tomalin</a></h2>

<p>Anyone who reads biographies will be aware of Claire Tomalin’s work. Now the time has come for her to write her own story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this intimate and insightful memoir, Claire remembers moments of national literary history as well as intense personal emotion: a turbulent childhood disturbed by her parents’ custody battle; her escape to Cambridge University, where she met her husband, the journalist Nick Tomalin; life on Gloucester Crescent with neighbours Alan Bennett and Mary-Kay Wilmers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Personally, tragedy struck when her husband was killed while reporting in Israel; professionally, Claire’s career soared as she became literary editor of the <cite>New Statesman</cite> and <cite>Sunday Times</cite>, working with Christopher Hitchens and Julian Barnes, before discovering her vocation as a biographer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An affair with a younger writer brought fleeting joy; the suicide of daughter brought infinite pain. Now married to playwright Michael Frayn, Claire reflects on an extraordinary life filled with love, loss and literature.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="sweet-by-yotam-ottolenghi--helen-goh"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2205692"><cite>Sweet</cite>, by Yotam Ottolenghi &amp; Helen Goh</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In his stunning new baking and desserts cookbook Yotam Ottolenghi and his long-time collaborator Helen Goh bring the Ottolenghi hallmarks of fresh, evocative ingredients, exotic spices and complex flavourings - including fig, rose petal, saffron, aniseed, orange blossom, pistachio and cardamom - to indulgent cakes, biscuits, tarts, puddings, cheesecakes and ice cream.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great recipes and mouthwatering photography add up to another must have cookery book from Yotam Ottolenghi. This is likely to be on the cookery book ‘best of’ lists at the end of the year.</p>

<h2 id="a-farmer-and-his-dog-by-adam-henson"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2196722"><cite>A Farmer and his Dog</cite>, by Adam Henson</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In <cite>A Farmer and His Dog</cite>, Adam Henson explores the unique relationship between a farmer and his most loyal friend. Sheepdogs come in a variety of shapes and sizes from border collies to Australian kelpies (rumoured to be a distant relative of the dingo). Not only are they essential to the running of a farm, but they are fiercely intelligent and loyal family companions. But how have sheepdogs evolved across the centuries? What are the characteristics that make a border collie a premier herding dog?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As well as the histories of the various breeds and memories of the special dogs Adam has had over the years, this book is peppered with extraordinary stories of the brave acts of heroic sheepdogs - from protecting a rare breed of miniature penguins in Australia, to the pensioner farmer whose life was saved by his loyal sheepdog.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="head-gardeners-by-ambra-edwards--charlie-hopkinson"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2242217"><cite>Head Gardeners</cite>, by Ambra Edwards &amp; Charlie Hopkinson</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What is Britain’s greatest contribution to world culture? Ambra Edwards suggests it is the garden. It is an art form we have made peculiarly our own, and which we have been exporting to the rest of the world for the last three centuries. It is also an important economic contributor. Sixty per cent of National Trust members say they join up first and foremost to enjoy the gardens, while Britain’s gardens bring in visitors from all over the world. Gardens are hugely important to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yet by their very nature they are mutable. What makes them (and keeps them) special is the input of the people who look after them. These are the head gardeners. This book explores the lives, vision and achievements of 14 very special head gardeners, and examines the many and various roles of the head gardener today.”</p>
