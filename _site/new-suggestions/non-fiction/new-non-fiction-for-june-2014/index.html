<p>Lynn Barber, by her own admission, has always suffered from a compelling sense of nosiness. An exceptionally inquisitive child she constantly questioned everyone she knew about imitate details of their lives.</p>

<p>This talent for nosiness, coupled with her unusual lack of the very English fear of social embarrassment, is the perfect blend for a celebrity interviewer.</p>

<p>Barber takes us through her early career at Penthouse where she started out interviewing foot fetishists, voyeurs, dominatrices and men who liked wearing nappies, through her later more eminent career at the Telegraph, Sunday Express, Vanity Fair, Observer and Sunday Times</p>

<p>There is nothing quite like the smell of a scrumptious steak and ale pie cooking in the oven.</p>

<p>There perhaps isn’t anything better than the first taste of a caramel and coffee éclair.</p>

<p>From Britain’s favourite expert baker comes a mouth-watering new book about two of our nation’s obsessions: pies and puddings.</p>

<p><cite>Paul Hollywood’s Pies and Puds</cite> is simply a must-have. Whether you’re a sweet or a savoury person, a keen novice or an expert baker: it’s time to get baking pies and puds.</p>

<p>“The real war started for me today”. So begins the diary of 18-year-old Mary Mulry, a young Irish nurse, newly arrived in London in 1940.</p>

<p>Over the next 7 years she witnesses many of the pivotal events of the war at first hand. In London during the Blitz she sees a young woman die after a botched abortion, narrowly escapes from the bombing of the Alexandra Hotel and nurses critically ill children during bombing raids in Woolwich.</p>

<p>In Normandy in 1944, arriving on the heels of the D-Day invasion, she nurses Allied soldiers and German prisoners of war. In war-torn Belgium, she records harrowing stories of casualties from the Battle of Arnhem.</p>

<p>In these extraordinary diaries we see a young woman coming of age, falling in and out of love several times over.</p>

<p>Have you resolved to give up sugar this year? As more and more people sign up to the ‘no sugar’ club, Nicole Mowbray looks at the hard-boiled facts about giving up the sweet stuff and explains what it’s like to ditch it – for good.</p>

<p>A collection of delightfully witty stories by actress, comedy writer and columnist Rebecca Front.</p>

<p>Rebecca has always used anecdotes from her own life to inform not only the characters she plays in such series as ‘<cite>he Thick of It</cite> and <cite>Nighty Night</cite>, but also her frequent observational comment pieces for the <cite>The Guardian</cite>, <cite>The Independent</cite> and other magazines.</p>

<p>In <cite>Curious</cite>, she takes those characters further, exploring and delighting in the absurdities of life and the oddities of human nature.</p>

<p>From a German POW camp to HM Forces’ only remaining detention centre, the mere mention of ‘Colly’ struck fear into the hearts of thousands of servicemen over the years.</p>

<p>But what was it really like behind the forbidding barbed wire in those ancient Nissen huts? How much has it changed since 1947?</p>

<p>Written in the words of those who were there, from the 1940s through to the present day, commandants, members of staff, detainees, military escorts, padres and visitors have shared their own experiences to create a unique history that sheds light on an almost unknown area of military life.</p>

<p>In 1938 Johnny Sherwood was a young professional footballer on the brink of an England career, touring the world with the all-star British team the Islington Corinthians.</p>

<p>By 1942 he was a soldier surrendering to the Japanese at the siege of Singapore. Taken prisoner he was sent to a POW camp deep in the heart of the Thai jungle, where he was starved, beaten, and forced to build the notorious ‘railway of death’ on the River Kwai.</p>

<p>Johnny kept his and his men’s spirits up with tales of his footballing past, even organising matches until he and the other prisoners became too weak to play.</p>
