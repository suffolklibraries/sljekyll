<h2 id="maddie8217s-review">Maddie’s review</h2>

<p>While there’s an abundance of fiction about the harrowing effects of warfare on servicemen, little of it approaches the effects war wreaks on women. With women a vital part of today’s military services and many deployed on the front line, a novel that addressed warfare from a woman’s perspective was long overdue. This is where Liz Trenow’s <cite>The Poppy Factory</cite> takes up the baton.</p>

<h3 id="the-plot">The plot</h3>

<p><cite>The Poppy Factory</cite> concerns itself with two women from different generations, united in their struggle readjusting to normal life in the wake of war. In the present day, Jess has just been discharged from her final tour of Afghanistan as a paramedic, and in 1918 her great-grandmother, Rose, is faced with return of her husband from the western-front of World War I.</p>

<p>Jess’ return from the front is the focus of the narrative. However, her arrival back does not signal a new beginning from her past since she is plagued with memories of bloodshed and violence. Jess alienates her loved ones after becoming increasingly dependent on alcohol to block the memories out.</p>

<p>Her great-grandmother Rose, on the other hand, is the loved one, waiting for her husband Alfie to return from the western-front. But when Alfie does return, he is paralysed by warfare on not only a mental level but a physical one – having his leg amputated after a mine explosion.</p>

<p>Despite the two women having different involvements in warfare, it is the parallels between them that Trenow best conveys. While the story is set in the present day, by having Rose’s experiences recalled from her diary entries, Trenow is able to establish Rose as a character, rather than just a memory. The diary form allows for the past to be heard through an authentic voice, and gives <cite>The Poppy Factory</cite> a sense of realism.</p>

<h3 id="the-horrors-of-war">The horrors of war</h3>

<p>I did feel that at times the horrors of warfare were glossed over for trivial conversations that deviated from this topic. We learn that Jess and her great-grandfather Alfie suffer with memories of the terrible violence they witnessed on the front line, but little is actually described of these events. As a piece of war-fiction I would have liked more descriptive passages that emphasised the horrors witnessed, as I think this would have increased the shock and sympathy I had for the characters.</p>

<h3 id="the-poppy-factory-charity">The Poppy Factory charity</h3>

<p>What I liked most however was Trenow’s decision to use the work of the charity, The Poppy Factory in Richmond, in her plot. The Poppy Factory was set up in 1922 to initially produce the poppies that were created as a symbol of remembrance, but later worked to rehabilitate disabled servicemen and find them employment. The factory features in both Jess and Rose’s stories as a centre where those affected by warfare are offered the support needed to reconcile their lives. I really appreciated hearing more about The Poppy Factory and their work, and felt that it further aided the book’s realism.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Published in the year of World War I’s centenary, <cite>The Poppy Factory</cite> is a topical book that will spark interest with those who are interested in World War I and/or modern day conflicts. While nothing innovative was really revealed about the effects of war, the book’s female perspective does go towards making <cite>The Poppy Factory</cite> nuanced from other pieces of war-fiction. What Trenow makes emphatically clear is that suffering can hit those not only engaged in warfare, but those left behind.</p>
