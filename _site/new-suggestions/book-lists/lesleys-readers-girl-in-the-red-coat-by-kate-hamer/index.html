<p>Having to acknowledge the abduction of your child will remain for most parents no more than a latent fear, but it also a fear that threatens to be catastrophic if it is awakened. This is the premise to Kate Hamer’s debut novel, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite>, which tells the chilling story of the abduction of 8 year old Carmel Wakeford and the suffering her mother, Beth, endures in the wake of her disappearance.</p>

<p>Set in rural Norfolk, Carmel and Beth lead a stable family life, despite Beth being separated from Carmel’s father, Paul. Carmel is acknowledged by those who surround her as a daydreamer and a maverick; she sparks attention with family friends and her teachers as a girl who holds an air of mystery and is indisputably clever for her age.</p>

<p>Hamer creates with Carmel a hauntingly real depiction of a child tentatively approaching her teenage years – she is endearing in her naïve apprehension of the world around her, yet also keen to learn upon her experiences to build a better picture of what she can ascertain as fact.</p>

<p>It is the naivety and innocence of Carmel that lends itself towards her abduction. In a single moment of distraction Carmel is separated from her mother at a village festival and the two are unable to find one another.</p>

<p>Enter a mysterious man who spots Carmel and presents himself to her as her long-lost grandfather. The man tells Carmel they must leave the fair together, and trusting Carmel departs with him obediently. Her abduction now sets the stage for a spiralling series of thrilling, perverse and haunting events over the next five years.</p>

<p>It is a fantastic decision by Hamer to have the story oscillate between Carmel and Beth’s point of view. I felt this style of narration really brought the novel to life, as it creates an immersive experience in which the reader can understand the abduction from two very contrasting perspectives.</p>

<p>It becomes clear that while Carmel grows in her experiences during her abduction, Beth regresses, continuing each day further into a state of depression.</p>

<p>Framing her novel over the series of days Carmel has been missing for made me think of other bestselling crime-fiction such as Gillian Flynn’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13075262?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(185983)&amp;QRYTEXT=Gone%20girl">Gone Girl</a></cite>, where in both cases the ‘days missing’ format reiterates the passing of time and creates an increasing sense of desperation.</p>

<p>I was also reminded of the fantastic Ian McEwan whose novel <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13074538?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(559738)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20child%20in%20time">The Child in Time</a></cite> is also based around a parent’s coming-to-terms with the abduction of their child. For those who like crime fiction, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite> is not one that should be missed on any count.</p>

<p>My only slight criticism would be the book’s ending, which I felt was resolved too quickly for what its long series of events really needed. After being confronted with a dazzling mystery I was ready for a thorough unravelling to greet me at the novel’s end, but this was all tied off too quickly and neatly for my liking.</p>

<p>That aside, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite> is a beautifully written story that conveys the people and situations at the heart of a terrible event with sensitivity and realism. With a heaping of mystery, crime and drama this is an exciting debut novel by the newest writer to join the prestigious line of Faber &amp; Faber authors. I’m eagerly anticipating the next novel from Kate Hamer!</p>

<h2 id="lesley-dolphin8217s-review">Lesley Dolphin’s review:</h2>

<p>A gripping read. This is cleverly told — the story alternates between the mum and the daughter and it’s told by them so we feel the absolute desperation of a mother who’s child is lost and the confusion of the little girl who’s taken. I couldn’t put it down — everything had to wait until I’d got to the end to see if it has a happy ending. Obviously I’m not going to tell you, but it’s left me wanting to know more, which means everyone will be talking about <cite>The Girl In The Red Coat</cite>!</p>
