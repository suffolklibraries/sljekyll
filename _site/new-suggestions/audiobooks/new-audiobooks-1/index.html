<blockquote>
  <p>“Reeling from a brutal attack that leaves her flatmate dead and her badly injured, Lisa Fulbrook flees to the countryside to recuperate. With only vague memories of the event, she isolates herself from her friends and family, content to spend her days wandering the hills with her dog, Riley. However, Lisa is soon plagued, not only by vivid flashbacks, but questions, too: how did their assailant know them? Why were they attacked? And what really happened that night?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As she desperately tries to piece together the memories, Lisa realises that there’s another truth still hidden to her, a truth she can’t escape from. A truth that may have been right in front of her all along.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Will she ever be anything more than an East End girl?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cissy Farmer longs to escape her life in London’s Docklands where times are hard and money is tight. And when she meets the debonair Langley Makepeace, her dream seems within reach. But the price of belonging in Langley’s brittle, sophisticated world could be much higher than Cissy ever imagined. And torn between Langley and her gentle childhood sweetheart, Eddie Bennet, she is forced to gamble on her future chance of happiness, a decision that will change her life forever.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freya is a genealogist, but has never paid as much attention to her own family. When her marriage starts to collapse and her grown-up daughters seem more distant than ever, Freya’s reckless abandon startles everyone, and long-hidden secrets begin to emerge.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The lost city has defined Nina Wilde’s life. Her parents’ obsession with Atlantis cost them their lives, but finding it brought Nina to her husband Eddie Chase and a series of archaeological treasures.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A decade later, the International Heritage Agency needs their help to locate the Secret Codex, an account of ancient Atlantean explorer Talonor’s journeys, thought to be located in the dangerous underwater ruins of Atlantis. Unable to resist one more adventure, the couple join the mission.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when a long-lost relative reappears in Nina’s life, asking her to use the Codex to find a hidden cave containing the secret of King Midas, she is unprepared for the devastation that follows. The promise of unlimited gold has aroused the greed of powerful and ruthless forces - and only Nina and Eddie stand in their way.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As a forensic psychiatrist at New York’s leading institution of its kind, Dr. Lily Dominick has evaluated the mental states of some of the country’s most dangerous psychotics. But the strangely compelling client she interviewed today - a man with no name, accused of the most twisted crime - struck her as somehow different from the others, despite the two impossible claims he made.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“According to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday in fact. Just after <cite>Any Answers</cite> on Radio 4….</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Events have been set in motion to bring about the End of Days. The armies of Good and Evil are gathering and making their way towards the sleepy English village of Lower Tadfield. The Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse - War, Famine, Pollution and Death - are assembling.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Witchfinder Shadwell and his assistant Newton Pulsifier are also en route to Tadfield to investigate unusual phenomena in the area, while Anathema Device, descendent of prophetess Agnes Nutter, tries to decipher her ancestor’s cryptic predictions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Atlantis is rising; fish are falling from the sky; everything seems to be going to the Divine Plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everything, that is, but for an unlikely angel and demon duo, who have been living on Earth for several millennia and have become rather fond of the place. If they are to prevent Armageddon they’ve got to find and kill the one who will bring it about: the Antichrist himself. There’s just one small problem: someone seems to have mislaid him…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ember Hill left the dragon organization Talon to take her chances with rebel dragon Cobalt and his crew of rogues. But Ember can’t forget the sacrifice made for her by the human boy who could have killed her — Garret Xavier Sebastian, a soldier of the dragon-slaying Order of St. George, the boy who saved her from a Talon assassin, knowing that by doing so, he’d signed his own death warrant.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Determined to save Garret from execution, Ember must convince Cobalt to help her break into the Order’s headquarters. With assassins after them and Ember’s own brother helping Talon with the hunt, the rogues find an unexpected ally in Garret and a new perspective on the underground battle between Talon and St. George.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A reckoning is brewing and the secrets hidden by both sides are shocking and deadly. Soon Ember must decide: Should she retreat to fight another day … or start an all-out war?”</p>

<h3 id="lincoln-in-the-bardo-by-george-saunders-read-by-various"><a href="https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_434026&amp;fromPage=1&amp;b2bSite=4172"><cite>Lincoln in the Bardo</cite>, by George Saunders, read by various</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realise it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved 11-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. ‘My poor boy, he was too good for this earth’, the president says at the time. God has called him home. Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic historical framework into a thrilling supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo, a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why would you run scared from a happy home?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re waiting for your beloved husband to get home from work. You’re making dinner, looking forward to hearing about his day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s the last thing you remember.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You wake up in hospital, with no idea how you got there. They tell you that you were in an accident; you lost control of your car whilst driving in a dangerous part of town.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The police suspect you were up to no good. But your husband refuses to believe it. Your best friend isn’t so sure. And even you don’t know what to believe…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s the summer of 1954, and the residents of Cottonwood, California, are dying. At the center of it all is six-year-old Danny McCray, a strange and silent child the townspeople regard with fear and superstition, and who appears to bring illness and ruin to those around him. Even his own mother is plagued by a disease that is slowly consuming her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sheriff Jim Kent, increasingly aware of the whispers and rumors surrounding the boy, has watched the people of his town suffer — and he worries someone might take drastic action to protect their loved ones. Then a stranger arrives, and Danny and his ten-year-old brother, Sean, go missing. In the search that follows, everyone is a suspect, and the consequences of finding the two brothers may be worse than not finding them at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
