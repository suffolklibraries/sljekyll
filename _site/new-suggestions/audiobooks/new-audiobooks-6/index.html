  <p>“A shocking mass murder occurs at a wedding in a small Dales church and a huge manhunt follows. Eventually, the shooter is run to ground and things take their inevitable course. But Banks is plagued with doubts as to exactly what happened outside the church that day, and why.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Struggling with the death of his first serious girlfriend and the return of profiler Jenny Fuller into his life, Banks feels the need to dig deeper into the murders, and as he does so, he uncovers forensic and psychological puzzles that lead him to the past secrets that might just provide the answers he is looking for. When the surprising truth becomes clear, it is almost too late.”</p>

Tonight he claims he will reveal an astonishing scientific breakthrough to challenge the fundamentals of human existence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You come home after a long day at work, ready for dinner with your wife. But she’s not there. And it looks like she left in a blind panic. Her mobile phone and her bag are still in the house.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But why would she go there? Was she running towards something? Away from something? The police think she was up to no good. You refuse to believe it. Then you start to wonder. You’ve been married for three years and you thought you knew her better than anyone on earth. But maybe you don’t.”</p>

</blockquote>

His dream of a kingdom of all England will stand or fall on one field and the passage of a single day.

  <p>“Fredrik Welin is a 70-year-old retired doctor. Years ago he retreated to the Swedish archipelago, where he lives alone on an island. He swims in the sea every day, cutting a hole in the ice if necessary. He lives a quiet life. Until he wakes up one night to find his house on fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fredrik escapes just in time, wearing two left-footed wellies, as neighbouring islanders arrive to help douse the flames. All that remains in the morning is a stinking ruin and evidence of arson. The house that has been in his family for generations and all his worldly belongings are gone. He cannot think who would do such a thing, or why. Without a suspect, the police begin to think he started the fire himself.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jojo, Bess’s stepdaughter, has a point to make. Bess is not her mother, and she won’t replace the one she’s been missing every day for the last two years. And will she ever get the chance to become a mum herself? Cousin Cari is a fierce career-woman who isn’t unnerved by anything - apart from facing the man who left her at the altar, and he’s on the guestlist. Her job has been a safe place to hide ever since - but is it time to let love into her life again?”</p>

  <p>“MGB officer Leo is a man who never questions the Party Line. He arrests whomever he is told to arrest.

  <p>“But suddenly his confidence that everything he does serves a great good is shaken. He is forced to watch a man he knows to be innocent be brutally tortured. And then he is told to arrest his own wife. Leo understands how the State works: Trust and check, but check particularly on those we trust. He faces a stark choice: his wife or his life. And still the killings of children continue…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Twenty years ago, Dennis Danson was arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of a young girl in Florida’s Red River County.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now he’s the subject of a true-crime documentary that’s whipping up a frenzy online to uncover the truth and free him from his wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thousands of miles away in England, Samantha is obsessed with Dennis’s case. She exchanges letters with him, and is quickly won over by his apparent charm and kindness to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Soon she has left her old life behind to marry him and campaign for his release.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when the campaign is successful and Dennis is freed, Sam begins to discover new details that suggest he may not be quite so innocent after all.</p>

  <p>“2017 marked the 40th anniversary of <cite>The News Quiz</cite>, ‘the finest topical comedy panel game known to radio’ and a guaranteed provider of headlines, punchlines and sparkling satirical wit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The panellists in these four shows from Series 92 and 93 find the funny in topics ranging from Donald Trump to Morris dancing, and from by-elections to pie selections, taking in Brexit, Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, urban foxes and an unorthodox lifeguard recruitment drive – not to mention the small matter of a UK General Election. To add to the hilarity, newsreaders Alan Smith, Corrie Corfield and Kathy Clugston read a selection of humorous press cuttings contributed by listeners.”</p>

  <p>“Detective Garda Cathy Connolly’s life has taken an unexpected turn. Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, Cathy’s struggling with how she’s going to balance motherhood with the very real dangers of life on the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Called to what seems like a routine break-in, Cathy discovers a baby’s bones concealed in the hem of an old wedding dress. When the dress’s original owner, Lavinia Grant, is found dead, Cathy is drawn deep into a complex web of secrets and lies spun by three generations of women.</p>

  <p>“June 1939. England is partying like there is no tomorrow, gas masks at the ready… but the good times won’t last. In Europe, the Nazis have invaded Czechoslovakia, and in Germany Jewish persecution is rife. Closer to home, the IRA has embarked on a bombing campaign throughout Britain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But the most far-reaching event of all goes largely unreported: in Germany, Otto Hahn has made the atomic bomb possible. German High Command fears that Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory could be close behind; they must discover its secrets before it is safe to wage war.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When one of the Cavendish’s finest brains is murdered, Professor Tom Wilde is drawn into the investigation. He unveils a conspiracy in which the fate of the world rests on the discovery of a kidnapped child. Can Tom Wilde discover the truth before it is too late?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this side-splitting sequel to his bestselling history, David Hunt takes us to the Australian frontier. This was the Wild South, home to hardy pioneers, gun-slinging bushrangers, directionally challenged explorers, nervous indigenous people, Caroline Chisholm and sheep. Lots of sheep.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>True Girt</cite> introduces Thomas Davey, the hard-drinking Tasmanian governor who invented the Blow My Skull cocktail, and Captain Moonlite, Australia’s most famous LGBTI bushranger. Meet William Nicholson, the Melbourne hipster who gave Australia the steam-powered coffee roaster and the world the secret ballot. And say hello to Harry, the first camel used in Australian exploration, who shot dead his owner, the explorer John Horrocks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is the secret of Birdy’s dead grandmother’s cat – how the boys tortured it and Birdy Flynn had to drown her in the river to stop her suffering. There’s the secret of Mrs Cope, the popular teacher, who touched Birdy in the cupboard. There’s the secret of the gypsy girl at school who Birdy likes, but she can’t tell anyone. Because Birdy’s other secret is that while she plays and fights as good as the boys, she is a girl, and she doesn’t always feel like a girl is supposed to.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Her beloved Irish mother has her own troubles, as does the rest of her rowdy family. So Birdy decides to do what she feels she has to – hold onto her secrets and try and become what others want, even if it means suffering and the risk of losing herself.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Online sensation, fearless feminist heroine and scourge of trolls and misogynists everywhere, Clementine Ford is a beacon of hope and inspiration to thousands of women and girls. Her incendiary debut, Fight Like a Girl, is an essential manifesto for feminists new, old and soon to be, and exposes just how unequal the world continues to be for women. Crucially, it is a call to arms for all women to rediscover the fury that has been suppressed by a society that still considers feminism a threat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Fight Like a Girl</cite> will make you laugh, cry and scream. But above all it will make you demand and fight for a world in which women have real equality and not merely the illusion of it.”</p>
