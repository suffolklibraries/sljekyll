<h3 id="the-girl-in-the-woods-by-camilla-läckberg-read-by-robin-bowerman"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2374102"><cite>The Girl in the Woods</cite>, by Camilla Läckberg, read by Robin Bowerman</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When a four-year-old girl disappears in the woods just outside Fjällbacka, the community is horror-struck. 30 years ago, a young girl went missing from the exact same spot, and was later discovered, murdered. Back then, two teenage girls were found guilty of the killing. Could it really be a coincidence that one of the girls - now a world-famous actress - has just returned to Fjällbacka?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Detective Patrik Hedström starts investigating, with his wife, bestselling crime writer Erica Falck, by his side. But as Patrik and Erica dig deeper, the truth becomes ever murkier, because it seems that everyone in the tight-knit community is hiding something. And soon, the residents must confront the fact that they could be harbouring a murderer in their midst.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-perfectly-imperfect-woman-by-milly-johnson-read-by-colleen-prendergast"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2345989"><cite>The Perfectly Imperfect Woman</cite>, by Milly Johnson, read by Colleen Prendergast</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Marnie Salt has made so many mistakes in her life that she fears she will never get on the right track. But when she ‘meets’ an old lady on a baking chatroom and begins confiding in her, little does she know how her life will change. Arranging to meet, Marnie discovers that Lilian is every bit as delightful as she’d hoped - and that she owns a whole village in the Yorkshire Dales. And when Marnie needs a refuge after a crisis, she ups sticks and heads for Wychwell.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But soon Marnie finds that Wychwell has claimed her as its own. Even if what she has to do makes her as unpopular as a force 12 gale in a confetti factory!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="have-you-seen-her-by-karen-rose-read-by-robert-g-slade"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2345990"><cite>Have You Seen Her?</cite>, by Karen Rose, read by Robert G. Slade</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Special Agent Steven Thatcher has a lot on his hands. Not only is there a serial killer of teenage girls on the loose, but Steven’s own teenage son Brad is suddenly acting up and failing at school.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tinkers-by-paul-harding-read-by-christian-rummel"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2350319"><cite>Tinkers</cite>, by Paul Harding, read by Christian Rummel</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An old man lies dying. Confined to bed in his living room, he sees the walls around him begin to collapse, the windows come loose from their sashes, and the ceiling plaster fall off in great chunks, showering him with a lifetime of debris: newspaper clippings, old photographs, wool jackets, rusty tools, and the mangled brass works of antique clocks. Soon, the clouds from the sky above plummet down on top of him, followed by the stars, till the black night covers him like a shroud.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He is hallucinating, in death throes from cancer and kidney failure. A methodical repairer of clocks, he is now finally released from the usual constraints of time and memory to rejoin his father, an epileptic, itinerant peddler, whom he had lost seven decades before.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="look-for-me-by-lisa-gardner-read-by-regina-reagan"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2389608"><cite>Look for Me</cite>, by Lisa Gardner, read by Regina Reagan</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Detective DD Warren and Flora Dane return in a race against time to save a young girl’s life - or bring her to justice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-bad-mother-by-amanda-brooke-read-by-georgia-maguire"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2374916"><cite>The Bad Mother</cite>, by Amanda Brooke, read by Georgia Maguire</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Newly married, newly pregnant, Lucy Robin is having trouble remembering the little things. Like what day she’s due to visit her mother. Or where she left her shoes. Or whether she’s left the gas hob on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Forgetting the little things is annoying, but the more it happens, the more scared she gets. As her world gets smaller, soon both Lucy’s life, and that of her unborn baby, are placed in danger. But is there something more sinister behind Lucy’s forgetfulness? Her husband doesn’t think so. And Adam always knows best.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-devils-dice-by-roz-watkins-read-by-caro-clarke"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2375702"><cite>The Devil’s Dice</cite>, by Roz Watkins, read by Caro Clarke</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A lawyer is found dead in a Peak District cave, his face ribboned with scratches. Amidst rumours of a local curse, DI Meg Dalton is convinced this is cold-blooded murder. There’s just one catch - chiselled into the cave wall above the body is an image of the grim reaper and the dead man’s initials, and it’s been there for over a century.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As Meg battles to solve the increasingly disturbing case, it’s clear someone knows her secrets. The murderer is playing games with Meg - and the dice are loaded.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="report-for-murder-by-val-mcdermid-read-by-caroline-guthrie"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2366482"><cite>Report for Murder</cite>, by Val McDermid, read by Caroline Guthrie</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freelance journalist Lindsay Gordon is strapped for cash. Why else would she agree to cover a fund-raising gala at a girls’ public school? But when the star attraction is found garrotted with her own cello string minutes before she is due on stage, Lindsay finds herself investigating a vicious murder. Who would have wanted Lorna Smith Cooper dead? And who could have slipped out of the hall at just the right time to commit this cold-blooded crime?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="force-of-nature-by-jane-harper-read-by-steve-shanahan"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392825"><cite>Force of Nature</cite>, by Jane Harper, read by Steve Shanahan</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Five women reluctantly pick up their backpacks and start walking along the muddy track. Only four come out the other side. The hike through the rugged landscape is meant to take the office colleagues out of their air-conditioned comfort zone and teach resilience and team building. At least that is what the corporate retreat website advertises.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Federal Police Agent Aaron Falk has a particularly keen interest in the whereabouts of the missing bushwalker. Alice Russell is the whistleblower in his latest case - and Alice knew secrets. About the company she worked for and the people she worked with. Far from the hike encouraging teamwork, the women tell Falk a tale of suspicion, violence and disintegrating trust. And as he delves into the disappearance, it seems some dangers may run far deeper than anyone knew.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mercy-killing-by-lisa-cutts-read-by-deryn-edwards"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392828"><cite>Mercy Killing</cite>, by Lisa Cutts, read by Deryn Edwards</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The death of a local sex offender places the police officers at East Rise incident room under immense pressure - they must treat this case like any other murder, but they know what Albie Woodville did and can feel little sympathy. Except, as the investigation progresses, it becomes clear this isn’t just a one-off killing - someone is out for revenge.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="greeks-bearing-gifts-by-philip-kerr-read-by-jeff-harding"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392824"><cite>Greeks Bearing Gifts</cite>, by Philip Kerr, read by Jeff Harding</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“1957, Munich. Bernie Gunther’s latest move in a long string of varied careers sees him working for an insurance company. It makes a kind of sense: both cops and insurance companies have a vested interest in figuring out when people are lying to them, and Bernie has a lifetime of experience to call on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sent to Athens to investigate a claim from a fellow German for a ship that has sunk, Bernie takes an instant dislike to the claimant. When he discovers the ship in question once belonged to a Greek Jew deported to Auschwitz, he is convinced the sinking was no accident but an avenging arson attack. Then the claimant is found dead, shot through both eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s a win for Bernie’s employers at least: no one to pay out to even if the claim is genuine. But who is behind the murder, and why?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-last-hour-by-harry-sidebottom-read-by-dugald-bruce-lockhart"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392858"><cite>The Last Hour</cite>, by Harry Sidebottom, read by Dugald Bruce Lockhart</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A lone figure stands silhouetted atop the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Far below, the river is in full flood. The City of Rome lies spread out before him on the far bank. Footsteps pound up the stairs. He’s been set up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An enemy is closing in; he is cornered. He jumps. Bruised and battered, he crawls out of the raging river. He is alone and unarmed, without money or friends, trapped in a deadly conspiracy at the heart of the Empire. The City Watch has orders to take him alive; other, more sinister, forces want him dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As the day dies, he realises he has only 24 hours to expose the conspirators, and save the leader of the world. If the Emperor dies, chaos and violence will ensue. If the Emperor dies, every single person he loves will die. He must run, bluff, hide and fight his way across the Seven Hills. He must reach the Colosseum, and the Emperor. He must make it to The Last Hour.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-hoarder-by-jess-kidd-read-by-aoife-mcmahon"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392878"><cite>The Hoarder</cite>, by Jess Kidd, read by Aoife McMahon</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maud Drennan - underpaid carer and unintentional psychic - is the latest in a long line of dogsbodies for the ancient, belligerent Cathal Flood. Yet despite her best efforts, Maud is drawn into the mysteries concealed in his filthy, once-grand home. She realises that something is changing: Cathal, and the junk-filled rooms, are opening up to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With only her agoraphobic landlady and a troop of sarcastic ghostly saints to help, Maud must uncover what lies beneath Cathal’s decades-old hostility, and the strange activities of the house itself. And if someone has hidden a secret there, how far will they go to ensure it remains buried?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-silver-wolf-by-rob-sinclair-read-by-marston-york"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392829"><cite>The Silver Wolf</cite>, by Rob Sinclair, read by Marston York</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ex-intelligence agent James Ryker sets out on a revenge mission that takes him from the crystal waters of Mexico’s Caribbean coast right back to his country of birth, England. Once there, he stumbles upon a terrorist attack targeting his old employers. All the clues point to The Silver Wolf. But just who is he, and why is he hell-bent on punishing not just Ryker but his closest allies?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Brother and sister Peter and Adele Robinson never stood a chance. Dragged up by an alcoholic, violent father and a weak, beaten mother, their childhood in Manchester only prepared them for a life of crime and struggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But Adele is determined to break the mould. She studies hard at school and, inspired by her beloved grandmother Joyce, she finally makes a successful life for herself on her own.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Peter is not so lucky. Getting more and more immersed in the murky world of crime and gangs, his close bonds with Adele gradually loosen until they look set to break altogether.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no easy way to die. Unknown to DI Luc Callanach and the newly promoted DCI Ava Turner, a serial killer has Edinburgh firmly in his grip. The killer is taking his victims in the coldest, most calculating way possible - engineering slow and painful deaths by poison, with his victims entirely unaware of the drugs flooding their bloodstream until it’s too late.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But how do you catch a killer who hides in the shadows? A killer whose pleasure comes from watching pain from afar? Faced with their most difficult case yet, Callanach and Turner soon realise they face a seemingly impossible task.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everybody in Lochdubh knew about the Macho Man, a bully who claimed to be a professional wrestler. His insults and sneaking around caused concern. So when he challenged PC Macbeth to a public fight, it triggered an epidemic of bookmaking.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was two days after Christmas when Kinsey Millhone received the bank slip showing a credit for five thousand dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Alexandra Winslow takes solace in the mysteries she reads with her devoted father - and soon she is writing them herself, graduating to dark, complex crime stories that reflect skill, imagination and talent far beyond her years. Alex writes in every spare moment, gripped by the plots and themes and characters that fill her mind. Midway through college, she has finished a novel - and manages to find a seasoned agent, then a publisher.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But as she climbs the ladder of publishing success, she resolutely adheres to her father’s admonition: Men read crime thrillers by men only - and so she publishes under a male pseudonym, her true identity known known only to those closest to her - creating a double life that isolates her. Her secret life - and her own life as a talented young woman - exposes her to the envious, the arrogant and Hollywood players who have no idea who she really is.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sensual, rebellious Anna falls deeply and passionately in love with the handsome Count Vronsky. When she refuses to conduct the discreet affair that her cold, ambitious husband—and Russian high society—would condone, she is doomed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Set against the tragic love of Anna and Vronsky, the plight of the melancholy nobleman Konstantine Levin unfolds. In doubt about the meaning of life — a mirror of Tolstoy’s own spiritual crisis — Konstantine is haunted by thoughts of suicide. Through these and other characters, Tolstoy weaves a vast and rich tapestry of nineteenth-century Russian society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A magnificent drama of vengeance, infidelity, and retribution, Anna Karenina tells the story of two characters whose emotional instincts conflict with the dominant social mores of their time.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Only two kilometres wide and three long, Entry Island is home to a population of around 130 inhabitants—  the wealthiest of which has just been discovered murdered in his home.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Detective Sime Mackenzie arrives from Montreal, but the investigation itself appears little more than a formality. The evidence points to a crime of passion: the victim’s wife the vengeful culprit. But Sime is convinced that he knows the victim’s wife — even though they have never met.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maud is forgetful. She makes a cup of tea and doesn’t remember to drink it. She sometimes thinks her daughter Helen is a total stranger. But there’s one thing Maud is sure of: her friend Elizabeth is missing. The note in her pocket tells her so. And no matter who tells her to stop going on about it, Maud will get to the bottom of it.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“John McGuinness is one of the all-time giants of road racing, with a huge host of victories to his name. But his easy humour and down-to-earth attitude off the bike have always kept people guessing: what’s the truth about the man inside the helmet, that has kept him at the top of such a sport for over 20 years?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“His autobiography tells the whole story, from his humble beginnings in Morecambe and getting his first bike at the age of 3, to working as a bricklayer and cockle fisherman before deciding to follow his dream, and finally to his many victories in the most dangerous sporting event on the planet. He tells of what it takes to be a champion in such an exacting sport, and to keep winning even though all logic tells you to stop – and when so many of your fellow racers are paying the ultimate price for doing it.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> is the true story of Frank W. Abagnale — alias Frank Williams, Robert Conrad, Frank Adams, and Robert Monjo — one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history. In his brief but notorious criminal career, Abagnale donned a pilot’s uniform and copiloted a Pan Am jet, masqueraded as the supervising resident of a hospital, practiced law without a license, passed himself off as a sociology professor, and cashed over $2.5 million in forged checks, all before he was twenty-one. Abagnale lived a sumptuous life on the lam — until the law caught up with him.”</p>

  <p>“Ember Hill has learned a shocking truth about herself: she is the blood of the Elder Wyrm, the ancient dragon who leads Talon and who is on the verge of world domination. With the Order of St. George destroyed, Ember, Riley, and Garret journey to the Amazon jungle in search of one who might hold the key to take down the Elder Wyrm and Talon - if they can survive the encounter.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Meanwhile, Ember’s brother, Dante, will travel to China with a message for the last Eastern dragons: join Talon or die. With the stakes rising and the Elder Wyrm declaring war, time is running out for the rogues and any dragon not allied with Talon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The final battle approaches. And if Talon is victorious, the world will burn.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Longtime defense attorney Mickey Haller is recruited to change stripes and prosecute the high-profile retrial of a brutal child murder. After 24 years in prison, convicted killer Jason Jessup has been exonerated by new DNA evidence. Haller is convinced Jessup is guilty, and he takes the case on the condition that he gets to choose his investigator, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Together, Bosch and Haller set off on a case fraught with political and personal danger. Opposing them is Jessup, now out on bail, a defense attorney who excels at manipulating the media, and a runaway eyewitness reluctant to testify after so many years.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With the odds and the evidence against them, Bosch and Haller must nail a sadistic killer once and for all. If Bosch is sure of anything, it is that Jason Jessup plans to kill again.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Six years have passed since Jake Fisher watched Natalie, the love of his life, marry another man. But six years haven’t extinguished his feelings, and when Jake comes across her husband’s obituary, he can’t keep away from the funeral. There he catches a glimpse of the grieving widow… but she is not Natalie. As Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel and soon even his life is at risk…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s the Summer Solstice weekend, and 150,000 people have descended on a farm in the North East of England for an open-air music festival. Reporting on the event is journalist Zoe Meadows, who files her copy from a food van run by her friends Sam and Lisa.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When some of Sam’s customers get sick, it looks like food poisoning, and it’s exacerbated by the mud, rain and inadequate sanitary facilities. It’s assumed to be a 24-hour thing, until people get home and discover strange skin lesions, which ulcerate and turn septic. More people start getting ill – and dying.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What looked like a minor bug is clearly much more serious: a mystery illness that’s spreading fast and seems resistant to all antibiotics. Zoe teams up with Sam to track the outbreak to its source; meanwhile, can a cure be found before the disease becomes a pandemic?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why do you love your child? Is it because they’re a straight A student, a talented footballer? Or is it simply because they’re yours?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sarah and Phil love both their children, James and Lauren. The couple have the same hopes and aspirations as any parent. But their expectations are shattered when they discover that their perfect baby daughter has been born with a flaw; a tiny, but life-changing glitch that is destined to shape her future, and theirs, irrevocably. Over time the family adapt and even thrive. Then one day a blood test casts doubt on the very basis of their family. Lauren is not Phil’s child.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Suddenly, their precious family is on the brink of destruction. But the truth they face is far more complex and challenging than simple infidelity. It tests their capacity to love, each other and their children, and it raises the question of what makes – and what breaks – a family.”</p>

Both were army high-flyers. Both were acquainted with Jack Reacher. Both were forced to resign from the service.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now they’re both dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Found in their own homes, naked, in a bath full of paint. Apparent victims of an army man. A loner, a smart guy with a score to settle, a ruthless vigilante.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One split second decision and you could lose your child forever …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When single mother Jen Cornish sees her neighbour’s keys on the footpath outside her home, she has no idea the simple good deed of returning them will end in her fighting for her life – and that of her son, Charlie.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Soon, Jen is arrested for a crime committed in her neighbour’s house, and the police have damning evidence. Jen wonders, is she losing her mind, or is she being framed?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Desperate to clear her name, Jen must untangle a chilling web of lies, and there’s only one suspect on her list: her ex, Charlie’s father. But someone is watching her every move – and it isn’t just Jen who is in danger.</p>

  <p>“They’re watching her child too.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are many ruined castles in Scotland. One such lies outside the village of Drim. Hamish begins to hear reports that this castle is haunted and lights have been seen there at night, but he assumes it’s some children or maybe the local lads going there to smoke pot, or, worse, inject themselves with drugs. Hamish says to his policeman, Charlie ‘Clumsy’ Carson, that they will both spend a night there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The keening wind explains the ghostly noises, but when Charlie falls through the floor, Hamish finds the body of a dead man propped up in a corner of the cellar. After Charlie is airlifted to the hospital, Chief Detective Inspector Blair arrives to investigate the body, but there is none to be found. Dismissed as a drunk making up stories, Hamish has to find and identify the body and its killer before the ‘ghost’ can strike again.”</p>

  <p>“Orla and Conor Quinn are the perfect power couple: smart, successful and glamorous. But then the unthinkable happens. Their only son, Tom, is the victim of a deliberate hit-and-run.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Detective Garda Cathy Connolly has just left Tom’s parents when she is called to the discovery of another body, this time in Dillon’s Park, not far from where Tom Quinn was found. What led shy student Lauren O’Reilly to apparently take her own life? She was a friend of Tom’s and they both died on the same night – are their deaths connected and if so, how?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As Cathy delves deeper, she uncovers links to the Dark Web and a catalogue of cold cases, realising that those involved each have their own reasons for hiding things from the police. But events are about to get a lot more frightening…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On a typical late summer day, Julia Swann is on the phone with her husband, Michael, when the call abruptly goes dead. Then the news rolls in: A bomb has gone off at Penn Station, where Michael was waiting for a train home. New York City is in a state of chaos.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A frantic Julia races to the city to look for Michael, her panic interwoven with memories of meeting and falling in love with the husband she’s now desperate to find. When someone finds a flier she’s posted and tells her they may have seen her husband, her dreams seem to be answered. Yet as she tries to find him, her calls go unanswered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Weaving between the aftermath of the explosion and Julia’s memories of her life with Michael, new developments raise troubling questions. Did Michael survive the explosion? Why hasn’t he contacted her? What was he doing when their last call was cut off? Was he - or is he still - the man she fell in love with?”</p>
