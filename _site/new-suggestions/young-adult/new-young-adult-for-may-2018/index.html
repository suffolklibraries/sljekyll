<p>The much-anticipated conclusion to the amazing steampunk, intergalactic, super-inventive, locomotive-loving Railhead trilogy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Great Network is changing. New worlds, new alliances, new enmities. For Threnody the changes have brought great power. For Zen and Nova they have brought separation. For the trains that run from world to world, they have brought questions. Now all of them must find out what really matters to them and who they really are.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League - but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighbourhood behind, he can’t escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr King to find out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up - way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty police officer beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it’s Justyce who is under attack.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prequel to the Summoner series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Arcturus is just an orphaned stable boy when he accidentally summons a demon. As Hominum’s first common summoner, he becomes the key to a secret that the powerful nobility would do anything to keep hidden. He is immediately whisked away to Vocans Academy where the lost arts of summoning, spell craft and demonology are taught to the noble children of the Empire. In no time, Arcturus finds himself surrounded by enemies as noble teachers and students question his right to be there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But before he can even attempt to make friends, his life is turned upside down once again, for the Empire is in turmoil. Rebellion is simmering among the masses, and it will not be long before it boils over. Arcturus must choose a side or watch the Empire crumble.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Matt is new, quiet and shy. Jazzy is outspoken, popular, confident. They’d never normally be friends. But things in the village of Burnham Stone aren’t normal: Matt has seen something extraordinary up in Burnham Wood. And Jazzy is the only one who believes him. With the help of Matt’s little dog and Jazzy’s little sister, the two make surprising discoveries - and unleash such a powerful force that nothing can ever be the same again.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For 15-year-old Shamiso, struggling with grief and bewilderment following her father’s death, hope is nothing but a leap into darkness. For Tanyaradzwa, whose life has been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis, hope is the only reason to keep fighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As the two of them form an unlikely friendship, Shamiso begins to confront her terrible fear of loss. In getting close to another person, particularly someone who’s ill, isn’t she just opening herself up to more pain? And underpinning it all - what did happen to her father, the night of that strange and implausible car crash?”</p>
</blockquote>

Because in spite of a world that might not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to stay silent.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat - but real life isn’t always so rhythmic. An anomaly in her friend group, she’s the only child of a young, single mum, and her life is decidedly less privileged. And even though her mom knows she’s bisexual, she hasn’t mustered the courage to tell her friends - not even her openly gay BFF, Simon. So Leah really doesn’t know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ramona was only 5 years old when Hurricane Katrina changed her life forever. Since then, it’s been Ramona and her family against the world.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But juggling multiple jobs, her flaky mom and her well-meaning but ineffectual dad forces her to be the adult of the family. Now, with her sister, Hattie, pregnant, responsibility weighs more heavily than ever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="i-was-born-for-this-by-alice-oseman"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169215"><cite>I Was Born For This</cite>, by Alice Oseman</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For Angel Ahmadi, life is only about one thing: The Ark - a pop-rock trio of teenage boys who are currently taking the world by storm. Being part of The Ark’s fandom has given her everything - her friendships, her dreams, her place in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jimmy Kaga-Ricci owes everything to The Ark too. He’s their frontman - and playing in a band is all he’s ever dreamed of doing. It’s just a shame that recently everything in his life seems to have turned into a bit of a nightmare. Because that’s the problem with dreaming - eventually, inevitably, real life arrives with a wake-up call.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And when Angel and Jimmy are unexpectedly thrust together, they will discover just how strange and surprising facing up to reality can be.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publisher HarperCollins describes this as a ‘funny, wise, and heartbreakingly true coming of age novel … a stunning reflection of modern teenage life, and the power of believing in something - especially yourself.’</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Feyre, Rhys and their companions are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it a hard-earned reprieve.

<blockquote>
  <p>“One hot summer morning, Davie steps boldly out of his front door. The world he enters is very familiar - the little Tyneside town that has always been his home - but as the day passes, it becomes ever more dramatic and strange. A boy has been killed, and Davie thinks he might know who is responsible. He turns away from the gossip and excitement and sets off roaming towards the sunlit summit at the top of the town, where the real and imaginary world begin to blur.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Almond says: ‘I guess it embodies my constant astonishment at being alive in this beautiful, weird, extraordinary world.’</p>
