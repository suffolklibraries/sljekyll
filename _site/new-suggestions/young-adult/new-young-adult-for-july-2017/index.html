<blockquote>
  <p>“Awarded the Gold, Silver and Bronze trotters after a vote by their classmates on Facebook, Mireille, Astrid and Hakima are officially the three ugliest girls in their school, but does that mean they’re going to sit around crying about it? Well, yes, a bit, but not for long!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Climbing aboard their bikes, the trio set off on a summer roadtrip to Paris, their goal: a garden party with the French president. As news of their trip spreads they become stars of social media and television. With the eyes of the nation upon them the girls find fame, friendship and happiness, and still have time to consume an enormous amount of food along the way.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bailey ‘Mink’ Rydell has met the boy of her dreams. They share a love of films and talk all day - Alex is perfect. Well, apart from the fact that they’ve never actually met - and neither of them knows the other’s real name.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Bailey moves to sunny California to live with her dad, who happens to live in the same town as Alex, she decides to track him down. But finding someone based on online conversations alone proves harder than Bailey thought, and with her irritating but charismatic (and potentially attractive?) colleague Porter Roth distracting her at every turn, will she ever get to meet the mysterious Alex?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Kept by a ruthless gang, three children manage to escape from slavery. But freedom isn’t just waiting on the outside. Separated, scared and looking after a small child, Esra will do whatever she can to reunite with her friend Miran, who was captured by the police - the police who she mustn’t trust.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hiding in the shadows of the forest, Esra is found by a local boy, a boy with his own story. Together they will create a man out of mud. A man who will come to life and lead them through a dark labyrinth of tunnels until they finally have the courage the step above ground. Until they finally have the courage to speak their story. Until they finally have the courage to be free.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rita and Lo, sisters and best friends, have spent their lives on the wing - flying through the air in their trapeze act, never staying in one place for long. Behind the greasepaint and the glitter, they know that the true magic is the family they travel with. Until Lo meets a boy. Suddenly, she wants nothing more than to stay still. And as secrets start to tear apart the close-knit circus community, how far will Lo go to keep her feet on the ground?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Griff and Dylan are returning from a holiday with their parents, about to cross into Manhattan. And then it happens. A trailer from the lorry in front smashes into their car. Dylan and Griff’s parents are killed. The boys are suddenly orphans with nowhere to go until a kind aunt and uncle give them a new home in Wales.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now Dylan and Griff have everything they need - love, a happy home and future. But Dylan is worried about Griff: whether he is OK, whether he is copying with the terrible loss. He doesn’t seem to speak about it or really acknowledge it. And Dylan has something else that he needs to come to terms with too.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ZiZi likes to think of herself as a girly girl: her wardrobe is almost exclusively pink, her daily makeup routine can take upwards of an hour and she loves a bit of a flirt. Her best friend Loretta is very different: all of her clothes are black, she doesn’t wear any makeup whatsoever and she doesn’t like the way ZiZi dumbs herself down for boys - or her old-fashioned ideas about ‘a woman’s place’.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One day, they decide to make a bet. Can ZiZi stand looking like Loretta for longer than Loretta can bear dressing like ZiZi? As their summer unfolds - often hilariously - the pair are surprised to find they have a lot to learn from each other.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ash-and-quill-by-rachel-caine"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2173622"><cite>Ash and Quill</cite>, by Rachel Caine</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Held prisoner by the Burner forces in Philadelphia, Jess and his friends struggle to stay alive in the face of threats from both sides - but a stunning escape guarantees worse is coming. The Library now means to stop them by any means necessary, and they’ll have to make dangerous allies and difficult choices to stay alive. They have only two choices: face the might of the Great Library head on, or be erased from life, and the history of the world, for ever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="indigo-donut-by-patrice-lawrence"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2171172"><cite>Indigo Donut</cite>, by Patrice Lawrence</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bailey is 17, mixed race, lives with his mum and dad in Hackney and spends all his time playing guitar or tending to his luscious ginger afro. Indigo is 17 and new to London, having grown up in the care system after being found by her mum’s dead body as a toddler. All Indigo wants is to know who she really is.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Bailey and Indigo meet at sixth form, sparks fly. But when Bailey becomes the target of a homeless man who seems to know more about Indigo than is normal, Bailey is forced to make a choice he should never have to make.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="nemesis-by-brendan-reichs"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2173680"><cite>Nemesis</cite>, by Brendan Reichs</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s been happening since Min was eight. Every two years, on her birthday, the same man finds her and murders her in cold blood. But hours later she wakes up in a clearing just outside her hometown - alone, unhurt, and with all evidence of the crime erased. Across the valley, Noah just wants to be like everyone else. But he’s not. Nightmares of murder and death plague him too, though he does his best to hide the signs. And as the world around them begins to spiral towards panic and destruction, the two troubled teens discover that people have been lying to them their whole lives.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="songs-about-us-by-chris-russell"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2171174"><cite>Songs About Us</cite>, by Chris Russell</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Two months on from the explosive finale to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1983616"><cite>Songs About a Girl</cite></a>, Charlie’s life is almost back to normal again: rebuilding her relationship with her father, hanging out with best mate Melissa, and worrying about GCSEs. All the while, Gabe’s revelations about her mother are never far from her mind. And neither is Gabe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s not long before Charlie is pulled back into the world of Fire&amp;Lights - but the band seem different this time. But then again, so is she. Meanwhile, tensions between Gabe and Olly continue to run high, leading to more turmoil between the band members and press than ever before. But when Gabriel and Charlie stumble upon yet another startling truth that links them together - everything they have stands to implode in front of them.”</p>
</blockquote>
