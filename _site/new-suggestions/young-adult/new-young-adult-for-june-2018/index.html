<blockquote>
  <p>“Taran and her twin Hari never wanted to move to Firestone House. But when the rent was doubled overnight and Dad’s chemo meant he couldn’t work, they had to make this tower block their home. It’s good now though; they feel part of something here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When they start noticing boarded-up flats and glossy fliers for expensive apartments, they don’t think much of it - until Hari is caught up in a tragedy, and they are forced to go on the run. It’s up to the teenagers to uncover the sinister truth behind what’s going on in the block, before it blows their world apart.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publisher Hachette describes this as “an adrenaline-fuelled, powerful YA novel about young people taking charge of their own destiny. A novel about standing up and being counted.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thor is at a crossroads too. Soon, if he doesn’t make a decision, he’s gong to face the fade. Years ago, he was Marcie’s imaginary friend - then she cast him out, back to his own world. Thor is not real. And that’s a real problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But, like so many bookshops, Bennett’s has become a ‘casualty of the high street’ - it’s strapped for cash and going to be torn down. Paige is determined to save it but mobilising a small town like Greysworth is no mean feat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Time is ticking - but that’s not the only problem Paige has. How is she going to fend off the attractions of beautiful fellow artist, Blaine? And, more importantly, will his anarchist ways make or break her bookshop campaign?”</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>“When four Long Island teens plot to meet Fatima Ro, the elusive author of their favourite novel, they’re stunned when she befriends them and invites them into her eccentric life. Suddenly their lives seem charmed, and as they grow closer to their idol, they find themselves revealing their darkest secrets to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But a year later, Miri, Soleil, Jonah and Penny are shocked to discover that Fatima’s newly released YA novel is based on those same secrets. The revelations are devastating, and they can’t escape the spotlight. The friends’ interview transcripts, emails and journal entries reveal how willing they were to sacrifice everything to win Fatima’s approval - and how those sacrifices led to a tragedy from which one of them will never recover.”</p>

She befriends the rich and talented Bel, who longs for a part in a remake of a famous film. Bel is unpredictable, jealous, and crazy, but she opens up a new world for Nora, and that makes her irresistible.</p>
