  <p>“Leora is reeling: questioning everything she has ever known about her family and herself. As half-Marked and half-Blank, can she ever wholly belong in either fractured community? Mayor Longsight wants to use her as a weapon: to infiltrate Featherstone, home of the Blanks, and deliver them to him for obliteration. Leora longs for answers about her mysterious birth mother, and Featherstone may reveal them. But will she find solace and safety there or a viper’s nest of suspicion and secrets?”</p>

But Noah’s deaths have trained him, hardened him, to lead the strongest into the future - whatever that may be - at any cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Min Wilder knows that survival alone isn’t enough. In a violent world where brute force passes for leadership, it’s tempting just to let everyone else fight it out. But Min’s instincts rebel against allowing others to decide who lives and who dies. She’s ready to fight for what she believes in. And against anyone who might stand in her way.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Kiko Himura has always had a hard time saying exactly what she’s thinking.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But then Kiko doesn’t get into Prism, at the same time her abusive uncle moves back in with her family. So when she receives an invitation from her childhood friend to leave her small town and tour art schools on the west coast, Kiko jumps at the opportunity in spite of the anxieties and fears that attempt to hold her back. And now that she is finally free to be her own person outside the constricting walls of her home life, Kiko learns life-changing truths about herself, her past, and how to be brave.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ellie Frias disappeared long before she vanished. Tormented throughout middle school, she begins her freshman year with new clothes, new hair, and a plan: she doesn’t need to be popular, she just needs to blend in with the wallpaper. It’s a lonely existence, but at least no one’s tripping her in the halls.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In fact, no one notices her at all. Until Caleb Breward tells her she’s beautiful and makes her believe it. Ellie loves Caleb, but sometimes she doesn’t like him that much - his awkward smile, the possessive way he touches her, the tone he uses, how he ignores her one minute and can’t get enough the next. And on one black night, she discovers the monster her boyfriend really is. Ellie wasn’t the first victim, but now, trapped, she has to watch it happen again and again. She tries to hold onto her happier memories in order to get past the cold days, waiting for someone to find her.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jessa Whitworth knew she didn’t belong in her ex-boyfriend Caleb’s room. But she couldn’t deny that she was everywhere - in his photos, his neatly folded T-shirts, even the butterfly necklace in his jeans pocket - the one she gave him for safe keeping on that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“His mother asked her to pack up his things - even though she blames Jessa for his accident. How could she say no? And maybe, just maybe, it will help her work through the guilt she feels about their final moments together. But as Jessa begins to box up the pieces of Caleb’s life, they trigger memories that make Jessa realize their past relationship may not be exactly as she remembered.”</p>
