<h2 id="maddie-smith8217s-review">Maddie Smith’s review:</h2>

<p>It’s become common practice for authors to reimagine past literary characters. Sebastian Faulks has resurrected Bond with glamour and riot in <cite>Devil May Care</cite> and Anthony Horowitz has continued the surreptitious adventures of Sherlock Homes in <cite>The House of Silk</cite>. Yet, the Agatha Christie estate has kept Poirot behind the bars he has placed so many criminals behind for nearly 40 years. That is, until Sophie Hannah was given permission to recommence his role in <cite>The Monogram Murders</cite>, released in September 2014.</p>

<p><cite>The Monogram Murders</cite> is a brilliant tale of deception, scandal, love and redemption – all the classic motifs and tropes you would expect to find in a bestselling Christie novel. This energy is captivated right from the very beginning of the novel, when an alarmed young woman named Jennie runs into Pleasant’s Coffee House where detective Poirot is musing on his past successes. Distracted and frightened, Jennie warns Poirot she will soon be dead and that this crime must be left unsolved. The next day three identical murders occur at The Bloxham Hotel, two women and one man, all are positioned on their backs with a gold cufflink placed in their mouths which bears the monogram PIJ. Who these people are and why they have been killed sets the plot of Hannah’s story into motion, taking the reader back 16 years to a village plagued by a terrible event.</p>

<p>Yet, this is not a simple who-dunnit story. The density to this murder mystery is complex, and at times confusing. Hannah’s capacity to intrigue and trick the reader is commendable, and her word-play remarkable. This is a book where every word has a significant value. As Poirot teaches his companion Edward Catchpool, nothing should be taken as face-value or superficial. The smallest details are scrutinised in detail, where dialect and language become clues to solving this murder. It is this magnitude for mystery and detail that solidifies Hannah’s status both as a brilliant crime writer in her own accord, and as a worthy individual to continue Christie’s Poirot.</p>

<p>However, this could also be the book’s downfall. Its density and magnitude for detail is compelling, but also has the capacity to confuse the reader. At nearly 400 pages, this is a book that is to be read over a period of days or weeks, and as such retention of the important information Poirot elucidates becomes hard to remember. I found myself returning to the book having forgotten the detail I knew was essential to remember. While a certain amount of confusion and detail is necessary to a good crime story, at times Hannah’s writing felt inundated and overwhelming. Without giving a spoiler to the book’s ending, its believability definitely causes trouble too.</p>

<p>This aside, I found <cite>The Monogram Murders</cite> a captivating read from start to finish. I truly couldn’t put the put the book down. Hannah’s brilliance at treading the line between channelling Agatha Christie’s storytelling and inserting her own personality as a writer has created a book that can satisfy the loyal Christie fans as well as all crime-fiction lovers. This isn’t an Agatha Christie book but an excellent reimagining of a much loved literary character, as Hannah herself has said she is not ‘updating’ or ‘reviving’ Poirot, but simply “writing about him”.</p>

<p>Without question, the Christie name and context of a resistant literary estate adds to <cite>The Monogram Murders</cite> notoriety and significance, but it should also receive acclaim from Hannah’s excellent writing, as it creates a plot that tricks and compels from start to finish.</p>
