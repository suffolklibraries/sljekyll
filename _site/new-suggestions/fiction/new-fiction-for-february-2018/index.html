<p>This book is already popular, with a long waiting list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dr Ruth Galloway is flattered when she receives a letter from Italian archaeologist Dr Angelo Morelli, asking for her help. He’s discovered a group of bones in a tiny hilltop village near Rome but doesn’t know what to make of them. It’s years since Ruth has had a holiday, and even a working holiday to Italy is very welcome!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So Ruth travels to Castello degli Angeli, accompanied by her daughter Kate and friend Shona. In the town she finds a baffling Roman mystery and a dark secret involving the war years and the Resistance. To her amazement she also soon finds Harry Nelson, with Cathbad in tow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But there is no time to overcome their mutual shock - the ancient bones spark a modern murder, and Ruth must discover what secrets there are in Castello degli Angeli that someone would kill to protect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New title from one of this country’s best writers, set in the 1960s.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"”Would you rather love the more, and suffer the more; or love the less, and suffer the less? That is, I think, finally, the only real question.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“First love has lifelong consequences, but Paul doesn’t know anything about that. At 19, he’s proud of the fact his relationship flies in the face of social convention. As he grows older, the demands placed on Paul by love become far greater than he could possibly have foreseen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New novel from the author of the hugely successful <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080567"><cite>The Dry</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is Alice here? Did she make it? Is she safe? In the chaos, in the night, it was impossible to say which of the four had asked after Alice’s welfare. Later, when everything got worse, each would insist it had been them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Five women reluctantly pick up their backpacks and start walking along the muddy track. Only four come out the other side. The hike through the rugged landscape is meant to take the office colleagues out of their air-conditioned comfort zone and teach resilience and team building. At least that is what the corporate retreat website advertises.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Federal Police Agent Aaron Falk has a particularly keen interest in the whereabouts of the missing bushwalker. Alice Russell is the whistleblower in his latest case - and Alice knew secrets. About the company she worked for and the people she worked with.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="london-rules-by-mick-herron"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2318784"><cite>London Rules</cite>, by Mick Herron</a></h2>

<p>The fifth Jackson Lamb novel from our recent <a href="/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-mick-herron/">Meet the Author</a> interviewee.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘London Rules’ might not be written down, but everyone knows rule one. Cover your arse.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Regent’s Park’s First Desk, Claude Whelan, is learning this the hard way. Tasked with protecting a beleaguered prime minister, he’s facing attack from all directions himself: from the showboating MP who orchestrated the Brexit vote, and now has his sights set on Number Ten; from the showboat’s wife, a tabloid columnist, who’s crucifying Whelan in print; from the PM’s favourite Muslim, who’s about to be elected mayor of the West Midlands, despite the dark secret he’s hiding; and especially from his own deputy, Lady Di Taverner, who’s alert for Claude’s every stumble.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Meanwhile, the country’s being rocked by an apparently random string of terror attacks, and someone’s trying to kill Roddy Ho.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-hoarder-by-jess-kidd"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2318809"><cite>The Hoarder</cite>, by Jess Kidd</a></h2>

<p>Outstanding new novel from the author of the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2152566"><cite>Himself</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maud Drennan - underpaid carer and unintentional psychic - is the latest in a long line of dogsbodies for the ancient, belligerent Cathal Flood.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yet despite her best efforts, Maud is drawn into the mysteries concealed in his filthy, once-grand home. She realises that something is changing: Cathal, and the junk-filled rooms, are opening up to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With only her agoraphobic landlady and a troop of sarcastic ghostly saints to help, Maud must uncover what lies beneath Cathal’s decades-old hostility, and the strange activities of the house itself. And if someone has hidden a secret there, how far will they go to ensure it remains buried?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hellbent-by-gregg-hurwitz"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2318165"><cite>Hellbent</cite>, by Gregg Hurwitz</a></h2>

<p>The third Orphan X thriller from another recent <a href="/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-gregg-hurwitz/">Meet the Author</a> interviewee. Expect a breakneck pace.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To some he was Orphan X. Others knew him as the Nowhere Man. But to Jack Johns he was a boy named Evan Smoak. Taken from an orphanage, Evan was raised inside a top secret government programme and trained to become a lethal weapon. By Jack. And yet for all the dangerous skill he instilled in his young charge, Jack Jones cared for Evan like a son.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But Jack knew too much about a programme that had gone rotten - he was a loose end that needed to be dealt with. But if you go after the only person who ever treated him like a human being, you can guarantee that the Nowhere Man will be coming for you. Hellbent on making things right.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="an-unsuitable-match-by-joanna-trollope"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2328277"><cite>An Unsuitable Match</cite>, by Joanna Trollope</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rose Woodrowe is getting married to Tyler Masson - a wonderful, sensitive man who is head-over-heels in love with her. The only problem? This isn’t the first time for either of them. And when you marry later in life there are a lot more people to consider. Like Rose’s daughter, Laura, who remembers her mom’s first marriage and doesn’t want her to get hurt again. Or the twins, Emmy and Nat, who are used to their mom being there for them whenever and for whatever they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And then there’s Tyler’s children: Mallory, a young actress who craves her father’s attention; and Seth, whose San Francisco bakery is just taking off and needs all the money he can get. Rose and Tyler are determined to get it right this time, but in trying to make everyone happy, can they ever be happy themselves?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2240709"><cite>Rattle</cite></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jakey has escaped with his life and moved to a new town. His rescue was a miracle but his parents know that the Collector is still out there, watching, waiting.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Bone Collector has a new apprentice to take over his family’s legacy. But he can’t forget the boy who got away and the detective who had destroyed his dreams.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="shadows-by-neil-gaiman-craig-p-russell--scott-hampton"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2318235"><cite>Shadows</cite>, by Neil Gaiman, Craig P. Russell &amp; Scott Hampton</a></h2>

<p>In this American Gods graphic novel:</p>

<p>This gothic tale, set in the 17th century, has a Daphne du Maurier feel to it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maybe you’ve heard tales about Scarcross Hall, the house on the old coffin path that winds from village to moor top. They say there’s something up here, something evil. Mercy Booth isn’t afraid. The moors and Scarcross are her home and lifeblood.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But, beneath her certainty, small things are beginning to trouble her. Three ancient coins missing from her father’s study, the shadowy figure out by the gatepost, an unshakeable sense that someone is watching. When a stranger appears seeking work, Mercy reluctantly takes him in. As their stories entwine, this man will change everything. She just can’t see it yet.”</p>
</blockquote>
