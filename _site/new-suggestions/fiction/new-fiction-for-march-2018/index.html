<h2 id="panic-room-by-robert-goddard"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2154011"><cite>Panic Room</cite>, by Robert Goddard</a></h2>

<p>Like our other Robert Goddard books, this is already racking up the reservations!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“High on a Cornish cliff sits a vast uninhabited mansion. Uninhabited except for Blake, a young woman of dubious background, secretive and alone, currently acting as housesitter. The house has a panic room. Cunningly concealed, steel lined, impregnable - and apparently closed from within. Even Blake doesn’t know it’s there. She’s too busy being on the run from life, from a story she thinks she’s escaped.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But her remote existence is going to be invaded when people come looking the house’s owner, missing rogue pharma entrepreneur, Jack Harkness. Suddenly the whole world wants to know where his money has gone. Soon people are going to come knocking on the door, people with motives and secrets of their own, who will be asking Blake the sort of questions she can’t - or won’t - want to answer. And will the panic room ever give up its secrets?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are not already aware of Samantha Harvey’s work, she has already appeared on longlists for the Booker and the Bailey’s Prize. Her new novel is set in the medieval period.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oakham, near Bruton, is a tiny village by a big river without a bridge. When a man is swept away by the river in the early hours of Shrove Saturday, an explanation has to be found. Was it murder, or suicide, or an accident?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The whole story is relayed by the village priest, John Reve, who in his role as confessor is privy to a lot of information that others have not. But will he be able to explain what happened to the victim, Tom Newman, the wealthiest, most capable and industrious man in the village? And what will happen if he can’t?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-perfect-girlfriend-by-karen-hamilton"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2333542"><cite>The Perfect Girlfriend</cite>, by Karen Hamilton</a></h2>

<p>In this debut thriller:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Juliette loves Nate. She will follow him anywhere. She’s even become a flight attendant for his airline, so she can keep a closer eye on him. They are meant to be. The fact that Nate broke up with her six months ago means nothing. Because Juliette has a plan to win him back. She is the perfect girlfriend. And she’ll make sure no one stops her from getting exactly what she wants. True love hurts, but Juliette knows it’s worth all the pain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This psychological thriller is bound to be popular. Anna Friel is already confirmed as the reader of the audiobook.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-lie-by-clare-mackintosh"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2334673"><cite>Let Me Lie</cite>, by Clare Mackintosh</a></h2>

<p>Another new psychological thriller, this time from the author of [<cite>I Let You Go](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1738493) and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2132001"><cite>I See You</cite></a>:</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The police say it was suicide. Anna says it was murder. They’re both wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One year ago, Caroline Johnson chose to end her life brutally: a shocking suicide planned to match that of her husband just months before. Their daughter, Anna, has struggled to come to terms with her loss ever since. Now with a young baby of her own, Anna misses her mother more than ever and starts to question her parents’ deaths. But by digging up their past, she’ll put her future in danger. Sometimes it’s safer to let things lie.”</p>

<p>The new title from the author of the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1963426"><cite>My Name is Leon</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Birmingham, 1972. Mona is a young Irish girl in a big city, with the thrill of a new job and a room of her own in a busy boarding house. On her first night out in town, she meets William, a charming Irish boy with an easy smile and an open face. They embark upon a dizzying love affair, a whirlwind marriage, an unexpected pregnancy - before a sudden tragedy tears them apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Decades later, Mona pieces together the memories of the years that separate them. But can she ever learn to love again?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="money-in-the-morgue-by-stella-duffy--ngaio-marsh"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2333486"><cite>Money in the Morgue</cite>, by Stella Duffy &amp; Ngaio Marsh</a></h2>

<p>Stella Duffy has completed a unique crime novel the late Ngaio Marsh started during the Second World War:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s business as usual for Mr Glossop as he does his regular round delivering wages to government buildings scattered across New Zealand’s lonely Canterbury plains. But when his car breaks down he is stranded for the night at the isolated Mount Seager Hospital, with the telephone lines down, a storm on its way and the nearby river about to burst its banks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Trapped with him at Mount Seager are a group of quarantined soldiers with a serious case of cabin fever, three young employees embroiled in a tense love triangle, a dying elderly man, an elusive patient whose origins remain a mystery … and a potential killer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When the payroll disappears from a locked safe and the hospital’s death toll starts to rise faster than normal, can the appearance of an English detective working in counterespionage be just a lucky coincidence – or is something more sinister afoot?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-punishment-she-deserves-by-elizabeth-george"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2333530"><cite>The Punishment She Deserves</cite>, by Elizabeth George</a></h2>

<p>In the new Inspector Lynley mystery:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When a Member of Parliament shows up in the office of the Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard, trouble quickly follows. He is there to request an investigation into the suicide of the son of one of his constituents in the medieval town of Ludlow, who happens to be a wealthy brewer with a team of solicitors ready to file a major lawsuit over the death.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Assistant Commissioner sees two opportunities in this request: the first is to have an MP owing him a favour, and the second is to get rid of Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, whose career at the Met has been hanging by a thread for quite some time.”</p>
</blockquote>
