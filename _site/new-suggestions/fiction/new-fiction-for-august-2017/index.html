<p>Val McDermid is back with the latest instalment in her series featuring psychologist Tony Hill and former police detective Carol Jordan. In the north of England, single women are beginning to disappear from weddings. A pattern soon becomes clear: Someone is luring the women away - only to leave the victims’ bodies in their own burned-out cars in remote locations.</p>

<p>Lynda La Plante’s third book in the Tennison series finds Jane Tennison in the 1970s in the middle of a terrifying IRA bombing campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jane Tennison is now a fully-fledged detective. On the way to court one morning, Jane passes through Covent Garden Underground station and is caught up in a bomb blast that leaves several people dead, and many horribly injured. Jane is a key witness, but is adamant that she can’t identify the bomber. When a photograph appears in the newspapers, showing Jane assisting the injured at the scene, it puts her and her family at risk from IRA retaliation.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pushed to breaking point, Cara Burrows abandons her home and family and escapes to a five-star spa resort she can’t afford. Late at night, exhausted and desperate, she lets herself into her hotel room and is shocked to find it already occupied - by a man and a teenage girl.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A simple mistake on the part of the hotel receptionist - but Cara’s fear intensifies when she works out that the girl she saw alive and well in the hotel room is someone she can’t possibly have seen: the most famous murder victim in the country, Melody Chapa, whose parents are serving life sentences for her murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cara doesn’t know what to trust: everything she’s read and heard about the case, or the evidence of her own eyes. Did she really see Melody? And is she prepared to ask herself that question and answer it honestly if it means risking her own life?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A terrific premise, and as you would expect, Sophie delivers lots of twists, but more unexpectedly for me, she plays with the genre and is funny too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beartown is a small town in a large Swedish forest. For most of the year it is under a thick blanket of snow, experiencing the kind of cold and dark that brings people closer together - or pulls them apart. Its isolation means that Beartown has been slowly shrinking with each passing year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But now the town is on the verge of an astonishing revival. Everyone can feel the excitement. Change is in the air and a bright new future is just around the corner. Until the day it is all put in jeopardy by a single, brutal act. It divides the town into those who think it should be hushed up and forgotten and those who’ll risk the future to see justice done. At last, it falls to one young man to find the courage to speak the truth that it seems no one else wants to hear. With the town’s future at stake, no one can stand by or stay silent”</p>

<p>The 21st novel from the legendary 91-year-old creator of Inspector Montalbano.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An elderly man is found dead in the dining room of his Vigatan beach house; his coffee spilt across the table, a gunshot wound through the back of his head. The son who discovered the body has the most to gain from his father’s untimely death, and his sister is quick to point out the reasons why. But as Montalbano learns more about the victim’s dishonourable life, he soon finds half of Vigata has a motive for the murder.”</p>

<p>If you have not read any of Erik Storey’s books, his main character Clyde Barr is a Jack Reacher-like drifter, wandering the American highways. Like Reacher, trouble follows Barr wherever he does. In this one, he heads for the mountains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when he runs across an elderly sick man - a Ute Indian from a nearby reservation - Clyde’s dream of solitude is quickly dashed. On the reservation, Clyde finds the old man’s daughter, Lawana, and grandson, Taylor, as well as a group of menacing bikers called Reapers running wild in the struggling, half-abandoned village. Gripped by the desire to do good in a hard world, Clyde offers to stay on Lawana’s ranch to help out until her father is better. As tensions rise between the locals and the Reapers, Clyde’s efforts to protect the reservation become a fight for his, Lawana’s and Taylor’s lives.”</p>
