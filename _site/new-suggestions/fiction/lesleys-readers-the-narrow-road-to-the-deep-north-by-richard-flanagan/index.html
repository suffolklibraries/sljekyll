<p><img src="/images/featured/featured-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north.jpg" alt="The narrow road to the deep north by Richard Flanagan" /></p>

<p>Flanagan’s Man Booker Prize winning novel is an exploration of human relationships and the limits they are pushed to amid the atrocities of warfare. Set chiefly around the Japanese enslavement of Australian POWs and their suffering in building the impossible Burma-Siam railway, <cite>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</cite> is as much a story about camaraderie and compassion in war as it is about loss and tribulation.</p>

<p>Influenced undoubtedly by Flanagan’s father, who was a prisoner that endured and survived the trials of the Burma death railway, is the protagonist, Dorrigo Evans. Dorrigo is whimsical and infatuated with literature, constantly drawing upon poetry to fill his life with meaning and answers to the problems he faces. One of these problems is Amy, his uncle’s wife who he becomes infatuated with. Despite Dorrigo’s recent engagement and Amy’s marriage, the couple begin an affair together and while they hope for a future, this is shattered with the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>Dorrigo is sent overseas to Singapore to help with the war effort until its surrender in 1942, when he is then sent on to the ‘narrow road’ to help the Japanese build their impossible railway. It is on the railway that Flanagan’s haunting prose comes to life. Flanagan creates a vivid picture of life, where identity is crucial to survival. This theme is recurrent in the names of the men where they are associated with animals and their dehumanised, weakened bodies: Rabbit, Tiny, Rooster, Sheephead, Chum, and Lizard. The suffering of the men is disturbing and horrifying, with beatings, infection and malnourishment amounting for a myriad of deaths ‘on the line’ each day.</p>

<p><cite>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</cite> stands apart for its prose, which is both beautiful and haunting. It’s a bit of an idiosyncrasy to find beauty in warfare, but Flanagan’s writing is sensitive and the men’s camaraderie really helps to strike up a sense of beauty amid the suffering. I also appreciated that Flanagan allowed for the Japanese men to narrate portions of the novel. Having multiple narrators was at times challenging and does make the novel complex, but it gives a universal perspective of the suffering and helps to emphasise the Japanese were also victims – in their case, of an outdated honour system.</p>

<p>However, the novel is not completely harrowing or concerned with warfare. There is a whole sub-plot dedicated to Dorrigo’s relationship with Amy that helps place a sense of romance and idealism into the novel. Their relationship also reiterates the theme of flesh and bodies that runs throughout. Flanagan is perhaps suggesting the sensual world that Dorrigo longs to live in with Amy is the inverse of the world of destroyed bodies he inhabits at the railway. I enjoyed this sub-plot and especially the injection of a female character into the novel, as it brings a sense of romance into an otherwise bleak context.</p>

<p>Having visited Kanchanaburi in Thailand last year and walked over the infamous Bridge over the River Kwai, this book had a haunting resonance for me. I could visualise clearly the space that Dorrigo’s men worked and suffered in, but also remember the vast beauty of the mountainous landscape that surrounds the railway. Just like the prose of <cite>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</cite> shows, the railway is in real-life serene yet harrowing. Indeed, Flanagan’s novel offers a rich insight into the suffering on the Burma-railway while reminding of the strength of human-relationships to survive such hardships. If you like historical fiction or historical romance, you will enjoy this gripping novel.</p>
