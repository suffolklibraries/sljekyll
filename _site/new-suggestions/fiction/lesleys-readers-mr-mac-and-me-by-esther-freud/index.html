                <h1 class="custom-lh-title f2 pa0 ma0 mb3

                <p><img src="/images/featured/featured-mr-mac-and-me.jpg" alt="Mr Mac and me by Esther Freud" /></p>

<p>Split between acting as a biography, eulogy and fictional tale is Esther Freud’s newest novel, <cite>Mr Mac and Me</cite>. Based on the life of the artist and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Freud’s novel follows Mackintosh’s life after his move to Suffolk in 1914. With beautiful descriptions of the Suffolk coastline and quaint depictions of the seaside towns of Walberswick and Southwold, <a href="http://www.ipswichinstitute.org.uk/NAP.html"><cite>Mr Mac and Me</cite> has earned itself a New Angle Prize nomination</a>.</p>

<p>The novel is narrated by 12 year old Thomas Maggs, the only surviving son of six before him. He lives with his parents and two older sisters at their pub, The Blue Inn, and obtains work making rope with a local craftsman. However, Thomas is uninterested with his work or education; he is whimsical and idealistic and far more interested in adventure than mundane chores. The opportunity for adventure arises when Charles Rennie Mackintosh arrives in Walberswick. Mackintosh comes to Suffolk for artistic inspiration and to develop his skills as a painter, activities that captivate Thomas’ creativity and spur him to strike up a friendship with Mackintosh.</p>

<p>It is this friendship that allows Freud to explore the biographical elements of Mackintosh’s past and the difficulty he faced trying to establish a reputation for himself in Glasgow. Candid flashbacks reiterate how Mackintosh received little credit for his role in designing the now renowned Glasgow School of Art and negative peer-review left him with a wounded ego. Indeed, Mackintosh’s career was at a low during his time in Suffolk and Freud reminds us that if it were not for his equally talented artist-wife, Margaret Macdonald, Mackintosh would have struggled to maintain a livelihood.</p>

<p>The introduction of fictional Thomas Maggs into Freud’s novel is what allows Freud to inject romanticism into Mackintosh’s otherwise downbeat situation. Thomas has a young and idealistic perspective on the world and comes to associate Mackintosh’s life with the adventure he craves. However, the outbreak of World War I disrupts the duo’s friendship as the village community becomes suspicious of Mackintosh’s erratic behaviour. The artist is arrested on suspicion of being a spy and it is left to Thomas to prove his friend’s innocence.</p>

<p>The warfare overseas has a ubiquitous presence in the novel. It is responsible for the slaughter of a Suffolk regiment at sea and rips apart innocent lives back home. Blending historical fact into the lives of Thomas and Mackintosh enables Freud to reiterate the catastrophic effects World War I ravaged on not only soldiers, but civilians alike.</p>

<p><cite>Mr Mac and Me</cite> is a beautifully written and evocative novel that exposes the life of Charles Rennie Mackintosh with great passion. It is sad to reflect upon the truth in the novel, of Mackintosh’s inability to achieve success in his lifetime, but also inspiring that he posthumously achieved critical acclaim. Freud does a fantastic job of merging together a biographical account with fictional characters and has created a novel that has friendship at its heart.</p>

<h2 id="lesley8217s-review">Lesley’s review</h2>

<p>I found this book fascinating for two reasons; it’s a beautifully told story rooted firmly in Suffolk and it adds detail to the intriguing story of Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s short stay on the Suffolk coast. I had heard that he’d left the county after coming under suspicion of being a German spy, but didn’t know any of the detail and Esther Freud has filled in many of the gaps with her meticulous research, both about the famous architect and about life here in Suffolk at the start of the First World War.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be in conversation with Esther at the Felixstowe Book Festival when she told us how she’d really struggled until the young boy Thomas Maggs appeared. He narrates the story which tells of his friendship with Mackintosh and his wife. It’s a beautiful tale but also a sad biography – I had no idea that Charles Rennie Mackintosh wasn’t really appreciated during his lifetime.</p>
