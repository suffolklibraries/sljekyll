<h2 id="maddie-smith8217s-review">Maddie Smith’s review:</h2>

<p>This month, we are tying into the Brave New Reads reading programme. Brave New Reads is a regional reading initiative set up by the Writers’ Centre Norwich, that has six books it challenges its participants to read. These books are focussed on promoting world literature and encourage readers to explore more unconventional texts and genres.</p>

<p><cite>The Dead Lake</cite> is one of the chosen books. It is about the devastating effects of the cold-war on a Kazakh boy, with mystery and magic woven into the narration. The protagonist, Yerhzan, is twenty-seven years old but stuck within the body of a twelve-year old. The story of how and why Yerzhan stopped ageing is the premise to Ismailov’s novella, a story that carries with it symbolic meaning of what physical and emotional damage nuclear war wreaked on the citizens of Kazakhstan. It is after meeting the nameless narrator on a commuter train that Yerzhan begins to relate the story of his life so far. Born at the Kara-Shagan station nearby an atomic test site in Kazakhstan, Yerzhan is brought up by his mute mother and grandparents. He does not know his father, since his mother became pregnant after an encounter with an “alien”.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the novella Ismailov presents Yerzhan as a character struggling to understand his identity. He understands his life through the spirits of animals and fables his friends and family tell him. He constantly identifies himself to the fox cub his grandfather killed and attempts to trace his identity in the story of Wolfgang, a musician who falls to lust. Like Wolfgang, Yerzhan is deeply affected by lust. He is in love with his neighbour’s daughter, Aisulu, and it is in a moment of trying to impress her that he defies warnings and enters the lake. It is after this event that Yerzhan realises he has stopped growing.</p>

<p>Magic and surrealism surround the narrative of <cite>The Dead Lake</cite>. Fables, spiritualism and otherworldly transformations abound in the plot and are what allow Ismailov to create a link between the lost adulthood of a child and the devastating legacy left by the cold-war. Indeed, it is atomic testing that destroys the Kazakh steppe and creates the insidious lake that curtails Yerzhan’s growth. The symbolism may be challenging to decipher, but when you realise the message Ismailov is conveying, the novella emerges as an evocative vignette of an environment and people plagued by warfare. A picture that unfortunately can be compared to too many places still today. It is then shocking, but perhaps not surprising, that all of Ismailov’s works have been banned in neighbouring Uzbekistan. The blunt reality of what the USSR’s engagement in the cold-war impacted on its citizens is still being censored in those states involved.</p>

<p><cite>The Dead Lake</cite> is undoubtedly a challenging book to read. While it has been translated from Uzbek to English, there are still phrases and context native to Central Asia the reader has to contend with. I also felt that the book’s pace did begin quite slowly, but around mid-way through I was beginning to get really enveloped in the plot. At only 120 pages long the book’s length also compensates for its challenging plot line! That aside, <cite>The Dead Lake</cite> is a profoundly provocative book. Yerzhan’s story is sad but it also is surrounded by a culture and landscape that remain resilient in the face of man-made catastrophes.</p>
