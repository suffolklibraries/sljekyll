<blockquote>
  <p>“Husband and wife Ruairidh and Niamh Macfarlane co-own Ranish Tweed, a Hebridean company that weaves its own special variety of Harris cloth, which has become a sought-after brand in the world of high fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when Niamh learns of Ruairidh’s affair with Russian designer Irina Vetrov, then witnesses the pair killed by a car bomb in Paris, her life is left in ruins. Along with her husband’s remains, she returns home to the Isle of Lewis, bereft. The Paris police have ruled out terrorism, and ruled in murder - making Niamh the prime suspect, along with Irina’s missing husband, Georgy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And so French Detective Sylvie Braque is sent to the island to look into Niamh’s past, unaware of the dangers that await her. As Braque digs deeper into the couple’s history, Niamh herself replays her life with Ruiairidh, searching her memory for those whose grievances might have led to murder.”</p>

<p>In the two-time Booker Prize winner’s latest novel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Irene Bobs loves fast driving. Her husband is the best car salesman in rural south eastern Australia. Together with Willie, their lanky navigator, they embark upon the Redex Trial, a brutal race around the continent, over roads no car will ever quite survive.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Looking back, it all started on the day of the fair and the terrible accident. When twelve-year-old Eddie first met the Chalk Man. It was the Chalk Man who gave Eddie the idea for the drawings: a way to leave secret messages between his group of friends. And it was fun, to start with, until the figures led them to the body of a young girl.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That was thirty years ago and Ed thought the past was behind him. Then he receives a letter containing just two things: a piece of chalk, and a drawing of a stick figure. As history begins to repeat itself, Ed realises the game was never over.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our recent <a href="/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-c-j-tudor/">Meet the Author</a> interviewee’s debut novel is an early contender for thriller of the year, having been at the centre of a bidding frenzy between publishers. <cite>The Chalk Man</cite> has been described as a cross between Stephen King and <cite>Stranger Things</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One September evening in 1785, the merchant Jonah Hancock hears urgent knocking on his front door. One of his captains is waiting eagerly on the step. He has sold Jonah’s ship for what appears to be a mermaid.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As gossip spreads through the docks, coffee shops, parlours and brothels, everyone wants to see Mr Hancock’s marvel. Its arrival spins him out of his ordinary existence and through the doors of high society. At an opulent party, he makes the acquaintance of Angelica Neal, the most desirable woman he has ever laid eyes on - and a courtesan of great accomplishment. This meeting will steer both their lives onto a dangerous new course, on which they will learn that priceless things come at the greatest cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What will be the cost of their ambitions? And will they be able to escape the destructive power mermaids are said to possess?”</p>
</blockquote>
