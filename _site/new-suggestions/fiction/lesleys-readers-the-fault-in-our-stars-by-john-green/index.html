<p>My hand had often hovered over this book, but I always changed my mind due to the central theme of teenagers and cancer. I was never sure whether I would have a box of tissues large enough to get me through to the end.</p>

<p>Oh my, I am so glad I have read this so well observed and beautiful book. It has, at its centre, a love story between two American teenagers who are in remission. Hazel and Augustus meet at a kid’s cancer support group and it is their story but also their parents’ story and how families deal with what life is throwing at them. There are full on tissue box moments, one in particular which I never saw coming. However, at the same time it is a story of courage and love and making the most of the time we have.</p>

<p>I really loved this book. Do not be put off by the fact that it is published as teen fiction. Remember <cite>Twilight</cite>, a teen read enjoyed by many adults and surely I do not need to remind you of all those adults, myself included, trying to hide the cover of the various Harry Potter novels they were reading on the daily commute until the publisher printed adult friendly cover versions!</p>

<p>The film is out in June and looking at the trailer I am not certain whether or not it has managed to avoid ‘schmultz’, but what I can confirm is that the book never goes there.</p>

<p>Start reading and you will be hooked by the characters and will have to read to the end and unlike many books, this has a realistic, satisfying ending.</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-clouting8217s-review">Vanessa Clouting’s review:</h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book – despite the sadness of the subject. The humour between the characters was brilliant – and the teenage relationships with each other, their parents and the leader of the support group were very well described. I would thoroughly recommend this – it is appropriate for teenagers and adults too! An excellent reading group book I would suggest! I don’t want to see the film – just in case it spoils it!</p>

<h2 id="charmain-osborne8217s-review">Charmain Osborne’s review:</h2>

<p>I had heard a lot about this book from both adults and teenagers and I must admit I was a bit reluctant to read it. My main concern was that it was going to be a book about cancer.</p>

<p>Hazel and Augustus meet at a Cancer Kid Support Group where they form a deep friendship which has a profound impact on their lives. Yes, cancer is undeniably a feature of this story, although it’s also about much more, it does not define the characters or the book.</p>

<p>This is a story about love, living the life you’re given and making the most of every moment, the experiences we share with those that love us the most and the friendships we develop. What John Green creates in Hazel and Augustus along with their friends and families is a set of characters we come to care deeply about. I experienced a whole spectrum of emotions while reading this book; I cried as well as laughing out loud. <cite>The fault in our stars</cite> is one book I recommend to others.</p>
