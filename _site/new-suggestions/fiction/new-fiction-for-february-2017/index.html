<blockquote>
  <p>“Boiled human bones have been found in Norwich’s web of underground tunnels. When Dr Ruth Galloway discovers they were recently buried, DCI Nelson has a murder enquiry on his hands. The boiling might have been just a medieval curiosity - now it suggests a much more sinister purpose. Meanwhile, DS Judy Johnson is investigating the disappearance of a local rough sleeper. The only trace of her is the rumour that she’s gone ‘underground’. This might be a figure of speech, but with the discovery of the bones and the rumours both Ruth and the police have heard that the network of old chalk-mining tunnels under Norwich is home to a vast community of rough sleepers, the clues point in only one direction.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the ninth title in Suffolk Libraries Bookfest 2016 guest Elly Griffiths’ popular <cite>Ruth Galloway</cite> series, set just over the border in Norfolk. At the time of writing, there are already 124 reserves on it, so don’t delay.</p>

<p>The creation of another Bookfest 2016 guest, DC Gary Goodhew returns for a seventh Cambridge-based murder mystery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Amy was seven years old when her father was arrested for murder. His subsequent trial and conviction scarred her childhood and cast a shadow over her life until, 22 years later, new evidence suggests he was innocent and Amy sets out to clear his name. But Amy is not the only person troubled by the past. DC Gary Goodhew is haunted by the day his grandfather was murdered and is still searching for answers, determined to uncover the truth about his grandfather’s death and find his killer. But, right now, someone is about to die…”</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“20 years retired, David Cartwright can still spot when the stoats are on his trail. Radioactive secrets and unfinished business go with the territory on Spook Street: he’s always known there would be an accounting. And he’s not as defenceless as they might think. Jackson Lamb worked with Cartwright back in the day. He knows better than most that this is no vulnerable old man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mick Herron is the author of the <cite>Slough House</cite> novels, the first of which - the Steel-Dagger nominated <cite>Slow Horses</cite> - has been described as the “most enjoyable British spy novel in years”. The second <cite>Slough House</cite> novel, <cite>Dead Lions</cite>, won the 2013 CWA Goldsboro Gold Dagger, and was picked by the <cite>Sunday Times</cite> as one of the best 25 crime novels of the past five years.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bella’s fiancé is killed during the First World War. Rather than receiving sympathy in her grief, Bella is scorned at Philip’s funeral by the family she had hoped to join. Even her own mother says no good ever came of a woman trying to marry someone so different. With no one to turn to, Bella throws herself into war work and moves away from home. But a lawyer tracks her down as she’s been left something in Phillip’s will. The inheritance brings new problems and even dangers. Can she find her way through it and make a new life?”</p>

<p>MC Beaton continues to turn out bestselling books into her 80s. This one, in the Hamish MacBeth series, is based around a haunted castle and a ‘ghost’ killer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are many ruined castles in Scotland. One such lies outside the village of Drim. Hamish begins to hear reports that this castle is haunted and lights have been seen there at night, but he assumes it’s some children or maybe the local lads going there to smoke pot, or, worse, inject themselves with drugs. Hamish says to his policeman, Charlie ‘Clumsy’ Carson, that they will both spend a night there. The keening wind explains the ghostly noises, but when Charlie falls through the floor, Hamish finds the body of a dead man propped up in a corner of the cellar.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After Charlie is airlifted to the hospital, Chief Detective Inspector Blair arrives to investigate the body, but there is none to be found. Dismissed as a drunk making up stories, Hamish has to find and identify the body and its killer before the ‘ghost’ can strike again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-caller-by-chris-carter"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1986736"><cite>The Caller</cite>, by Chris Carter</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After a tough week, Tanya Kaitlin is looking forward to a relaxing night in, but as she steps out of her shower, she hears her phone ring. The video call request comes from her best friend, Karen Ward. Tanya takes the call and the nightmare begins. Karen is gagged and bound to a chair in her own living room. If Tanya disconnects from the call, if she looks away from the camera, he will come after her next, the deep, raspy, demonic voice at the other end of the line promises her. As Hunter and Garcia investigate the threats, they are thrown into a rollercoaster of evil, chasing a predator who scouts the streets and social media networks for victims, taunting them with secret messages and feeding on their fear.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The day Stacey Grant loses her job feels like the last day of her life. Or at least, the only life she’d ever known. For who was she if not a City high-flyer, Senior Partner at one of the top private equity firms in London? As Stacey starts to reconcile her old life with the new - one without professional achievements or meetings, but instead, long days at home with her dog and ailing mother, waiting for her successful husband to come home - she at least has The Girls to fall back on.”</p>
</blockquote>
