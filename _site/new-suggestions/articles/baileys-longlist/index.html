<blockquote>
  <p>“Yejide is hoping for a miracle, for a child. It is all her husband wants, all her mother-in-law wants, and she has tried everything - arduous pilgrimages, medical consultations, dances with prophets, appeals to God. But when her in-laws insist upon a new wife, it is too much for Yejide to bear. It will lead to jealousy, betrayal, and despair. Unravelling against the social and political turbulence of 80s Nigeria, this book sings with the voices, colours, joys, and fears of its surroundings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-power-by-naomi-alderman"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2040076"><cite>The Power</cite>, by Naomi Alderman</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In <cite>The Power</cite>, the world is a recognisable place: there’s a rich Nigerian kid who larks around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hag-seed-by-margaret-atwood"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2041554"><cite>Hag-Seed</cite>, by Margaret Atwood</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Felix is at the top of his game as Artistic Director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival. His productions have amazed and confounded. Now he’s staging a Tempest like no other: not only will it boost his reputation, it will heal emotional wounds. Or that was the plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Instead, after an act of unforeseen treachery, Felix is living in exile in a backwoods hovel, haunted by memories of his beloved lost daughter, Miranda. And also brewing revenge.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After 12 years, revenge finally arrives in the shape of a theatre course at a nearby prison. Here, Felix and his inmate actors will put on his Tempest and snare the traitors who destroyed him. It’s magic! But will it remake Felix as his enemies fall?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s the summer of 1965, and the streets of Queens, New York shimmer in a heatwave. One July morning, Ruth Malone wakes to find a bedroom window wide open and her two young children missing. After a desperate search, the police make a horrifying discovery. Noting Ruth’s perfectly made-up face and provocative clothing, the empty liquor bottles and love letters that litter her apartment, the detectives leap to convenient conclusions, fuelled by neighbourhood gossip and speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sent to cover the case on his first major assignment, tabloid reporter Pete Wonicke at first can’t help but do the same. But the longer he spends watching Ruth, the more he learns about the darker workings of the police and the press. Soon, Pete begins to doubt everything he thought he knew. Ruth Malone is enthralling, challenging and secretive - is she really capable of murder?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-mare-by-mary-gaitskill"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1985272"><cite>The Mare</cite>, by Mary Gaitskill</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ginger is forty-seven and a recovering alcoholic when she meets and marries Paul. It’s too late for her to have a baby of her own, so she tries to persuade him to consider adoption, but he already has a child and doesn’t share her longing to be a parent. As a compromise, they sign up to an organisation that sends poor inner-city kids to stay with country families for a few weeks in the summer, so one hot July day Velveteen Vargas arrives in their lives, and Ginger is instantly besotted.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-dark-circle-by-linda-grant"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2056452"><cite>The Dark Circle</cite>, by Linda Grant</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Second World War is over, a new decade is beginning but for an East End teenage brother and sister living on the edge of the law, life has been suspended. Sent away to a tuberculosis sanatorium in Kent to learn the way of the patient, they find themselves in the company of army and air force officers, a car salesman, a young university graduate, a mysterious German woman, a member of the aristocracy and an American merchant seaman. They discover that a cure is tantalisingly just out of reach and only by inciting wholesale rebellion can freedom be snatched.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One night in London an 18 year old girl, recently arrived from Ireland to study drama, meets an older actor and a tumultuous relationship ensues. Set across the bedsits and squats of mid-nineties north London, <cite>The Lesser Bohemians</cite> is a story about love and innocence, joy and discovery, the grip of the past and the struggle to be new again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="midwinter-by-fiona-melrose"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2055342"><cite>Midwinter</cite>, by Fiona Melrose</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Father and son, Landyn and Vale Midwinter, are men of the land. Suffolk farmers. Times are hard and they struggle to sustain their property, their livelihood and their heritage in the face of competition from big business.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But an even bigger, more brutal fight is brewing: a fight between each other, about the horrible death of Cecelia, beloved wife and mother, in Zambia ten years earlier. A past they have both refused to confront until now. Over the course of a particularly mauling Suffolk winter, Landyn and Vale grapple with their memories and their pain, raking over what remains of their fragile family unit, constantly at odds and under threat of falling apart forever. While Vale makes increasingly desperate decisions, Landyn retreats, finding solace in the land, his animals - and a fox who haunts the farm and seems to bring with her both comfort and protection.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>Midwinter</cite> is also up for the <a href="/new-suggestions/articles/new-angle-longlist-2017/">2017 New Angle Prize</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sport-of-kings-by-c-e-morgan"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2137175"><cite>The Sport of Kings</cite>, by C. E. Morgan</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hellsmouth, an indomitable thoroughbred filly, runs for the glory of the Forge family, one of Kentucky’s oldest and most powerful dynasties. Henry Forge has partnered with his daughter, Henrietta, in an endeavour of raw obsession: to breed the next superhorse. But when Allmon Shaughnessy, an ambitious young black man, comes to work on their farm after a stint in prison, the violence of the Forges’ history and the exigencies of appetite are brought starkly into view. Entangled by fear, prejudice, and lust, the three tether their personal dreams of glory to the speed and grace of Hellsmouth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A spiralling tale of wealth and poverty, racism and rage, <cite>The Sport of Kings</cite> is an unflinching portrait of lives cast in shadow by the enduring legacy of slavery. A vital new voice, C. E. Morgan has given life to a tale as mythic and fraught as the South itself – a moral epic for our time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-woman-next-door-by-yewande-omotoso"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093156"><cite>The Woman Next Door</cite>, by Yewande Omotoso</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hortensia James and Marion Agostino are neighbours. One is black, one white. Both are successful with impressive careers. Both have recently been widowed. And both are sworn enemies, sharing a hedge and hostility and pruning both with a vim that belies the fact they are over 80.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But one day an unforeseen event forces the women together. And gradually the bickering and sniping softens into lively debate, and from there into memories shared. But could these sparks of connection ever transform into friendship? Or is it too late for these two to change?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-lonely-hearts-hotel-by-heather-oneill"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098956"><cite>The Lonely Hearts Hotel</cite>, by Heather O’Neill</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>The Lonely Hearts Hotel</cite> is a love story with a difference. Set throughout the roaring twenties, it is a wicked fairytale of circus tricks and child prodigies, radical chorus girls, drug-addicted musicians and brooding clowns, set in an underworld whose economy hinges on the price of a kiss.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is the tale of two dreamers, abandoned in an orphanage where they were fated to meet. Here, in the face of cold, hunger and unpredictable beatings, Rose and Pierrot create a world of their own, shielding the spark of their curiosity from those whose jealousy will eventually tear them apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When they meet again, each will have changed, having struggled through the Depression, through what they have done to fill the absence of the other. But their childhood vision remains - a dream to storm the world, a spectacle, an extravaganza that will lift them out of the gutter and onto a glittering stage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-essex-serpent-by-sarah-perry"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079962"><cite>The Essex Serpent</cite>, by Sarah Perry</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Set in Victorian London and an Essex village in the 1890s, and enlivened by the debates on scientific and medical discovery which defined the era, <cite>The Essex Serpent</cite> has at its heart the story of two extraordinary people who fall for each other, but not in the usual way.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They are Cora Seaborne and Will Ransome. Cora is a well-to-do London widow who moves to the Essex parish of Aldwinter, and Will is the local vicar. They meet as their village is engulfed by rumours that the mythical Essex Serpent, once said to roam the marshes claiming human lives, has returned.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you’re wondering where else you’ve seen <cite>The Essex Serpent</cite> on our website recently, it’s also been nominated for the <a href="/health/lists/health-lists/wellcome-longlist/">Wellcome Prize</a>, the <a href="/new-suggestions/articles/walter-scott-longlist/">Walter Scott Prize</a> and the <a href="/new-suggestions/articles/new-angle-longlist-2017/">New Angle Prize</a>.</p>

<h2 id="barkskins-by-annie-proulx"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1972309"><cite>Barkskins</cite>, by Annie Proulx</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the late 17th century two illiterate woodsmen, René Sel and Charles Duquet, make their way from Northern France to New France to seek a living. Bound to a feudal lord, a ‘seigneur’, for three years in exchange for land, they suffer extraordinary hardship, always in awe of the forest they are charged with clearing, sometimes brimming with dreams of its commercial potential. Rene marries an Indian healer, and they have children, mixing the blood of two cultures. Duquet travels the globe and back, starting a logging company that will prosper for generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Proulx tells the stories of the children, grandchildren, and descendants of these two lineages, the Sels and the Duquets, as well as the descendants of their allies and foes, as they travel back to Europe, to China, to New England, always in quest of a livelihood or a fortune, or fleeing stunningly brutal conditions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="first-love-by-gwendoline-riley"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2095691"><cite>First Love</cite>, by Gwendoline Riley</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Neve is a writer in her mid-30s married to an older man, Edwyn. For now they are in a place of relative peace, but their past battles have left scars. As Neve recalls the decisions that led her to this marriage, she tells of other loves and other debts, from her bullying father and her self-involved mother to a musician who played her and a series of lonely flights from place to place. Drawing the reader into the battleground of her relationship, Neve spins a story of helplessness and hostility, an ongoing conflict in which both husband and wife have played a part. But is this, nonetheless, also a story of love?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In Canada in 1991, ten year old Marie and her mother invite a guest into their home. She is Ai-Ming, a young woman from China who has fled following the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square incident. As her relationship with Marie deepens she tells the story of her family in revolutionary China.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-gustav-sonata-by-rose-tremain"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093155"><cite>The Gustav Sonata</cite>, by Rose Tremain</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is the tutor who tells the young Gustav that he must try to be more like a coconut - that he needs a hard shell to protect the softness inside. This is what his native Switzerland has perfected - a shell to protect its neutrality, to keep its people safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But his beloved friend, Anton, doesn’t want to be safe - a gifted pianist, he longs to make his mark on the world outside. On holiday one summer in Davos, the boys stumble across a remote building. Long ago, it was a TB sanitorium; now it is wrecked and derelict. Here, they play a game of life and death, deciding which of their imaginary patients must burn. It becomes their secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><cite>The Gustav Sonata</cite> begins in the 1930s, under the shadow of the Second World War, and follows the boys into maturity, and middle age, where their friendship is tested as never before.”</p>
</blockquote>
