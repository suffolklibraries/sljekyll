<p>Suffolk has a fine literary tradition. It has inspired some of the great literary works of our time, such as W.G. Sebald’s masterpiece <cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite>, and some of the greatest writers, such as George Orwell and P.D. James. It is a county with vibrant literary festivals which attract world-famous speakers and several writers have made their home in the county.</p>

<p>As we celebrate Suffolk Day let’s pause to consider some of the literary riches we have. What follows is not a comprehensive list but it gives a small taste of the diverse range of reading that is available with a Suffolk flavour. How could we forget Beatrix Potter’s links to Melford Hall, Dick Francis’ stories about racing at Newmarket and several fine current writers who are currently writing their own chapter in the county’s literary history?</p>

<h2 id="citethe-rings-of-saturncite-by-w-g-sebaldhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn224777"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=224777"><cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite>, by W. G. Sebald</a></h2>

<p>A fictional record of a journey on foot through coastal East Anglia, Sebald’s home for his last 20 years. It is also an exploration of England’s pastoral and imperial past. Suffolk spotters will soon pick out Covehithe, Lowestoft, Bungay, The Crown Hotel and the Sailors’ Reading Room in Southwold, Boulge Church, Yoxford, the Ruins at Dunwich and the Pagodas of Orford Ness.</p>

<h2 id="citewe-didnt-mean-to-go-to-seacite-by-arthur-ransomehttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn220574"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=220574"><cite>We Didn’t Mean to go to Sea</cite>, by Arthur Ransome</a></h2>

<p>Arthur Ransome’s <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> series is normally associated with the Lake District, but <cite>We Didn’t Mean to Go To Sea</cite>, written in 1937, is set in the area around Pin Mill in the Orwell Estuary.</p>

<h2 id="citeakenfield-portrait-of-an-english-villagecite-by-ronald-blythehttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn122564"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=122564"><cite>Akenfield: Portrait of an English village</cite>, by Ronald Blythe</a></h2>

<p>Classic title written in 1969. This is an account of the changes in agricultural life in Suffolk from the turn of the century to the 1960s.</p>

<h2 id="citea-clergymans-daughtercite-by-george-orwellhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn51511"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=51511"><cite>A Clergyman’s Daughter</cite>, by George Orwell</a></h2>

<p>Orwell did not like Southwold, and the best bits of A Clergyman’s Daughter are a vicious satire on provincial small-town life, including tea rooms. The chief protagonist of the novel, Dorothy Hare, is the dutiful daughter of a rector, and her reputation is destroyed by a malicious gossip.</p>

<p>As a child in Burstall, we know from his correspondence that the young Orwell picked up a large cage rat-trap, which several biographers suggest was the prototype for the cage full of rats in Orwell’s last novel, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=52615"><cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite></a>.</p>

<h2 id="citethe-pickwick-paperscite-by-charles-dickenshttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn1225506"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1225506"><cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>, by Charles Dickens</a></h2>

<p>Charles Dickens visited Suffolk in 1836 as a correspondent reporting the General Election. The corruption he witnessed first hand in Sudbury and Ipswich became the basis for the Eatanswill election in <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1859 he gave a public reading in the Corn Exchange in Ipswich which was formerly Lloyds Bank. He also stayed at the Angel Hotel in Bury which he mentioned in <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="citeorlando-the-marmalade-cat-a-seaside-holidaycite-by-kathleen-halehttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn1513076"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1513076"><cite>Orlando the Marmalade Cat: a seaside holiday</cite>, by Kathleen Hale</a></h2>

<p>Aldeburgh’s most famous visitor, Orlando the Marmalade Cat brought his wife and children on holiday to ‘Owlbarrow’ in 1952.</p>

<h2 id="citeno-namecite-by-wilkie-collinshttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn20626"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=20626"><cite>No Name</cite>, by Wilkie Collins</a></h2>

<p>Wilkie Collins’ sensational and compelling novel explores the themes of illegitimacy and inheritance in Victorian society. The heroine pursues her persecutor to ‘the quaint little watering-place’ Aldborough (then in Suffolk). She stays in the White Lion hotel and observes the comings and goings of the villa residents.</p>

<h2 id="citethe-bookshopcite-by-penelope-fitzgeraldhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn41832"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=41832"><cite>The Bookshop</cite>, by Penelope Fitzgerald</a></h2>

<p>Although she was born in Lincoln, Penelope Fitzgerald had several links with Suffolk. Described as ‘the quiet genius of British fiction’, Fitzgerald did not publish her first book until her 60th year and did not become famous until she was 80.</p>

<p>In 1979 Fitzgerald was the unlikely winner of the Booker Prize for her novel <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=94841"><cite>Offshore</cite></a>. At the time of her death in 2000, she had published three biographies and nine novels, been nominated twice more for the Booker Prize, and earned widespread admiration for her unique, controlled style.</p>

<p>Her novel <cite>The Bookshop</cite> was inspired by Fitzgerald’s own life working in a bookshop in Southwold. It is about a woman, Florence, who opens a bookshop in the fictional town of Hardborough, and it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.</p>

<h2 id="citea-suspension-of-mercycite-by-patricia-highsmithhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn1593744"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1593744"><cite>A Suspension of Mercy</cite>, by Patricia Highsmith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sydney Bartleby has killed his wife, Alicia - at least he has thought about it, compulsively, over and over again, plotting schemes, designing escapes, forging alibis. Of course he has; he’s a mystery-script writer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when Alicia takes a long, unannounced vacation, Sydney seizes the opportunity to perfect his artistic method. With her characteristic precision and unrivalled sensitivity to the inner tremblings of human character, Patricia Highsmith shockingly portrays Sydney’s descent into the treacherous world of his own fictions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patricia Highsmith wrote this novel while she was living in Suffolk, first in Aldeburgh, then in Bridge Cottage in Earl Soham.</p>

<h2 id="citethe-crime-writercite-by-jill-dawsonhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn2098880"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098880"><cite>The Crime Writer</cite>, by Jill Dawson</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In 1964, the eccentric American novelist Patricia Highsmith is hiding out in a cottage in Suffolk, to concentrate on her writing and escape her fans. She has another motive too - a secret romance with a married lover based in London. Unfortunately it soon becomes clear that all her demons have come with her. Prowlers, sexual obsessives, frauds, imposters, suicides and murderers: the tropes of her fictions clamour for her attention, rudely intruding on her peaceful Suffolk retreat. After the arrival of Ginny, an enigmatic young journalist bent on interviewing her, events take a catastrophic turn.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>The Crime Writer</cite> is on the shortlist for the <a href="/new-suggestions/articles/new-angle-longlist-2017/">2017 New Angle Prize</a>, which celebrates literature associated with or influenced by East Anglia.</p>

<h2 id="citecomplete-ghost-storiescite-by-m-r-jameshttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn398979"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=398979"><cite>Complete Ghost Stories</cite>, by M. R. James</a></h2>

<p>‘A Warning to the Curious’ is set in Aldeburgh, which is called Seaburgh in the story.</p>

<h2 id="citemr-mac-and-mecite-by-esther-freudhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn1645540"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1645540"><cite>Mr Mac and Me</cite>, by Esther Freud</a></h2>

<p>Set in Walberswick, Esther Freud’s novel tells the story of the local inn-keeper’s boy, Thomas Maggs, who finds an escape from his chaotic family life in the company of two summer visitors from Glasgow. The pair, renowned architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret MacDonald, encourage Thomas’ budding artistic talent and an unlikely friendship develops.</p>

<h2 id="citedaughters-in-lawcite-by-joanna-trollopehttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn52289"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=52289"><cite>Daughters-in-Law</cite>, by Joanna Trollope</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rachel has always loved being at the centre of her large family. She has fiercely devoted herself to her three sons all their lives, and continues to do so even now they are all grown up. They are, of course, devoted to her also. But when Luke, her youngest, gets married, Rachel finds that control is slipping away.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is set on the Suffolk coast.</p>

<h2 id="citei-capture-the-castlecite-by-dodie-smithhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn2006878"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2006878"><cite>I Capture the Castle</cite>, by Dodie Smith</a></h2>

<p>Set in a dilapidated castle in Suffolk, probably in Wingfield, this is the journal of Cassandra Mortmain. First, there is her eccentric father. Then there is her sister, Rose - and her stepmother, Topaz. Finally, there is Stephen, who is in love with Cassandra. Cassandra records her feelings on all of them. Who can forget the opening with Cassandra sitting with her feet in the kitchen sink?</p>

<h2 id="citeunder-an-english-heavencite-by-robert-radcliffehttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn15138"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=15138"><cite>Under an English Heaven</cite>, by Robert Radcliffe</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is 1943. The sleepy Suffolk village of Bedenham is jerked into the twentieth century and the harsh realities of war by the arrival on its doorstep of an American bomber base and its 3,000 inhabitants.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="citethe-digcite-by-john-prestonhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn285408"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=285408"><cite>The Dig</cite>, by John Preston</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Extraordinarily skillfully written and almost unbearably tense, Julie Myerson’s tale of murder in a small Suffolk seaside town includes all of the features of a murder mystery. However the book is really about the effect of the murder on a community and how relationships begin to crumble and unravel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="citedeath-in-holy-orderscite-by-p-d-jameshttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn1551417"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1551417"><cite>Death in Holy Orders</cite>, by P. D. James</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Plucky and headstrong Mildred Holland revelled in the eight years she and her husband, the vicar William Holland, spent travelling 1840s Europe, finding inspiration in recording beautiful artistic treasures and collecting exotic artifacts. But William’s new posting in a tiny Suffolk village is a world apart and Mildred finds a life of tea and sympathy dull and stifling in comparison. When a longed-for baby does not arrive, she sinks into despondency and despair. What options exist for a clever, creative woman in such a cosseted environment?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book was inspired by the true story of the real Mildred Holland and the parish church of Huntingfield.</p>

Tom is helpless and alone until he meets Moll Cutpurse, a thirteen-year-old pickpocket. Together they find themselves chased across the city by the murderous Ratsey. But it’s only on the first night of a new play - The Devil and his Boy - that Tom realises that the fate of the Queen and indeed the entire country rests in his hands.”</p>
</blockquote>
