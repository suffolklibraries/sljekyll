<p>Suffolk has a fine literary tradition. It has inspired some of the great literary works of our time, such as W.G. Sebald’s masterpiece <cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite>, and some of the greatest writers, such as George Orwell and P.D. James. It is a county with vibrant literary festivals which attract world-famous speakers and several writers have made their home in the county.</p>

<p>As we celebrate the third Suffolk Day, let us consider some of the literary riches we have. What follows is not a comprehensive list, but it gives a small taste of the diverse range of reading that is available with a Suffolk flavour.</p>

<h2 id="we-didnt-mean-to-go-to-sea-by-arthur-ransome"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=220574"><cite>We Didn’t Mean to go to Sea</cite>, by Arthur Ransome</a></h2>

<p>Arthur Ransome’s Swallows and Amazons series, normally associated with the Lake District, sets <cite>We Didn’t Mean to Go To Sea</cite>, written in 1937, on the Shotley Peninsula.</p>

<h2 id="akenfield-portrait-of-an-english-village-by-ronald-blythe"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=122564"><cite>Akenfield: Portrait of an English village</cite>, by Ronald Blythe</a></h2>

<p>Writer Ronald Blythe was born in Acton, Suffolk. He wrote the classic <cite>Akenfield</cite> in 1969, which is an account of the changes in agricultural life in Suffolk from the turn of the century to the 1960s.</p>

<h2 id="a-clergymans-daughter-by-george-orwell"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=51511"><cite>A Clergyman’s Daughter</cite>, by George Orwell</a></h2>

<p>Orwell did not like Southwold, and the best bits of A Clergyman’s Daughter are a vicious satire on provincial small-town life, including tea rooms. The chief protagonist of the novel, Dorothy Hare, is the dutiful daughter of a rector, and her reputation is destroyed by a malicious gossip.</p>

<p>As a child in Burstall, we know from his correspondence that the young Orwell picked up a large cage rat-trap, which several biographers suggest was the prototype for the cage full of rats in Orwell’s last novel, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=52615"><cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite></a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-pickwick-papers-by-charles-dickens"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1225506"><cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>, by Charles Dickens</a></h2>

<p>Charles Dickens visited Suffolk in 1836 as a correspondent reporting the General Election. The corruption he witnessed first hand in Sudbury and Ipswich became the basis for the Eatanswill election in <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1859 he gave a public reading in the Corn Exchange in Ipswich which was formerly Lloyds Bank. He also stayed at the Angel Hotel in Bury which he mentioned in <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="the-rings-of-saturn-by-w-g-sebald--michael-hulse-trans"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2558710"><cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite>, by W. G. Sebald &amp; Michael Hulse (trans.)</a></h2>

<p>A fictional record of a journey on foot through coastal East Anglia, Sebald’s home for his last 20 years. It is also an exploration of England’s pastoral and imperial past. Suffolk spotters will soon pick out Covehithe, Lowestoft, Bungay, The Crown Hotel and the Sailors’ Reading Room in Southwold, Boulge Church, Yoxford, the Ruins at Dunwich and the Pagodas of Orford Ness.</p>

<h2 id="orlando-the-marmalade-cat-a-seaside-holiday-by-kathleen-hale"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1513076"><cite>Orlando the Marmalade Cat: a seaside holiday</cite>, by Kathleen Hale</a></h2>

<p>Aldeburgh’s most famous visitor, Orlando the Marmalade Cat brought his wife and children on holiday to ‘Owlbarrow’ in 1952.</p>

<h2 id="no-name-by-wilkie-collins"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=20626"><cite>No Name</cite>, by Wilkie Collins</a></h2>

<p>Wilkie Collins’ sensational and compelling novel explores the themes of illegitimacy and inheritance in Victorian society. The heroine pursues her persecutor to ‘the quaint little watering-place’ Aldborough (then in Suffolk). She stays in the White Lion hotel and observes the comings and goings of the villa residents.</p>

<h2 id="the-bookshop-by-penelope-fitzgerald"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=41832"><cite>The Bookshop</cite>, by Penelope Fitzgerald</a></h2>

<p>Although she was born in Lincoln, Penelope Fitzgerald had several links with Suffolk. Described as ‘the quiet genius of British fiction’, Fitzgerald did not publish her first book until her 60th year and did not become famous until she was 80.</p>

<p>In 1979 Fitzgerald was the unlikely winner of the Booker Prize for her novel <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=94841"><cite>Offshore</cite></a>. At the time of her death in 2000, she had published three biographies and nine novels, been nominated twice more for the Booker Prize, and earned widespread admiration for her unique, controlled style.</p>

<p>Her novel <cite>The Bookshop</cite> was inspired by Fitzgerald’s own life working in a bookshop in Southwold. It is about a woman, Florence, who opens a bookshop in the fictional town of Hardborough, and it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.</p>

<h2 id="a-suspension-of-mercy-by-patricia-highsmith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1593744"><cite>A Suspension of Mercy</cite>, by Patricia Highsmith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sydney Bartleby has killed his wife, Alicia - at least he has thought about it, compulsively, over and over again, plotting schemes, designing escapes, forging alibis. Of course he has; he’s a mystery-script writer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when Alicia takes a long, unannounced vacation, Sydney seizes the opportunity to perfect his artistic method. With her characteristic precision and unrivalled sensitivity to the inner tremblings of human character, Patricia Highsmith shockingly portrays Sydney’s descent into the treacherous world of his own fictions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patricia Highsmith wrote this novel while she was living in Suffolk, first in Aldeburgh, then in Bridge Cottage in Earl Soham.</p>

<h2 id="complete-ghost-stories-by-m-r-james"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=398979"><cite>Complete Ghost Stories</cite>, by M. R. James</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rachel has always loved being at the centre of her large family. She has fiercely devoted herself to her three sons all their lives, and continues to do so even now they are all grown up. They are, of course, devoted to her also. But when Luke, her youngest, gets married, Rachel finds that control is slipping away.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is set on the Suffolk coast.</p>

<h2 id="i-capture-the-castle-by-dodie-smith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2006878"><cite>I Capture the Castle</cite>, by Dodie Smith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Extraordinarily skillfully written and almost unbearably tense, Julie Myerson’s tale of murder in a small Suffolk seaside town includes all of the features of a murder mystery. However the book is really about the effect of the murder on a community and how relationships begin to crumble and unravel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="death-in-holy-orders-by-p-d-james"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1551417"><cite>Death in Holy Orders</cite>, by P. D. James</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The autumn of 1933 is the most beautiful Edie Mather can remember.
