<blockquote>
  <p>“On March 3, 1947, in the maternity ward of Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, Archibald Isaac Ferguson, the one and only child of Rose and Stanley Ferguson, is born.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From that single beginning, Ferguson’s life will take four simultaneous and independent fictional paths. Four Fergusons made of the same genetic material, four boys who are the same boy, will go on to lead four parallel and entirely different lives. Family fortunes diverge. Loves and friendships and intellectual passions contrast.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Chapter by chapter, the rotating narratives evolve into an elaborate dance of inner worlds enfolded within the outer forces of history as, one by one, the intimate plot of each Ferguson’s story rushes on across the tumultuous and fractured terrain of mid twentieth-century America.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Having signed up for the US army in the 1850s, aged barely 17, Thomas McNulty and his brother-in-arms, John Cole, go on to fight in the Indian wars and, ultimately, the Civil War. Orphans of terrible hardships themselves, they find these days to be vivid and alive, despite the horrors they both see and are complicit in.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>Days Without End</cite> won the 2016 Costa Prize and the <a href="/new-suggestions/articles/walter-scott-longlist/">2017 Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-wolves-by-emily-fridlund"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2098935"><cite>History of Wolves</cite>, by Emily Fridlund</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Linda has an idiosyncratic home life: her parents live in abandoned commune cabins in northern Minnesota and are hanging on to the last vestiges of a faded counter-culture world. The kids at school call her ‘Freak’, or ‘Commie’. She is an outsider in all things. Her understanding of the world comes from her observations at school, where her teacher is accused of possessing child pornography, and from watching the seemingly ordinary life of a family she babysits for.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yet while the accusation against the teacher is perhaps more innocent than it seemed at first, the ordinary family turns out to be more complicated. As Linda insinuates her way into the family’s orbit, she realises they are hiding something. If she tells the truth, she will lose the normal family life she is beginning to enjoy with them; and if she doesn’t, a life is at stake.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="exit-west-by-mohsin-hamid"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108914"><cite>Exit West</cite>, by Mohsin Hamid</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war, Saeed and Nadia share a cup of coffee, and their story begins. It will be a love story but also a story about war and a world in crisis, about how we live now and how we might live tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Before too long, the time will come for Nadia and Saeed to leave their homeland. When the streets are no longer useable and all options are exhausted, this young couple will join the great outpouring of those fleeing a collapsing city, hoping against hope, looking for their place in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="solar-bones-by-mike-mccormack"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2014005"><cite>Solar Bones</cite>, by Mike McCormack</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Once a year, on All Souls’ Day, it is said in Ireland that the dead may return. <cite>Solar Bones</cite> is the story of one such visit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Marcus Conway, a middle-aged engineer, turns up one afternoon at his kitchen table and considers the events that took him away and then brought him home again. Funny and strange, McCormack’s ambitious and other-worldly novel plays with form and defies convention.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reservoir-13-by-jon-mcgregor"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2126767"><cite>Reservoir 13</cite>, by Jon McGregor</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Midwinter in the early years of this century. A teenage girl on holiday has gone missing in the hills at the heart of England. The villagers are called up to join the search, fanning out across the moors as the police set up roadblocks and a crowd of news reporters descends on their usually quiet home.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Meanwhile, there is work that must still be done: cows milked, fences repaired, stone cut, pints poured, beds made, sermons written, a pantomime rehearsed. The search for the missing girl goes on, but so does everyday life. As it must.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="elmet-by-fiona-mozley"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2271644"><cite>Elmet</cite>, by Fiona Mozley</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Daniel is heading north. He is looking for someone. The simplicity of his early life with Daddy and Cathy has turned sour and fearful. They lived apart in the house that Daddy built for them with his bare hands. They foraged and hunted. When they were younger, Daniel and Cathy had gone to school.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But they were not like the other children then, and they were even less like them now. Sometimes Daddy disappeared, and would return with a rage in his eyes. But when he was at home he was at peace. He told them that the little copse in Elmet was theirs alone. But that wasn’t true. Local men, greedy and watchful, began to circle like vultures. All the while, the terrible violence in Daddy grew.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-ministry-of-utmost-happiness-by-arundhati-roy"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2156480"><cite>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</cite>, by Arundhati Roy</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</cite> takes us on a journey of many years, the story spooling outwards from the cramped neighbourhoods of Old Delhi into the burgeoning new metropolis and beyond, to the Valley of Kashmir and the forests of Central India, where war is peace and peace is war, and where, from time to time, ‘normalcy’ is declared.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Anjum, who used to be Aftab, unrolls a threadbare carpet in a city graveyard that she calls home. A baby appears quite suddenly on a pavement, a little after midnight, in a crib of litter. The enigmatic S. Tilottama is as much of a presence as she is an absence in the lives of the three men who loved her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</cite> is at once an aching love story and a decisive remonstration. It is told in a whisper, in a shout, through tears and sometimes with a laugh. Its heroes are people who have been broken by the world they live in and then rescued, mended by love and by hope. For this reason, they are as steely as they are fragile, and they never surrender.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lincoln-in-the-bardo-by-george-saunders"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2115917"><cite>Lincoln in the Bardo</cite>, by George Saunders</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The American Civil War rages while President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son lies gravely ill. In a matter of days, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From this seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of realism, entering a thrilling, supernatural domain both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself trapped in a transitional realm - called, in Tibetan tradition, the bardo - and as ghosts mingle, squabble, gripe and commiserate, and stony tendrils creep towards the boy, a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="home-fire-by-kamila-shamsie"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2203819"><cite>Home Fire</cite>, by Kamila Shamsie</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Isma is free. After years spent raising her twin siblings in the wake of their mother’s death, she is finally studying in America, resuming a dream long deferred. But she can’t stop worrying about Aneeka, her beautiful, headstrong sister back in London - or their brother, Parvaiz, who’s disappeared in pursuit of his own dream: to prove himself to the dark legacy of the jihadist father he never knew.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then Eamonn enters the sisters’ lives. Handsome and privileged, he inhabits a London worlds away from theirs. As the son of a powerful British Muslim politician, Eamonn has his own birthright to live up to - or defy. Is he to be a chance at love?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="autumn-by-ali-smith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2016062"><cite>Autumn</cite>, by Ali Smith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Daniel is a century old. Elisabeth, born in 1984, has her eye on the future. The United Kingdom is in pieces, divided by a historic once-in-a-generation summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Love is won, love is lost. Hope is hand in hand with hopelessness. The seasons roll round, as ever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="swing-time-by-zadie-smith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2057070"><cite>Swing Time</cite>, by Zadie Smith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Two girls dream of being dancers - but only one, Tracey, has talent. The other has ideas: about rhythm and time, about black bodies and black music, what constitutes a tribe, or makes a person truly free. It’s a close but complicated childhood friendship that ends abruptly in their early twenties, never to be revisited, but never quite forgotten, either.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2055317"><cite>The Underground Railroad</cite>, by Colson Whitehead</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. All the slaves lead a hellish existence, but Cora has it worse than most; she is an outcast even among her fellow Africans and she is approaching womanhood, where it is clear even greater pain awaits.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Caesar, a slave recently arrived from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they take the perilous decision to escape to the North. In Whitehead’s razor-sharp imagining of the antebellum South, the Underground Railroad has assumed a physical form: a dilapidated box car pulled along subterranean tracks by a steam locomotive, picking up fugitives wherever it can.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But its placid surface masks an infernal scheme designed for its unknowing black inhabitants.”</p>
</blockquote>
