</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fifty years on from England’s World Cup victory, football great Sir Bobby Charlton takes us back to the greatest moment of his life: what he saw, what he heard, how he felt as the lynchpin attacking midfielder in England’s winning team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="lost-league-football-grounds-by-ken-coton--martin-plumb"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2179690"><cite>Lost League Football Grounds</cite>, by Ken Coton &amp; Martin Plumb</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Football is a national passion that inspires nostalgia and friendships.

</blockquote>

<h3 id="ipswich-town-a-history-by-susan-gardiner"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1469916"><cite>Ipswich Town: a history</cite>, by Susan Gardiner</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thirteen very different Ipswich Town supporters write about their favourite game. From the sublime, when Ipswich beat Bolton in the 2000 play-off semi-finals to a near riot at Millwall in 1978, and including classic games against Norwich and Sheffield United, this book shows how it’s not our greatest victories as a football club that stay in our hearts, but other values, less tangible than silverware: love, family, friendship &amp; sport.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ipswich-town-champions-196162-by-martin-brooks"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=245913"><cite>Ipswich Town: champions 1961/62</cite>, by Martin Brooks</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ipswich Town’s league championship success in 1961/62 was one of the greatest shocks in the history of professional football in England. This is the story of that season in a match-by-match account set against the background of the news stories of the day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="got-not-got-the-lost-world-of-ipswich-town-by-derek-hammond--gary-silke"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1822254"><cite>Got, Not Got: the lost world of Ipswich Town</cite>, by Derek Hammond &amp; Gary Silke</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This volume is an Aladdin’s cave of memories and memorabilia, guaranteed to whisk you back to Portman Road’s fondly remembered ‘Golden Age’ of mud and magic - as well as a Blues-mad childhood of miniature tabletop games and imaginary, comic-fuelled worlds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The book recalls a more innocent era of football, lingering longingly over relics from the good old days - Tractor Boys stickers and petrol freebies, league ladders, big-match programmes and much more - revisiting lost football culture, treasures and pleasures that are 100% Ipswich Town. If you are a lifelong Ipswich fan, one of the army of obsessive soccer kids at any time from the arrival of Bobby Robson to the early days of the Premier League, then this is the book to recall the mavericks - Mariner, Muhren and Mills, Holland, Beattie and Butcher - the the marvels of the lost world of football.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ipswich-town---the-1978-fa-cup-story-by-mel-henderson"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=898112"><cite>Ipswich Town - The 1978 FA Cup Story</cite>, by Mel Henderson</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book looks back on the 1978 FA Cup campaign that culminated in Bobby Robson’s team defeating Arsenal 1-0 to become FA Cup winners. All the details of Ipswich’s road to Wembley are featured in this book, including a round-by-round review and full, detailed biographies of every player to have taken part in the campaign.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This title features hundreds of photographs of Ipswich Town in action during the 1960s. It spans the era from Alf Ramsey’s League Championship triumph in 1961/62 to the beginning of the Bobby Robson years in 1969.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="got-not-got-the-lost-world-of-norwich-city-by-derek-hammond--gary-silke"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1824061"><cite>Got, Not Got: the lost world of Norwich City</cite>, by Derek Hammond &amp; Gary Silke</a></h3>

<h3 id="a-life-in-speedway-by-john-louis"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2019620"><cite>A Life in Speedway</cite>, by John Louis</a></h3>
