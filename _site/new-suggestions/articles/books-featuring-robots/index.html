<p>To mark the opening of <a href="https://beta.sciencemuseum.org.uk/robots/">the Science Museum’s major new <cite>Robots</cite> exhibition</a>, as well as the beginning of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08fg08m">Radio 4 series <cite>The Rise of the Robots</cite></a>, we’ve picked out a selection of great books for all ages that feature robots.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why they’re called ‘robots’? Czech playwright Karel Čapek coined the word from the Czech verb ‘robota’, ‘to work’.</p>

<p>This list was compiled with the help of Lakenheath Library manager Chris Howard and information and content librarian Lisa Brennan.</p>

The Petbots realise he has downloaded a virus, and it’s up to Flo, Sparky and their new human friends to work out a cure before Archie shuts down for good!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 3 titles in the Petbots series, and 3 robots who star in them all: Archie the cat, Sparky the mouse and Flo the bird. Their chaotic adventures are the perfect read for children moving on from short chapters to slightly longer reads. This is the second title in the series.</p>

<p>After the mysterious disappearance of her inventor father, Lily travels to London to uncover the truth. Featuring life-like clockwork animals called “mechanicals”, a cast of well-drawn characters and faux Victorian steampunk inventions galore, this is a brilliant read. It’s a corker of a book, a rip-roaring adventure and we hope someone makes it into a film.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Eleven-year-old Olly has a very special delivery - a 3D printing machine, stamped with PROPERTY OF M.O.D and BRITISH SPACE AGENCY. WARNING. DO NOT TAMPER, which has magical powers. It has a name, it speaks, and it can print ANYTHING Olly asks it to - a never-ending supply of sweets, a swimming pool in the shed - but what Olly really wants is his dad, who has separated from his mum and moved out of the family home. Cue the creation of Dad-Bot - he looks just like Dad (on a good day) but is totally chaotic - and his antics tip Olly and co into a heart-racing and heart-warming adventure!”</p>

<p>Published in 1967, this classic allegorical tale about mechanical toys tells of their struggles through a hostile world and their quest to become self-winding. It features some memorable characters such as Manny Rat, the ruthless amoral villain, a fortunetelling frog who preys on the gullible and a troupe of travelling rooks called The Caws of Art. If you haven’t come across it before, give it a try but don’t be deluded by the gentle cover. It’s quite a read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After a few early glitches in their relationship, Sammy and his ‘bro-bot’ E are now best friends. In fact, E is such a valued member of the family that the other electronic members of the House of Robots are feeling sorely unappreciated. And when Sammy’s inventor mum becomes distracted by a top-secret project, the robots soon begin to fall into disrepair.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cue a robot revolt, with the droids wreaking harmless havoc in the house! Armed with pranks like glue in the shampoo bottles and flying toast missiles, the robots demand to be cared for. It’s up to Sammy and his disabled sister Maddie to keep the peace until his mum reveals her secret project and why it was worth the wait.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Astra’s ship is in trouble. There’s something very sinister lurking in the canteen. A cakey monstrosity on the war path. And then there’s the Poglites - a space salvage crew who have invaded the ship in their quest for spoonage! Astra and her robot friend Pilbeam are the only things standing in the way of the ship’s destruction!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Frank is a kid genius who loves figuring out how the world works by creating household contraptions that are part science, part imagination, and definitely unusual. After an uneventful experiment with a garage-lab artificially intelligent RoboBug, a lightning storm, and a flash of electricity, Frank’s inventions - the robots Klink and Klank - suddenly come to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Not exactly the ideal lab partners, the wise-cracking Klink and the overly expressive Klank are a help nonetheless as Frank attempts to perfect his Dark Energy Drive - that is until Frank’s arch nemesis, T. Edison, steals Klink and Klank for his evil doomsday plan!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Determined to liberate the mass-produced but highly intelligent robots forged in the machinery of Rossum’s island factory, Helena Gory arrives in a blaze of righteousness. Soon perplexed by the robots’ seeming humanity but lack of sentience, she deserts her strident campaigning and falls in love with Domin, the factory’s general manager.”</p>

  <p>“The women of Stepford are not all that they seem.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Written when Mary Shelley was only 19 years old, this chilling tale of a young scientist’s desire to create life still resonates today. Victor Frankenstein’s monster is stitched together from the stolen limbs of the dead, and the result is a grotesque being who, rejected by his maker, sets out on a journey to wreak his revenge. In the most famous gothic horror story ever told, Shelley confronts the limitations of science, the nature of human cruelty and the pathway to forgiveness with rich language and evocative imagery.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making ‘good jobs’ obsolete: many paralegals, doctors, and ironically even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots. As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer jobs will be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In terms of societal and economic upheaval, this is most important technological shift since the industrial revolution. And, unless we radically reassess the fundamentals of how our economy and politics work, we risk a future of massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the economy itself. Martin Ford offers both an exploration of this new technology and a call to arms to face its implications.”</p>

By some estimates, the ‘Internet of Everything’ will explode into a $19 trillion market in just a few years. If that happens, when that happens, it will transform your life.

Michael Miller reveals how a new generation of autonomously connected smart devices is emerging, and how it will enable people and devices to do more things, more intelligently, and more rapidly.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the most exciting challenges faced by Leonardo was to create robots made to resemble human or animal, or rather automatic self-operating devices. The technological excellence achieved during the XV century and the impetus in Mechanics and Engineering developed in Leonardo a growing interest in humanoid automata and in self-operating machines that still interests many scholars today. Many researchers share the hypothesis that Leonardo studied automata and attempted to sketch some projects on his manuscripts. In fact, pulleys and gears are the real ‘stars’ of the famous folio 216v-b [579r] in the Codex Atlanticus, associated with the project of the automaton or robot. Due to the lack of a main project, this drawing leaves some pending questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This project was the result of the research carried out by the artist in the field of anatomy, studies partially lost and partially recorded in the Codex Huygens, kept at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Therefore Leonardo traced the idea of a sort of Robotics, a so-called anathomia artificialis: studying the human body, he came to the creation of a wonderful humanised machine. The artist-craftsman could not receive a higher consecration. Leonardo’s automata are the subject of this book, which collects the results presented by scholars that have studied Leonardo from different points of view.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dr George Zarkadakis traces artificial intelligence or AI’s origins in ancient myth, through literary classics such as Frankenstein, to today’s sci-fi blockbusters, arguing that a fascination with AI is hardwired into the human psyche. He explains AI’s history, technology and potential; its manifestations in intelligent machines; its connections to neurology and consciousness, as well as - perhaps most tellingly - what AI reveals about us as human beings.”</p>

  <p>“Sci-fi drama series set in an alternate future where families use lifelike androids, known as synths, as their robotic house servants. In suburban London, Joe Hawkins (Tom Goodman-Hill) purchases a new synth, that his children name Anita (Gemma Chan), to replace his oft-absent wife Laura (Katherine Parkinson). But when she returns to find her husband’s new purchase, Laura begins to feel threatened by the synthetic human and worryingly suspects that synths may be capable of experiencing human emotions.</p>
