Come along to our launch event to find out more about the new weekly library for peninsula residents. Staff will be on hand to answer questions and can sign you up for a library card to borrow books.

There will also be a story and song session from toddlers from 2:15-2:45pm, and Easter craft activities for children of all ages from 1-4pm.
