                <p>Evidence suggests that children who read for enjoyment every day not only perform better in reading tests than those who don’t, but also develop a broader vocabulary, increased general knowledge and a better understanding of other cultures.</p>

<p>In fact, there’s evidence to suggest that reading for pleasure is more likely to determine whether a child does well at school than their social or economic background.</p>

<p>You may not be reading with your child as you did at primary school but there are many ways to encourage your child to engage with and enjoy reading. Here are just a few:</p>

<p><strong>Read yourself</strong>. This is the most important thing you can do. Read in front of them so they can see you in action. Make sure that they see you reading often. Speak positively about books. Read to your children – they are never too old. Make sure there is a reading culture in your home with books, newspapers, magazines, etc all available in every room (yes that includes the toilet). Buy books (ask which titles they would like) or book vouchers for presents. Normalise reading in the everyday life of your family.</p>

<p><strong>Take them to your local library</strong>. This is key. We are not just saying this to promote ourselves. Libraries offer books selected by qualified librarians in a safe environment. Libraries offer printed books, audio books, eBooks and eMagazines. All for free. Allow your child to browse and pick books themselves. If they are struggling to decide – just ask a librarian or check out a specially created book list for inspiration. Libraries have many free activities for all age groups. And whilst you are there, pick up a book (or twenty) for yourself to enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Talk to your child about what they are reading</strong>. Don’t ask them to write a 1000 word review on the new Tom Gates book. That would not be cool.  Ask them what is happening in the book. Are they enjoying it? Is it scary, funny or boring? Do any of the characters remind them of friends and family? If they have questions about the book then email or tweet the author. Most authors are lovely people who like positive feedback from their readers (they might just take a while to respond). Talk about what books you read as a child.</p>
