    <p><em>Sometimes the stuff your parsnips tell you should be taken with a grot big pinch of salt.</em></p>

<p>Sophie Nieuwenleven is a 14 year old pigeon. ‘Nieuwenleven’ is a new noodle given to Sophie by her mambo and her don (Sophie’s parsnips) when they suddenly start a new life in Belgium. Sophie attends the local international spook, whilst her dad fixes carbuncles in his garbage and her mambo stays in the apocalypse with her bruiser who’s called Hercule. When Sophie gets a lettuce from the Helixtorturer of her spook, things come to a helix for the family.</p>

<p>How is your ‘helix’ coping with the story so far? Confused? Intrigued?! This is how Hayley Long plays with worms and language throughout the fabulous story of <cite>Sophie Someone</cite>. It will all totally make sense really quickly, and will put a great big smile on your face! For example: Teachers are torturers, a phoenix is what you use to text your friends and when things get too much you put your helix in your hashtags and hope everything will somehow sort itself out.</p>

<p>At the start of the book you will have loads of questions: Why did Sophie’s family move to Brussels and change their name? Why is her mambo scared to leave the house? Why does Sophie use worms in the way she does? You will have to read the book to find out.</p>

<p>Author Hayley Long was born in Ipswich and grew up in Felixstowe. She now lives in Norwich (but we don’t hold that against her!). <cite>Sophie Someone</cite> is a clever mystery tale (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18867093">based on the true story of a family from Felixstowe</a>) that has quite rightly been shortlisted for the 2015 <a href="http://www.costa.co.uk/costa-book-awards/costa-book-awards/">Costa Children’s Book Award</a>.</p>

<p>We asked Hayley Long to go Beyond the Book for us by answering our quibbles.<figure></figure></p>

<h3 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h3>

<p>I’m in my house in Norwich.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today">How many words have you written today?</h3>

<p>Hm, I’m not sure. I’ve been putting the finishing touches on an essay actually. As well as writing fiction, I’m currently doing a part-time MA in American Literature at the <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/">UEA</a>. I’m in my second year. It’s been really good. It gets me out of my house and thinking about reading books that I wouldn’t normally choose to read.</p>

<h3 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h3>

<p>You want a shelfie, I’ll give you a shelfie!<figure></figure></p>

<p>But to narrow those down to what needs reading, this is a picture of all the books I’ve acquired recently and which I’d like to read at some point.<figure></figure></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-266x150.jpg" alt="Hayley Long Bookshelf 2" />&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>This is easy. I’d join the characters in Enid Blyton’s <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19966414?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(312066)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20magic%20faraway%20tree"><cite>The Magic Faraway Tree</cite></a>. I read this book when I was about seven or eight and I’ve never forgotten it. It’s about this odd bunch of people (not necessarily human people) who live in a big tree.</p>

<p>There’s Silkie who is a fairy and Mr Moonface who is this guy with a big round head and Mr Saucepan who is a strange old man covered in saucepans. And each one of them has their very own neat and cosy little tree-house. At the top of the tree is a cloud and you can climb through the cloud up a ladder until you come to a new world. The world is different everyday. Sometimes it’s a good world like the Land-of-Take-What-You-Want and sometimes it’s a terrible place – except I don’t remember any specific details about the bad places.</p>

<p>Anyway, in answer to your question, I’d go and live in that tree. I wouldn’t change anything that happens — I’d just live there. It would be so perfect.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h3>

<p>In 2115, I can tell you that e-readers are a funny little gadget you sometimes find at hovercar boot sales. A lot of people still have one hidden away in the space-pod for novelty value but nobody other than real retro-fans of the early 21st century actually use them as their preferred way to read. Things changed, you see. At some point, I think it was as far back as the year 2025, people got bored of staring at screens all the time and reading everything from screens and doing all their chatting via computer screens and only ever thinking about everything in 140 characters or fewer and eventually there was a revolution. It was the Cultural Revolution of 2030 in fact. You probably learned about it in intergalactic school.</p>

<p>Anyway, people wanted <em>real</em> things again. Real experiences, real human contact and real books. And now books have never been more popular. The book industry is one of the biggest provider of jobs in the galaxy; people work as booksellers, librarians, editors, writers, publishers… all sorts! And to think, it looked like we might lose all that at one stage in preference for a free dodgy download! Last month, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books were republished in a very limited edition with luxury velvet covers. And each page of all seven books was handwritten and decorated by Trappist monks. Those books are quite something.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars.

This one book tells you all you need to know about Earth. It tells you that it’s often a difficult, unfair and upsetting world that we live in BUT there are some beautiful and good people in it.</p>

Published by Hot Key Books, for ages 11+, 258 pages.</p>

<p>Hayley has a wonderful <a href="http://www.hayleylong.org/">website</a>, [<em>Sometimes the stuff your parsnips tell you should be taken with a grot big pinch of salt.</em></p>

<p>Sophie Nieuwenleven is a 14 year old pigeon. ‘Nieuwenleven’ is a new noodle given to Sophie by her mambo and her don (Sophie’s parsnips) when they suddenly start a new life in Belgium. Sophie attends the local international spook, whilst her dad fixes carbuncles in his garbage and her mambo stays in the apocalypse with her bruiser who’s called Hercule. When Sophie gets a lettuce from the Helixtorturer of her spook, things come to a helix for the family.</p>

<p>How is your ‘helix’ coping with the story so far? Confused? Intrigued?! This is how Hayley Long plays with worms and language throughout the fabulous story of <cite>Sophie Someone</cite>. It will all totally make sense really quickly, and will put a great big smile on your face! For example: Teachers are torturers, a phoenix is what you use to text your friends and when things get too much you put your helix in your hashtags and hope everything will somehow sort itself out.</p>

<p>At the start of the book you will have loads of questions: Why did Sophie’s family move to Brussels and change their name? Why is her mambo scared to leave the house? Why does Sophie use worms in the way she does? You will have to read the book to find out.</p>

<p>Author Hayley Long was born in Ipswich and grew up in Felixstowe. She now lives in Norwich (but we don’t hold that against her!). <cite>Sophie Someone</cite> is a clever mystery tale (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18867093">based on the true story of a family from Felixstowe</a>) that has quite rightly been shortlisted for the 2015 <a href="http://www.costa.co.uk/costa-book-awards/costa-book-awards/">Costa Children’s Book Award</a>.</p>

<p>We asked Hayley Long to go Beyond the Book for us by answering our quibbles.<figure></figure></p>

<h3 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today-3">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h3>

<p>I’m in my house in Norwich.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today-3">How many words have you written today?</h3>

<p>Hm, I’m not sure. I’ve been putting the finishing touches on an essay actually. As well as writing fiction, I’m currently doing a part-time MA in American Literature at the <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/">UEA</a>. I’m in my second year. It’s been really good. It gets me out of my house and thinking about reading books that I wouldn’t normally choose to read.</p>

<h3 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible-3">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h3>

<p>You want a shelfie, I’ll give you a shelfie!<figure></figure></p>

<p>But to narrow those down to what needs reading, this is a picture of all the books I’ve acquired recently and which I’d like to read at some point.<figure></figure></p>

<h3 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot-3">If you could be transported into the plot of any book, which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h3>

<p>This is easy. I’d join the characters in Enid Blyton’s <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19966414?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(312066)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20magic%20faraway%20tree"><cite>The Magic Faraway Tree</cite></a>. I read this book when I was about seven or eight and I’ve never forgotten it. It’s about this odd bunch of people (not necessarily human people) who live in a big tree.</p>

<p>There’s Silkie who is a fairy and Mr Moonface who is this guy with a big round head and Mr Saucepan who is a strange old man covered in saucepans. And each one of them has their very own neat and cosy little tree-house. At the top of the tree is a cloud and you can climb through the cloud up a ladder until you come to a new world. The world is different everyday. Sometimes it’s a good world like the Land-of-Take-What-You-Want and sometimes it’s a terrible place – except I don’t remember any specific details about the bad places.</p>

<p>Anyway, in answer to your question, I’d go and live in that tree. I wouldn’t change anything that happens — I’d just live there. It would be so perfect.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like-3">It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h3>

<p>In 2115, I can tell you that e-readers are a funny little gadget you sometimes find at hovercar boot sales. A lot of people still have one hidden away in the space-pod for novelty value but nobody other than real retro-fans of the early 21st century actually use them as their preferred way to read. Things changed, you see. At some point, I think it was as far back as the year 2025, people got bored of staring at screens all the time and reading everything from screens and doing all their chatting via computer screens and only ever thinking about everything in 140 characters or fewer and eventually there was a revolution. It was the Cultural Revolution of 2030 in fact. You probably learned about it in intergalactic school.</p>

<p>Anyway, people wanted <em>real</em> things again. Real experiences, real human contact and real books. And now books have never been more popular. The book industry is one of the biggest provider of jobs in the galaxy; people work as booksellers, librarians, editors, writers, publishers… all sorts! And to think, it looked like we might lose all that at one stage in preference for a free dodgy download! Last month, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books were republished in a very limited edition with luxury velvet covers. And each page of all seven books was handwritten and decorated by Trappist monks. Those books are quite something.</p>
