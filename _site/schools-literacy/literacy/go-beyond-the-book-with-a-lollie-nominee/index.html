        <p>I love funny books, who doesn’t? And the latest whirlwind adventure starring the lovable <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23683393?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(45860399)&amp;QRYTEXT=Fitzgerald%2C%20Ruth%2C%20author">Emily Sparkes</a> is most definitely a very funny book. Welcome to <em><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23726505?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(45624747)&amp;QRYTEXT=Emily%20Sparkes%20and%20the%20friendship%20fiasco">Emily Sparkes and the Friendship Fiasco</a></em> by Ruth Fitzgerald!</p>

<p>Eleven year old Emily is having a tough old time thanks to the arrival of a new baby sister that has thrown the Sparkes’ home into chaos. Weeks after her birth this new sister is still without a name and Grandma has convinced Emily that this oversight will result in some serious jail time for both parents. Added to this is the shocking news that her best friend has moved to a whole new country – Wales! Emily simply can’t decide who to choose as her new best friend, but it’s definitely not going to be the annoying Zuzanna or Gross-Out Gavin. The arrival of super snobby Chloe Clarke, a disastrous school trip and the worst mobile phone ever isn’t going to make Emily’s life any easier…</p>

<p>Having worked in a school I must mention the spot on descriptions of teachers and school life as seen through the eyes of Emily:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our school has a new policy – homework every night. This is because we have a new head teacher, Mr Meakin, who is completely strict. Before Mr Meakin we had Head Teacher Vacancy. This means they couldn’t find anyone to be in charge so the teachers were allowed to run a bit wild… Mr Meakin is the sort of head teacher who is always popping up in unexpected places trying to catch the teachers out for smiling too much or drinking tea in the classroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also an excruciatingly funny description of a school trip to a mock Tudor village that left me in stitches. Will Emily make a new best friend? Will her new baby sister end up being called Yoda? Grab a copy of <em>Emily Sparkes and the Friendship Fiasco</em> and I guarantee that you will smile, grin, chuckle, snort, guffaw, belly laugh and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>It came as no surprise to us at Suffolk Libraries when Ruth was <a href="http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/lollies">shortlisted for 2016 ‘Laugh out Loud’ awards</a> (known as the Lollies) for <em>Emily Sparkes and the Friendship Fiasco</em>. If your school is taking part in the voting process then vote for this book!</p>

Find out where she writes her books, the wonderful names of her chickens and why she would send a teenage diary to Mars! We will also be sending someone round to collect her library fines…</p>

<p>You should also pop over to her <a href="http://www.ruthfitzgerald.co.uk/">website</a> to download a bookmark and try her funny wordsearch.</p>

It’s only just got warm enough to start using it.</p>

<p>Every spring I have to clear out all the old barbeques, garden chairs and flower pots which have been stuffed in there over the winter but once it’s organised it’s heaven. Quiet, peaceful and the best thing is I can’t get a broadband signal so I have to concentrate on writing and not on Facebook!</p>

Fi-fi, Winnie, Peg, Gill and Miranda (all named by my daughters) at the end of the garden.</p>

<p>They keep escaping from their run and going round the garden eating the plants!</p>

<p>Errr… next question</p>

<h3 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h3>

<p><a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3602.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-55887"><img class="alignright" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3602-200x150.jpg" alt="Pictue of a book shelf with children's books on it" /></a>I have so many books I want to read – I could sit in the house and just read for a year and still have a pile next to my bed! At the moment I’m reading the other books on the Laugh Out Loud Awards shortlist – they are all so brilliantly funny!</p>

<p>I also always have a massive stack of library books because I can’t stop myself taking out as many as I’m allowed. Trouble is I’m not very good at getting them back on time. I’m thinking of setting up a direct debit to pay my library fines!!</p>

<h3 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot">If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h3>

<p>I always wanted be <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23684351?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50629)&amp;QRYTEXT=Pippi%20Longstocking">Pippi Longstocking</a>. She was like a superhero to me when I was young. She’s super strong and has no one to tell her what to do and she always says exactly what she thinks – in fact I’d love to be like her even now! I wouldn’t try to change what happens but I would love it if there were more Pippi adventures – perhaps I’ll write some!</p>

<h3 id="imagine-it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">Imagine it is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h3>

<p>Maybe I’m being old fashioned but I don’t really see the point in changing books. They do the job perfectly! They’re light and portable and easy to hold in one hand and if you drop them in the bath they still work (after a bit of time on the radiator). Having said that, I do love my Kindle, which I use for kind of testing out books I’m not sure I want to buy – then if I like them, I buy them anyway! In 2115 I think books will still be around but they’ll have to be made out of waterproof paper – because there probably won’t be radiators anymore!</p>

<h3 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h3>

<p><a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-55886"><img class="alignleft" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-113x150.jpg" alt="picture of 3 children's books" /></a>Well, I suppose you could send great, learned works about politics and war and religion, but I think for most people and especially children, life is about the smaller things, family, school and ‘When can we go to Nando’s again?’ So, I would send a book about what it’s really like to be a young person.</p>

<p>Also, I think it should be funny because all human children love laughing and the aliens need to know this. One of my favourites is ‘<a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23685090?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(94223)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20secret%20diary%20of%20Adrian%20Mole%20aged%2013%203%2F4">The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 ¾</a>’ by Sue Townsend, although it’s quite old now so it probably wouldn’t give a very accurate picture of modern life. Or we could send one of the Georgia Nicholson books by <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23686457?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(167017)&amp;QRYTEXT=Rennison%2C%20Louise">Louise Rennison</a>, or Clarice Bean books by <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23687192?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(151295)&amp;QRYTEXT=Child%2C%20Lauren">Lauren Child</a>. These all make me laugh my socks off because they’re so ‘real’ – and ‘real’ life is very funny isn’t it?!</p>
