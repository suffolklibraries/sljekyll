                    <blockquote>
  <p>Frank looked down at his plate. The vegetables, once perhaps an appetising and inviting shade of green, had been boiled to the point of translucency. The potatoes were dust grey and dry like masonry rubble. There was a piece of indeterminate meat that looked as though it had been pickled in formaldehyde for a century or two. He stabbed it with his fork and it deflated flatulently.</p>

  <p>‘I’m not hungry,’ he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so begins <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3429213?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53434734)&amp;QRYTEXT=Anything%20that%20isn%27t%20this"><cite>Anything that isn’t this</cite></a> by Chris Priestley. And what an opening! The language is sublime and paints a vivid picture. My mouth went dry at the description of the potatoes and then we get to the meat deflating ‘flatulently’. Flatulently! Has meat ever been described like this! The superb language continues throughout the 400+ pages of the book which are also beautifully  illustrated by the author. When you get your hands on a copy just wait for the joy of chapter 6 where Frank visits his grandfather at the cemetery for a chat.</p>

<p>The story is set in a grey town that has had the life sucked out of it by the ‘Ministry’. Citizens are kept in line through misinformation and propaganda in ways more frightening than even Orwell’s <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3443000?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(14342)&amp;QRYTEXT=Nineteen%20eighty-four"><cite>1984</cite></a>. The town remains under a strict curfew for unknown reasons and families are watched over by secretive students who jot down everything they see for the Ministry to inspect.</p>

<p>Frank tries to fight back against the grey that seeps into every nook and cranny of his life through his creative writing. But the destructive grey smog swallows up all in its path and all too soon Frank ends up working for the sinister Mr Vertex at the Ministry with catastrophic results.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, Chris Priestley forces us to look into a mirror and question what influences our own lives. It is a modern day masterpiece that will force readers to consider media control, the power of the state, surveillance of citizens and the value and power of art and culture.<figure></figure></p>

<p><cite>Anything that isn’t this</cite> is a terrifying book that should be read by everyone. It was my favourite book of 2015 and was given by me to my secret Santa. I lent my copy of Priestley’s <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3430005?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(42388073)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20last%20of%20the%20spirits"><cite>Last of the Spirits</cite></a> to my Dad over Christmas and he is keen to read more. I think he is going to love <cite>Anything that isn’t this</cite>.</p>

<p>We asked Chris Priestley to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and answer a few questions about his life as an author.</p>

<h3 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h3>

<p>I’m in Cambridge.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-see-from-your-window-please-send-a-picture-or-drawing-if-possible">What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</h3>

<p>Although I don’t have any pics, I can see my back yard and the bird feeder. I can see some of the neighbours gardens too. I’m working at home at the moment.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today-be-honest">How many words have you written today? (be honest!)</h3>

<p>I honestly don’t know – 2000 or thereabouts.</p>

<h3 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h3>

<p>Don’t have a shelf. I’m dipping in and out of various books. <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3430501?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(509661)&amp;QRYTEXT=Mythago%20wood"><cite>Mythago Wood</cite></a> – Robert Holdstock and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3431003?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(14024886)&amp;QRYTEXT=Holloway"><cite>Holloway</cite></a> – Robert McFarlane.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot">If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h3>

<p>Goodness. I don’t know. Most plots are full of drama that I might want to avoid were I a character. But I can’t think of any book where I’d like to be part of the plot. I’d love to walk through that wardrobe into Narnia though.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h3>

<p>I have absolutely no idea. neither does anyone else.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h3>

<p>The complete works of Shakespeare. Everything is in there.<figure></figure></p>
