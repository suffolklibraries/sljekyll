<p><a href="https://www.place2be.org.uk/our-story/childrens-mental-health-week/">Children’s Mental Health Week</a> starts on the 8 February and the theme for this year is ‘building resilience’ and teaching children to ‘bounce forward’ from life’s challenges. Organisers <a href="https://www.place2be.org.uk/">Place2Be</a> comment that “while we cannot always change children’s circumstances, we can teach them the skills to cope with the difficulties life throws at them.”</p>

<p>I would like to look at two ways that libraries and reading can support the mental well-being of children.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stocking and promoting fiction that features some of the issues experienced by young people</li>
  <li>Pointing young people towards books that are enjoyable and lift the mood</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="books-about-issues-where-to-start">Books about issues: Where to start?</h2>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/mind-your-head.jpg" alt="Mind your head by Juno Dawson" /></p>

<p>I would start with one author keen to make a difference; the wonderful <a href="http://www.junodawson.com/about/">Juno Dawson</a>. Juno writes multi award-winning teen fiction and important non-fiction and has recently released <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22850281?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57962502)&amp;QRYTEXT=Mind%20your%20head"><cite>Mind Your Head</cite></a>; a brilliant book that discusses mental health and young people. The book is very accessible and supportive, with some powerful real-life stories from young people around the world. <cite>Mind Your Head</cite> covers topics such as anxiety and depression, self-harm and personality disorders; perfect for young people, parents and teachers.</p>

<p>Juno has also compiled a fantastic list of books for young adults that feature strong minority characters or that discuss important teen issues. The list was in response to <a href="https://twitter.com/diversebooks">#WeNeedDiverseBooks</a>, and Juno explains that she writes diverse YA books to reduce feelings of isolation and to raise awareness of minority or marginalised characters in the wider community.</p>

<p><img class="fr pl3" src="/images/article/juno-dawson-large.jpg" alt="Picture of author Juno Dawson" /></p>

<p>Juno’s <a href="http://www.junodawson.com/2015/06/28/yougotdiversebooks/">#WeNeedDiverseBooks list</a> is split into the categories including mental illness, trans, LGBQ+, POC characters, YA books that discuss feminism, and disabilities. There are nearly 150 books on the list covering a range of authors, styles and age groups.</p>

<p>Last week a new report arrived in my inbox. Produced by Galaxy Quick Reads, <cite><a href="http://readingagency.org.uk/news/GALAXY%20Quick%20Reads%20Report%202016%20FINAL.pdf">The Untold Power of the Book</a></cite> discusses a study into the reading attitudes of 2000 adults and contains the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a world that often values perfection, books can be a way to ground readers in what is true and real. A third of people in our survey agreed that society puts pressure on people to be perfect, and reading can be an antidote to this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst I think the word ‘perfect’ is clunky and ‘antidote’ a little over the top, I do believe that books can help to alleviate feelings of isolation for all age groups. Children and young people might just need pointing in the right direction to find them.</p>

<h2 id="books-thatlift-the-mood">Books that lift the mood?</h2>

<p>Interestingly, one of the people interviewed in Juno’s <cite>Mind Your Head</cite> is quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I turned to books mostly for help. Not just ‘issue’ books that dealt with the things I was going through but other happier books that allowed me to escape from my own problems. (page 49, Mind Your Head)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Books are often linked with escapism, but can they help in other ways? Can they really make you feel happier? And which books have the power to do this?</p>

<p>In 2009 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5070874/Reading-can-help-reduce-stress.html">the Telegraph newspaper reported on research</a> conducted by Mindlab International showing that reading can reduce stress levels by 67%. Cognitive neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis had observed that people only needed to read silently for six minutes to slow down the heart rate and ease tension in their muscles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>None of the other activities in the trial could beat reading for relieving stress, with listening to music reducing the levels by 61 per cent, having a cup of tea of coffee by 54 per cent and taking a walk by 42 per cent. Playing video games brought them down by 21 per cent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study shows that reading might have the ability to alleviate physical symptoms of stress in some people. We have no knowledge of what kind of texts were read, but what if you could both relieve stress and read some great books to make you happier? The <a href="http://reading-well.org.uk/about">Reading Agency</a> has a suggestion…</p>

<h2 id="mood-boosting-books">Mood-Boosting Books</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://readingagency.org.uk/adults/quick-guides/mood-boosting-books/">Mood-Boosting Books</a> scheme from The Reading Agency is a national promotion of uplifting titles, including novels, poetry and non-fiction. The great thing about the scheme is that the books are all recommended by readers and reading groups and updated every couple of years. These are books that other people have had a positive experience when reading. Maybe it could work for you or someone you know.</p>

<p>A new list for young people is currently being prepared and will be released in April 2016. The most up to date list can be seen below, along with links to reserve the books from Suffolk Libraries where available. It would also be interesting to ask young people in schools to come up with their own alternative list.</p>

<p>In 2012, young people in reading groups chose the following <a href="http://readingagency.org.uk/adults/quick-guides/mood-boosting-books/">Mood-Boosting Books</a>:</p>
