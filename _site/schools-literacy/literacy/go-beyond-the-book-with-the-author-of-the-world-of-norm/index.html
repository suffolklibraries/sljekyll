                    <p>In my previous life as a school librarian I never had the chance to read any of the <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24046409?QRY=SEBIB%3C%20IRN(6071865)&amp;QRYTEXT=World%20of%20Norm"><cite>Norm</cite></a> books. In fact it was rare to see one for months at a time they were so popular. Eventually I would be presented with a pile of scruffy bits of paper that must have once looked like a book. The pages would be dog-eared and damp with tears of laughter from the many children who had read it. And with that the book had reached the end of its natural life and was ‘retired’, with great reverence, to the library in the sky, and a new copy bought.<figure></figure></p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/jm_tour_teaser-132x150.jpg" alt="Picture of author Jonathan Meres" />&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the other month when I saw author Jonathan Meres taking part in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukmgchat&amp;src=typd">#ukmgchat</a> on twitter that I realised now was my chance to read one! That and the fact that during the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukmgchat&amp;src=typd">#ukmgchat</a> they were discussing the literary merits of toilet humour in middle grade books. Naturally I was professionally required, nay obliged, to investigate this possible depravity.</p>

<p>I got my hands on <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24045802?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9299010)&amp;QRYTEXT=May%20cause%20irritation.%20%5BPaperback%5D"><cite>The World of Norm: May Cause Irritation</cite></a>. This is the second of the <cite>Norm</cite> books and begins with Norm finding himself standing totally naked in a supermarket before being arrested by a talking dog. Luckily for Norm this is just a dream! But it’s a great introduction to the crazy life of Norm and his daily struggle to grow up in a world that so clearly is out to get him. Norm has to deal with trying to outshine his perfect cousins, outwit his devious siblings, live with the most embarrassing mobile phone ever and put up with a new dog that gets more attention than him. Can Norm hatch a cunning plan to come out on top? What does he stand to gain by shaving a dog?!</p>

<p>I can see why young people love the Norm books as they are such flipping fun to read. Young people love them for the humour and because they deal with issues around growing up and finding your place in the world. There are also brilliant illustrations by Donough O’Malley throughout the book that bring the characters and situations to life.</p>

<p>We asked Jonathan Meres to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us. He said yes AND provided up with our first piece of original artwork!</p>

<h3 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h3>

<p>55 degrees &amp; 55 minutes North, 3 degrees &amp; 10 mins west. Roughly.</p>
