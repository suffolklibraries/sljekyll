    <p>I don’t know where to start with this review. How can I put into words the zany plot, the fantastical characters and even begin to describe the screwball situations in <cite>Boyface and the Tartan Badger</cite>? But I need to write something that will hopefully persuade you to grab a copy of this book, read it and then tell everyone you know how brilliant it is. Because this is a cracking book. Are you ready? Then I will begin.<figure></figure></p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/91MB1nijAUL._SL1500_-195x300.jpg" alt="Boyface and the tartan badger" />&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p><cite>Boyface and the Tartan Badger</cite> is set in the mysterious town of Stoddenage-on-Sea. If I have read the supplied map correctly then Stoddenage-on-Sea is down the road from Bahoumanoomaland. Boyface Antelope lives with his parents in a house in Stoddenage-on-Sea that contains a Quantum Chromatic Disruption Machine, a red telephone box used as a fish tank and a tartan badger. So far, so strange.</p>

<p>A tartan badger is the worst pet in the world due the fact that it bites your feet, poos in your underwear draw and only eats artichokes. Despite these terrible character flaws, when an evil clown steals the tartan badger Boyface decides to rise to the challenge and rescue his despised pet. He is assisted by Clootie who wears a saucepan on her head and a psychic cafe owner skilled in Patisseomancy – which is the art of fortunetelling by reading scones. That’s scones as in what you have as part of a cream tea. Are you still with me…</p>

<p>In all seriousness <cite>Boyface and the Tartan Badger</cite> is a superb book. James Campbell is a skilled writer who takes you on a wonderful journey that is, believe it or not, perfectly convincing and so, so much fun. At the heart of the book is a tale of friendship, family bonds, revenge and scones that will leave your sides aching and your brain fizzing.</p>

<p>I was lucky to meet James last month and asked him to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us. He agreed to do so only if I bought him a sausage sandwich. Thankfully they were out of tartan bread and badger meat.</p>

<h2 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h2>

<p>I’m at the breakfast table surrounded by the remains of Weetos and unfinished homework. I have just taught my middle child how to use compasses and am now trying to do all my emails before 9am so I can spend the day writing and watching videos about mountain climbing.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-see-from-your-window-please-send-a-picture-or-drawing-if-possible">What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</h2>

<p>From the dining room window the view isn’t very interesting. But I have attached the view from my office window which is my front garden.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today-be-honest">How many words have you written today? (be honest!)</h2>

<p>None. I haven’t started yet. But I’m going to mainly be editing today so I’ll probably be writing a negative number of words.</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h2>

<p>There’s a Chris Priestley on the shelf in the loo. By my bed is a book about Celtic solstice lines and by the bath is a book on what to do with babies.<figure></figure></p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot">If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h2>

<p>I’d like to go into <em><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12320671?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(8958)&amp;QRYTEXT=My%20name%20is%20Mina">My Name is Mina</a></em> by David Almond and spend some time with Mina in her tree. I wouldn’t change anything – just watch and listen.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h2>

<p>I think more people are writing their own books, having them printed and sharing them with their friends. It’ll be a bit like what is happening with videos and YouTube. Everyone is a film maker today. Everyone is a photographer. Wouldn’t it be great if everyone was a writer?</p>

<h2 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h2>

<p>Shakespeare seems to cover everything there is about being human. You could send a book about what life is like here today but it would be out of date very quickly. Shakespeare will always be relevant.</p>

<p>Thanks James!</p>
