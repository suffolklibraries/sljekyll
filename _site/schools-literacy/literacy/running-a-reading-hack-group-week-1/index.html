                    <p><img src="/images/featured/featured-reading-hack-week-1.jpg" alt="Reading Hack Group - Week 1" /></p>

<p>We launched our very first <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/">Reading Hack</a> group on 13 April 2016 at the wonderful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BecclesLibrarySuffolk/">Beccles Library</a> with some eager year 7 pupils from a nearby school as part of their enrichment program</p>

<p>I thought it might be useful to blog about how we are running the group, and the activities we are putting on, for those thinking of starting their own Reading Hack group.</p>

<h2 id="about-reading-hack">About Reading Hack</h2>

<p>Reading Hack is a mix of advocacy, volunteering, competitions and fun activities linked to reading. The activities (called Hacks) involve using technology, art, storytelling, etc. to engage and inspire young people. Young people upload their hacks to the website for other hackers to try and earn online badges. You can find out more on the <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/about">Reading Hack website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="planning-for-the-group">Planning for the group</h2>

<p>I have decided that for the first few weeks I will prepare a menu of activities for attendees to choose from before the Hackers start planning their own. The activities will have a greater impact when <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/toolkits">planned and delivered</a> by the young people themselves, and the group will run without me after the six week enrichment period is over.</p>

<h2 id="session-1">Session 1</h2>

<p>We began with an ice-breaker activity looking at the books we were currently reading, our favourite literary characters and favourite ever books before moving on to look at what Reading Hack is.</p>

<p>I demonstrated the Reading Hack website and my profile (including my avatar with grey hair!) and asked for everyone to go away and create their own profile and to join our group by the next session. I also distributed a letter for parents/carers with some brief info and Reading Hack and a photo permission slip.</p>

<p>We had to name our group! I displayed what some other Reading Hack groups were called and suggested that the name Beccles could be included and handed it over to the group. I thought that this would be a massive discussion and take ages to decide but one girl suggested the Beccles Book Bunnies and the others all agreed. I later went away and <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/groups/23">created the group online</a> which was really easy to do.</p>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/bookface-the-passage.jpg" alt="The Passage bookface" /></p>

<p>Next I displayed some ‘get caught reading’ and #bookface images from the internet as an idea for a hack. Hackers thought this looked fun and we combined creatingour own #bookface images with a library tour by Ellen the library manager. This worked well because we could look for suitable books in each section of the library. The results were great as you can see!</p>

<p>We finished the session with a quick game of <a href="http://shop.winningmoves.co.uk/products/top-trumps---all-packs/5036905022897-top-trumps-harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban.html">Harry Potter Top Trumps</a> and decided that it might be fun to make some of our own literary Top Trumps at some point. In session 2 next week the hackers decided that they would like to do some storytelling activities and create a logo for our group.</p>

<h2 id="hints-and-tips">Hints and tips</h2>

<p>Set up your own account on the Reading Hack website in advance. You need this to set up a group.
Have some quick example activities up your sleeve. Top Trumps are great for this.</p>

<p><img class="fr pl3" src="/images/article/bookface-bears.jpg" alt="Bears bookface" /></p>

<p>We did the #bookface activity because the faces of the young people would be obscured and this made them comfortable to take part. We tweeted them including the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BookFace?src=hash">#bookface</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReadingHack?src=hash">#readinghack</a> hashtags plus <a href="https://twitter.com/ReadingHackers">@ReadingHackers</a> and our own twitter accounts. These were then retweeted and liked as far afield as Leeds!</p>

<p>Animal books have some great front covers for bookfaces!</p>

<h2 id="what-i-would-do-differently">What I would do differently</h2>

<p>Have computers ready for hackers to go online and create their profile straight away.</p>
