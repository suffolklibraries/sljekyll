                    <p>Do you have a pet? A budgie, gerbil or cat maybe? How about a cow? Would you fancy having a cow living in your back yard? Could you hide it from the farmer, the police and local press? This is what happens in <cite>Cowgirl</cite> when a load of cows from a nearby farm are destined for the slaughterhouse. Can Gemma and her neighbours save the day? And what will Gemma learn from the whole experience?</p>

<p>In the video below author Giancarlo Gemin reads from <cite>Cowgirl</cite> and gives some background to his book.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p><cite>Cowgirl</cite> is a wonderful book. For a start it looks visually stunning as every page is decorated with flowers and cow print. Secondly, it is very, very, funny with some fabulous characters such as Kate the cowgirl who lifts truanting boys onto her back and carries them off to school, Gemma’s Gran who takes in the first cow and hides it in her tiny back yard and Gemma’s naughty brother Darren who loves to wind Gemma up. Finally, it tells the story of a community coming together in the most unexpected way.</p>

<p>The book is set in Wales and the dialogue between the characters is wonderfully Welsh with Gemma remarking that things are fab’lous and ridic’lous (trying saying them out loud). We think that it would be a brilliantly uplifting TV series or – as Giancarlo pointed out – a great moo-vie!</p>

<p>Author Giancarlo Gemin won the annual Tir na n-Og Award for this debut novel and his second book, <cite><a href="http://nosycrow.com/product/sweet-pizza/">Sweet Pizza</a></cite>, is out in May 2016!</p>

<p>We asked Giancarlo to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and answer a few questions about his life as an author.</p>

<p>**Hello there, where in the world are you today?</p>

<p>** I’m in Brixton, south London.</p>

<p>**What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</p>

<p>** It’s raining and I’m watching people hurrying by, under their umbrellas. Sorry I’m a technophobe and don’t even have a smart phone to send a photo.</p>

<p>**How many words have you written today? (be honest!)</p>

<p>** Only the amount of words it’s taken to reply to this email! I’m not a prolific writer, sadly. I don’t write every day, it’s an activity that I find causes me more frustration than enjoyment (you said to be honest). A lot of children’s writers produce a book a year, but I put a lot in my stories and it takes longer. Between <cite>Cowgirl</cite> and <cite>Sweet Pizza</cite> it’ll be over two years.</p>

<p>**What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</p>

<p>** As I said, my books are in boxes but I want to read Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite>, which I’ve never read. It’s all about a man who sells his soul to the devil to be young again.</p>

<p>**If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</p>

<p>** I love John Steinbeck and I’d like to be transported into <cite>Of Mice and Men</cite>. Yes, I would try and persuade George not to do what he does to Lennie at the end – of course, I would not have my writer’s hat on when I do this.</p>

<p>**It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</p>

<p>** Books will be available in a device that’s bolted to your head and when you reach the end of the book you will be given free access to see the film of the book, but not before you’ve read it – the device knows if you’ve read the book so you can’t cheat.</p>

<p>**We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</p>

<p>** <cite>A Fortunate Life</cite> by A. B. Facey – an autobiography that shows the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. Alternatively, and this is egotistical of me, we could send <cite>Cowgirl</cite>, as it will show the aliens how humans behave kindly and not so kindly, but ultimately they can change for the better.</p>

<p>Thanks for going ‘Beyond the Book’ Giancarlo!<figure></figure></p>
