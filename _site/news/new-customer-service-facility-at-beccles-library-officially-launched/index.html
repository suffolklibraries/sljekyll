<p>Waveney District Council’s new Customer Services facility at <a href="/branches/beccles-library/" title="Beccles Library">Beccles Library</a> has had its official launch.</p>

<p>The library now hosts a Waveney District Council customer desk and a private interview area has now been completed which, in due course, will also host housing information and benefits surgeries, as well as being available to other community groups.</p>

<p>By vacating the Market Street offices and sharing with the library, the council is able to save money and the library can offer more services under one roof. The new venue also offers customers the benefit of ample, nearby parking (free for short periods), is close to public transport routes and is totally accessible for those with disabilities. The new arrangement is also helping to attract new visitors to the library which now also offers free Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Cllr Frank Mortimer, Waveney’s Cabinet Member for Customers and Communities said: “Council officers, our property partners NPS and our new colleagues at Suffolk Libraries have worked tirelessly to deliver the relocation project and I am very grateful to all of them for their hard work and dedication. We have received positive feedback from customers and staff alike and look forward to developing our relationship for the benefits of our customers and communities.”</p>

<p>Tony Brown is Chairman of Beccles Library Community Trust and also Chair of Suffolk Libraries Board. He said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Waveney District Council. The library is already providing a highly valued service, and this collaboration will encourage even more people from the local community to visit the library and discover what it has to offer.”</p>

<p>Maggie Ross, Manager of Beccles Library, said: “There has definitely been an increase in the number of people visiting the library as a result of the new shared service. People are commenting that it’s a nice place to visit for their council enquiries and useful to have these services under one roof. One lady with a council query was impressed that she was then able to sign up as a new library user to access our free internet to pay her gas bill online. The library and council staff teams are also working well together too.”</p>
