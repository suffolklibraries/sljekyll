                    <div class="entry-content">

                        <p>This Thursday (3 March) is World Book Day and Suffolk Libraries is marking the date by launching a competition to encourage people to get involved with its Year of Reading campaign.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries is looking for the best ‘Get Caught Reading’ and ‘Bookface’ photos.</p>

<p>The idea of Get Caught Reading is to have your photo taken reading a book in a funny or unusual place and Bookface is a great way of being creative with the cover of a book and strategically holding a book with a face on the cover in front of your own.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries is offering a prize of £50 of shopping vouchers to the best entry under both categories. The deadline is Friday 27 May and entries can be sent to <strong>reading@suffolklibraries.co.uk</strong> or tweeted to <a href="https://twitter.com/suffolklibrary">@SuffolkLibrary</a>.</p>

<p>The only rules are the photos must be original, they must come from Suffolk residents and you must make sure you do not put yourself at risk whilst taking the photos.</p>

<p>2016 is the 21st World Book Day. Established by UNESCO in 1995, it’s a celebration of books and publishing. There are various events taking place across the country and libraries have also been helping to distribute £1 World Book Day tokens to children which can be swapped for a special WBD book or used towards the purchase of a full-price book.</p>

<p>Once children have their World Book Day voucher they will also be able to swap it for the special World Book Day books or buy one for £1 from participating bookshops and supermarkets.</p>

<p>The following libraries are also running special events (all on Thursday except Chantry and Halesworth):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwold Library are welcoming children from Southwold Primary School and the Rosebuds Preschool. Children are being encourage to visit the library in fancy dress and Library Manager Charlotte Clark is also dressing as Spot the Dog. She will also be making an appearance at Reydon Primary’s school assembly. The children will be taking part in a special World Book Day picture competition, drawing a character and working with older kids to come up with a children’s story.</li>
  <li>Chantry Library are running their World Book Day activity on Wednesday (2 March). From 1pm to 5pm children under eight can enjoy story sessions at 1pm, 2.30pm and 4pm with crafts, games and refreshments between each session.</li>
  <li>Gainsborough Library are holding fun book themed activities all day from 11am to 5pm beginning with storytime and craft activities for younger children and more activities after school for older children. Children are encouraged to come dressed as their favourite book character.</li>
  <li>Hadleigh Library are holding special story time and craft activities for younger children from 2pm to 3pm.</li>
  <li>Halesworth Library’s regular Sunday craft activity this week (6 March) will also have a special World Book Day theme where children can make a special book box from 12noon to 2.30pm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suffolk Libraries recently launched its Year of Reading Campaign to celebrate and promote reading throughout the county in 2016. For more information visit <a href="http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/reading">www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/reading</a>.</p>
