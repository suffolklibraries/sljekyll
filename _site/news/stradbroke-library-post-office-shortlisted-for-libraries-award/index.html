                <h1 class="custom-lh-title f2 pa0 ma0 mb3

                <p>Suffolk Libraries has been shortlisted for a national libraries award for the new post office in Stradbroke Library.</p>

<p>The Stradbroke Library post office, launched in October 2014, has been named as one of two finalists for the ‘Social’ category in the EDGE library conference awards which are held in Edinburgh in early March.</p>

<p>EDGE is one of the country’s leading conferences for public library and information professionals and aims to share good practice and discuss future developments. There are three categories – Social, Digital and Community.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries won the ‘Digital’ category at the 2014 EDGE Conference for its Get Connected programme to inform customers about online library services and was also shortlisted in 2013 for the Club 4 Teenz youth group at Gainsborough Library in Ipswich.</p>

<p>The Stradbroke Library project is thought to be the first example of a library service taking on the responsibility of running a post office.</p>

<p>The original village post office closed two years ago and the village shop closed soon after. During this period Stradbroke had no post office, shop or means of cash withdrawals without a journey of at least four miles with very limited access to public transport.</p>

<p>The post office has already been a huge success, prompting a change in opening hours to include a post office collection on Mondays. Monthly visits to the library have increased from just under 1,000 in 2013/14 to an average of about 2,700 per month for the current financial year so far.</p>

<p>The rise in visits is also leading to greater use of library services. Library issues increased by over 1,100 in 2015 and there was also an increase in people registering as library customers. The post office has also helped to provide additional income and means that Suffolk Libraries is now able to sell postage stamps from all the county’s libraries.</p>

<p>The project was a result of Suffolk Libraries working in partnership with the Stradbroke Courthouse and Library Trust (SCALT) and it received great support from Post Office Ltd.</p>

<p>Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re thrilled that the Post Office in Stradbroke Library has been recognised by being named as a finalist at these awards. The library manager put a great deal of hard work into making it happen, with support from colleagues at Suffolk Libraries, SCALT and other organisations. It really is a good news story for the whole community as the post office has helped us to provide even more relevant and popular services for local residents, increase library use and also generate additional income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maureen John, Stradbroke Library Manager, added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted we’re one of the finalists for this award and with how successful the post office has been. At one end of the counter we stamp books and at the other we sell books of stamps! Having the Post Office in the library helps us to provide an extra public service to a potentially isolated rural community and it’s a lifeline for many older people. It’s also helped to trigger new developments at Stradbroke Courthouse including refurbishment, a new community café and regular themed evening meals in the café for local people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a recent Suffolk Libraries customer survey, there were several individual comments and compliments about developments at Stradbroke Library and in particular the post office:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The addition of the post office and the cafe has been a huge success and well used by the village.”</li>
  <li>“All the staff are friendly and efficient. The post office is a wonderful resource and the cafe is simply brilliant for the community.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The winners of the EDGE Conference awards will be announced on the evening of Thursday 3 March.</p>
