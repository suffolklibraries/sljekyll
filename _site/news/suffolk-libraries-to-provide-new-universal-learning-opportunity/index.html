                        <p>Suffolk Libraries is supporting the launch of a new addition to the National Learning Offers available from libraries.</p>

<p>Today (Thursday 5 November) the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL) and the Association of Senior Education and Children’s Librarians, along with the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy Ed Vaizey and Arts Council England Chief Executive Darren Henley are unveiling new ways for people and communities to learn in public libraries across England.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries already offers four core Universal Learning Offers – Health, Reading, Digital and Information. This launch will add ‘Code Green’ to these offers which is a detailed Digital Making Toolkit, a how-to guide to give customers hands-on experience in computer programming (coding), designing and making 3D objects, building robots, creating apps and many other creative activities for all ages. The Learning Offer resources will build on SCL’s Digital Skills Training programme that reached 14,000 library staff.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries also features in a new short film ‘Lightbulb Moments – Learning in Libraries’ which has been created to highlight the impact that learning in libraries has had on customers across the country. The film features the successful Adult Learning Courses held at Aldeburgh Library and will be available on the SCL website <a href="http://www.goscl.com">www.goscl.com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/144646119">LM01_Community_FC_HD_H264</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user45283601">Elizabeth Elford</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Universal Learning Offer is available in all library services across England and brings together hundreds of unique self-directed learning opportunities for library users, and broadens the range of learning opportunities on offer in local libraries.</p>

<p>In order to support economic growth and the wellbeing of communities, the UK needs to address the skills deficit in our workforce. The CBI estimates that nearly 40% of firms looking for staff with STEM skills have had difficulties recruiting and a recent House of Lords report warns that the UK could be left behind in terms of our digital skills capabilities. The loss to the UK economy because of this lack of skills has been estimated at £2 billion.</p>

<p>Universal Learning Offers in public libraries has been developed so that children, young people and families will be able to build their confidence and skill with their creativity, coding and digital skills. This offer will give families more opportunities to learn together, on a variety of subjects, and help to move through from literacy to fluency. People will grow new skills, find more job opportunities and stimulating experiences in their local area, in a friendly and welcoming environment.</p>

<p>Alison Wheeler, General Manager of Suffolk Libraries is a member of the Society for Chief Librarians and has been involved in the developing this work at a national level. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have been proud to contribute our experience, energy and leadership to this national initiative. Learning in Suffolk libraries has a high profile as we understand how much people, like the ambience, independence and safety in the library environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ciara Eastell, SCL President said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning has always been at the heart of what libraries deliver and libraries are increasingly being used by a wide range of people to develop life-essential skills. With the growth in self-directed learning, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS), the phenomenal success of Open University and others, it is a logical step for libraries to be more central in the learning sector. We plan to widely publicise our unique and free learning resources and we look forward to working with partners to deliver this offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Culture Minister, Ed Vaizey said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to launch the new Universal Learning Offer. SCL and its partners have worked incredibly hard to ensure this offer is a success and that it can be shared with everyone at all stages of their learning journey.</p>

  <p>Libraries are the cornerstones of the communities they serve and this offer will bring a variety of unique learning opportunities into one place. It will create spaces for communities to share ideas and learn together. With the support of the Learning Offer, libraries can build further on great initiatives such as setting up coding clubs, digital training and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Darren Henley, Chief Executive, Arts Council England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libraries have always been great places of learning and this fifth Universal Offer builds on that great heritage. Our libraries have a strong track record in responding to the needs of their communities and I’m particularly excited about the possibilities for libraries to harness the latest technology to make this a reality. Libraries are well placed help young people and adults alike build their confidence and skills in a friendly and welcoming environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ipswich County Library already offers digital making facilities in ‘The Lab’ which is part of the recently developed Enterprise and Innovation Hub which offers 3D printing, digital sewing machines and Raspberry Pi Coding opportunities.</p>

<p>The Society of Chief Librarians (SCL) is a local government association made up of the chief librarian of each library authority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. SCL takes a leading role in the development of public libraries, through sharing best practices, advocating for continuous improvement on behalf of local people, and leading the debate on the future of the public library service. <a href="http://www.goscl.com">www.goscl.com</a></p>

<p>ASCEL – the Association of Senior Children’s and Education Librarians – is the national membership network of senior managers in children’s and young people’s public library services and school library services in the UK. Our aim is to lead excellence in library services for children and young people and schools so that every child and young person visiting a public library should be inspired by an exciting environment which makes reading for pleasure irresistible, and every school has access to a high quality school library service. <a href="http://www.ascel.org.uk">www.ascel.org.uk</a></p>

<p>Arts Council England champions, develops and invests in artistic and cultural experiences that enrich people’s lives. We support a range of activities across the arts, museums and libraries – from theatre to digital art, reading to dance, music to literature, and crafts to collections. Great art and culture inspires us, brings us together and teaches us about ourselves and the world around us. In short, it makes life better. Between 2015 and 2018, we plan to invest £1.1 billion of public money from government and an estimated £700 million from the National Lottery to help create these experiences for as many people as possible across the country. <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk">www.artscouncil.org.uk</a></p>
