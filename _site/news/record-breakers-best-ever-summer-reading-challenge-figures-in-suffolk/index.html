                        <p>Suffolk Libraries are celebrating breaking the record for the number of children taking part in the Summer Reading Challenge across the county.</p>

<p>Around 8,200 children have taken part, which is around 100 more than last year and the third year running that numbers have increased. It’s particularly apt as the theme for this year’s challenge is ‘Record Breakers’!</p>

<p>The Summer Reading Challenge is a national literacy campaign organised by The Reading Agency and run in libraries. The aim is to encourage 4-11 year olds to read up to six library books throughout the summer holidays to maintain reading skills and it’s also a great way of introducing them to their local library.</p>

<p>For the last two years the county has seen increasing numbers of children taking part every year with 7,800 in 2013 and nearly 8,100 in 2014. Children taking part in the Summer Reading Challenge have borrowed around 88,000 items during the summer and nearly 1,500 have signed up to the library service just to take part.</p>

<p>Suffolk has also seen more young volunteers than ever helping to support the challenge with around 200 giving up their time during the holidays to support young children with their reading. They also gave a total of 2,000 hours of their time during the summer to help out along with many other volunteers across the county.</p>

<p>Alison Wheeler, General Manager of Suffolk Libraries, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s fantastic that we’ve seen yet another record breaking year! We are so grateful to all the hard work that staff and volunteers have put in across the county. The summer holidays are one of the busiest times of year for libraries as we get right behind the Summer Reading Challenge and organise a range of events and activities to bring children’s books to life and in many cases introduce young children to their first experience of their local library and the magic of books.</p>
</blockquote>
