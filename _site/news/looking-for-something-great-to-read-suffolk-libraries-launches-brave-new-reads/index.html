                    <p>Suffolk Libraries is launching ‘Brave New Reads’ on Friday 1 May – a list of six brilliant books and a series of related events aimed at readers who are looking for something different.</p>

<p>Formerly known as ‘Summer Reads’, ‘Brave New Reads’ is a guided reading programme taking place across East Anglia. It’s organised by a partnership of the Writers’ Centre Norwich together with the library services of Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. The programme is in its sixth year and the aim is to recommend exciting and original writing to readers looking for something different to read, enjoy and discuss. Suffolk Libraries joined the project in 2014 and the new name of Brave New Reads was suggested by our very own Sophie Green, assistant manager at Woodbridge Library.</p>

<p>The six selected books will be revealed when the project launches on Friday 1 May. The books were chosen by The Readers’ Circle from a longlist of over 150 titles. The involvement of The Readers’ Circle is a major feature of the project and this year the process included readers from Bury and Haverhill who got involved through last year’s programme.</p>

<p>Brave New Reads runs from 1 May to 5 August and the programme also includes author events, book clubs, reading workshops, book quizzes and plenty of online resources.</p>

<p>You can find out more details at www.bravenewreads.org.uk and there is a full list of events below.</p>

<p>Paul Howarth, Stock Manager at Suffolk Libraries said, “We’re delighted to be involved in Brave New Reads this year. The involvement from Suffolk libraries was very successful last year and there is even more going on this time. I hope the chosen books will offer people something different to read and encourage them to get involved with the programme.”</p>
