                    <p>Our recent customer survey suggests satisfaction levels with the county’s library service have improved since the last survey in 2013. Nearly 1,700 people replied to the survey which was carried out in October to November last year, compared to 1,500 who took part in 2013. Here are some of the results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>66% of customers said they visit a library at least once a week (compared to 60% in 2013).</li>
  <li>94% rated staff as excellent or very good which is also an increase from 2013.</li>
  <li>Nearly 49% of people said they thought the service had got better since Suffolk Libraries took over (the figure was 39.42% in 2013) and only just over 3.6% said it had got worse. Nearly 48% said it was about the same. This is very positive considering the library service budget is currently £2.5million less than before the service transferred to Suffolk Libraries.</li>
  <li>89% of people rated our new IT facilities (new computers and Wi-Fi) as excellent, very good or good.</li>
  <li>93% of people felt events and activities at the library were excellent, very good or good.</li>
  <li>91% of people said the choice of books and information was excellent, very good or good.</li>
  <li>89% of respondents rated the choice of free downloads (ebooks, eAudio, music and magazines) as excellent, very good or good.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also had some lovely comments from customers about how highly valued the service is:</p>

<p>“I cannot credit the library enough and the amazing range of books available for my son’s love of books. We always have maximum loans on our cards and still I think he would take 20 more out. He loves the library and we feel so grateful to have this facility so close to home.”</p>

<p>“Excellent service, staff all very helpful in every way not only with books.”</p>

<p>“Suffolk Libraries are wonderful. Keep up the good work!”</p>

<p>“My use of the library overall has improved in the last two years for my needs – thank you.”</p>

<p>“The library is excellent. The present service in Suffolk is very good – especially in comparison with some other parts of the country.”</p>

<p>“I really enjoy using my local library. I have been using them since I was little and found them invaluable. The extra stuff you can now do e.g. computers, eBooks etc is brilliant.”</p>
