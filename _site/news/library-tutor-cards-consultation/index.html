<p>A review of our Schools Library Service highlighted that we have over 1000 tutor cards issued to various groups and people. Our investigation showed that some of these cards are attributed to people who may not need them. Therefore, we’re undertaking a cleaning-up of the system and will be withdrawing the unauthorised cards over the coming months.</p>

<p>If you have a tutor card, please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SLtutorcards">take this short survey</a> and provide proof that you are eligible for your tutor card.</p>

<p>You can also respond by letter. Here is the consultation letter: <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Suffolk-Libraries-tutor-cards-consultation-August-2015.docx">Suffolk Libraries tutor cards consultation August 2015</a> (Word .doc)</p>
