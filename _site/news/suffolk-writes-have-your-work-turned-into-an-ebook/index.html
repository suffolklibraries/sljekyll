                    <p>Suffolk Libraries are launching ‘Suffolk Writes’, an exciting new pilot project giving up and coming writers the opportunity to have their written work turned into a library eBook.</p>

<p>Suffolk Writes could appeal to anyone who has written a novel, short story, poem or collection of poetry and who wants other people to read it.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries will upload the eBook to their Overdrive catalogue which library customers across the county can then download and read for free. There’s no cost to the writer who will still retain the copyright for anything published.</p>

<p>The project is being launched as part of Suffolk Libraries’ Year of Reading to promote reading activities across the county. Suffolk Writes will offer writers the opportunity to get their work published on a professionally presented public platform available to thousands of people.</p>

<p>It will also give library customers a broader range of eBooks to read and may help new authors to be discovered. It could also help to make books on a specific subject of local interest more available.</p>

<p>The project already has the support of local crime author Alison Bruce who has kindly allowed five of her short stories to be published as eBooks for the Suffolk Writes project. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suffolk Writes is an exciting project which will make new work available whilst giving local writers the opportunity to share their work. I have links to both Lakenheath and Newmarket libraries and have made author visits to several of the others so I know how Suffolk Libraries are always looking for innovative ways to support their readers and attract new customers too.</p>

  <p>By embracing eBook technology Suffolk Writes has the opportunity to appeal to readers who perceived libraries as a place for only traditionally published books whilst encouraging existing customers to try out a new format, Personally, I read books on paper and on screen, and I am looking forward to reading the new work that the county’s writers have to offer and I am delighted to be able to contribute some of my short stories to the Suffolk Writes project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The winning entry from the EADT Suffolk Magazine short story competition is also already available to borrow and read.</p>

<p>All writers need to do is provide their work in an ePub format and there are instructions on the Suffolk Libraries website on how to do this. For more details about the project visit <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/suffolkwrites">suffolklibraries.co.uk/suffolkwrites</a> or email <strong>suffolkwrites@suffolklibraries.co.uk</strong>.</p>

<p>Having your book published as a Suffolk Libraries eBook will not affect your right to distribute your work in other ways and Suffolk Libraries will remove it on request if, for example, it’s published by someone else.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries would also be keen to hear from anyone who would like to volunteer to take part in a Suffolk Writes editorial group who will read all contributions before they are added to the catalogue.</p>
