                    <p>Southwold Library will again be running the ‘Slaughter in Southwold’ festival this summer. The increasingly popular Crime Writers Festival will feature a number of top crime writers giving talks about their writing at Reydon Village Hall on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 June.</p>

<p>Slaughter in Southwold is organised by Southwold Library Manager Charlotte Clark with support from the Friends of Southwold Library and the Crime Writers Association. The event is also part of the Southwold Arts Festival and Suffolk Libraries’ Year of Reading campaign.</p>

<p>This year’s packed programme features talks by Helen Callaghan, Hugh Fraser, Paul Harrison, Suzette A. Hill, Andrew Hook, Peter James, Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly, Renee Knight, Anya Lipska and Kate Rhodes.</p>

<p>The festival programme also includes an opportunity to have lunch with the authors on the Saturday and Sunday and there is a workshop for budding crime writers. There is also a fun crime quiz on the Saturday evening and raffle tickets are on sale now with the chance of winning a luxury crime-related hamper. Beccles Books will also be providing books by the authors for sale so there will be a chance to buy books and get them signed.</p>

<p>Charlotte Clark, Southwold Library Manager said: “I’m really thrilled we’ve put together another great programme of author talks and other activities. Crime is one of the best loved genres of books and we’ve got a very diverse range of writers taking part this year. I hope many people will join us for what will hopefully be a fun and interesting series of events.”</p>

<p>Full details of the programme and ticketing information is available from <a href="/events-activities/slaughter-in-southwold">www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/slaughter</a> or <a href="http://www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold">www.ticketsource.co.uk/slaughterinsouthwold</a>. Tickets can also be bought at the library.</p>

<p><strong>About the authors:</strong></p>

<p>Peter James is one of the UK’s most treasured crime and thriller novelists. His Roy Grace detective novels have sold over 17 million copies worldwide in total. Before becoming a full time novelist he has produced numerous films, including <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, starring Al Pacino. Both a film and a TV adaptation of the Roy Grace series are currently in development. Peter has been two-times Chair of the Crime Writers’ Association and has won many literary awards, including the publicly voted ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards People’s Bestseller Dagger.</p>

<p>Hugh Fraser is best known as the actor who played Captain Hastings alongside David Suchet’s Poirot in the long running and much loved television series. In July 2015, Hugh made his debut as a writer with his first novel, <cite>Harm</cite>.</p>

<p>Paul Harrison is a retired police officer who was an undercover football hooligan and was one of the first British police officers to work with the FBI psychological serial killer profiling unit in Quantico. He is now the best-selling author of 35 books and as a media, crime and police consultant is behind the creation of many of the well-known television detectives.</p>

<p>Alison Joseph, Erin Kelly and Kate Rhodes represent Killer Women, a group of London-based crime writers. Their talk will bring the world of crime fiction to life as they discuss how men and women relate to violence in crime fiction.</p>

<p>Alison Joseph is the author of the series of novels featuring Sister Agnes, a contemporary detective nun. <cite>Murder Will Out</cite> is the first of a new series featuring Agatha Christie as a detective.</p>

<p>Erin Kelly is best known for her debut novel, <cite>The Poison Tree</cite>, which was a major ITV drama and a Richard and Judy Bestseller. She is the author of three more acclaimed psychological thrillers as well as the official novel of the Bafta-winning Broadchurch.</p>

<p>Kate Rhodes has published four novels in the Alice Quentin series and will also be hosting a workshop on how to write a crime novel during the festival.</p>

<p>Suzette A. Hill has published nine novels including the humorous Reverend Oughterard quintet (A Load of Old Bones etc.) and the subsequent Rosy Gilchrist series, the latest being <cite>A Southwold Mystery</cite>.</p>

<p>Anya Lipska writes detective thrillers featuring Janusz Kiszka, private eye to London’s Polish community, and police detective DC Natalie Kershaw. Her trilogy may soon be made into a BBC Drama. Anya also works as a TV producer with credits on a dizzying variety of programmes from <cite>Panorama</cite> to <cite>Monty Don’s Italian Gardens</cite>.</p>

<p>Renée Knight worked for the BBC directing arts documentaries before turning to writing. She has had TV and film scripts commissioned by the BBC, Channel Four and Capital Films. <cite>Disclaimer</cite> is her first novel arising from that course.</p>

<p>Local crime writers Helen Callaghan and Andrew Hook are both local writers. Helen’s first novel, <cite>Dear Amy</cite>, is to be published in hardcover by Michael Joseph in spring 2016 and Andrew is a much-published Norwich-based author.</p>

<p>Tickets are £5 for an individual talk or it’s £15 for a day pass or £30 for the whole weekend. The crime writing workshop is £5 and not included in day passes. Lunches also need to be booked separately. Anyone needing more information can contact the library on 01502 722519. All events take place at Reydon Village Hall and not the library.</p>
