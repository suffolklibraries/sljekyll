                        <p>Suffolk Libraries are calling on people to show their support for libraries as National Libraries Day approaches by signing a national petition.</p>

<p>The ‘My Library My Right’ petition has been set up by The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP). It asks library users everywhere to show their support for a campaign which reminds everyone that public libraries are a statutory service, at a time when library services across the UK are having to make significant cuts. You can find out more and <a href="/news/sign-the-my-library-by-right-petition-to-protect-library-services-everywhere">sign the petition</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationallibrariesday.org.uk/">National Libraries Day</a> on Saturday 6 February celebrates why libraries matter. It’ll be the fifth National Libraries Day – a day of events and activities promoting the difference that modern libraries make to people, families and communities across the UK.</p>

<p>Libraries are a vitally important, valued and loved public service. With over 280 million visits in 2013-14, going to the library is one of the most popular activities in the UK. More people went to the library than to Premier League football matches (13.9 million), the theatre (22 million) and cinema (165.5 million) combined.</p>

<p>You can see how well loved our libraries are by reading some of the <a href="/news/suffolk-libraries-customer-survey-results-2015">feedback from our recent customer survey</a>.</p>

<p>Alison Wheeler, Chief Executive of Suffolk Libraries, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>National Libraries Day this year is giving a real focus to championing the country’s libraries and reminding people that they have a right to them. We know from the feedback and stories we receive from staff and customers how well loved and appreciated Suffolk’s Libraries are. In a way every day is libraries day in Suffolk as there is always an event, activity or interaction happening in a library that enriches or makes a difference to someone’s life. All of the county’s 44 libraries are open on Saturdays so why not pop in on National Libraries Day and take a look?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tony Brown, Chair of Suffolk Libraries Board, added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past five years the people of Suffolk have really shown their backing for libraries and hundreds of people, like myself, are now members of their library community groups, helping to develop and support their library. National Libraries Day is a perfect time to remind people that we still need this support and how much it makes a difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>National Libraries Day ambassador for 2016 is award-winning crime writer and creator of hit TV series Shetland and Vera, Ann Cleeves. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libraries matter. If we believe in equality of opportunity we must fight not just for the buildings but for the range of books inside and the skilled staff who can promote reading in all its forms. Not only do libraries encourage us to be more tolerant and better informed, they contribute enormously to the wealth of the nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>National Libraries Day events are also taking place in libraries in Suffolk on Saturday 6 February:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At Southwold Library there will be a ‘My First Library Visit’ event all day (from 9.30am to 5pm) to encourage children and adults to visit the library for the first time to see what’s on offer for all the family. Regular customers are also being asked to share their early memories of visiting a library for the first time for a National Libraries Day display.</li>
  <li>Brandon Library will be showcasing online services and the eLibrary titles which customers can download for free. There will also be a celebration of events and developments at the library over the past year and storytime, crafts and colouring from 2pm to 4pm.</li>
  <li>Woodbridge Library is hosting a Book Bonanza with Mandy Hearle who will be raising money for Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders. Please contact the library for further details. The library is also holding a sale of withdrawn fiction all weekend.</li>
  <li>Hadleigh Library will be celebrating National Libraries Day with The Scrumptious Sisters who will be at the library from 10am to 4pm with their delicious cakes and preserves. All produce is home-made with butter and free range eggs. The Friends of Hadleigh Library will also be providing tea and coffee and a chance to find out about the important work they do to support and develop the library.</li>
  <li>Lowestoft Library are hosting an information event for people interested in becoming a foster carer from 10am to 4pm. Whilst not directly linked to National Libraries Day this is a great example of the way libraries provide a perfect place for community organisations to get their message out to hundreds of people.</li>
  <li>Saxmundham Library is also hosting a pottery painting session from 2pm and Halesworth Library is running an Italian workshop from 1pm to 4pm. Anyone interested can contact the libraries directly for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suffolk Libraries are also currently promoting <a href="/new-suggestions/childrens-ya-books/national-libraries-day-for-children-in-2016/">a list of children’s books for National Libraries Day</a> which all have a library theme.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Suffolk Libraries Day many libraries are also hosting events for Harry Potter Book Night on Thursday 4 February, many of which are already sold out.</p>
