                    <p>Elmswell Library will be closing for two weeks from Monday 5 October in preparation for a major refurbishment.</p>

<p>The work will involve the installation of new shelving, much of which will be moveable to create more space for community events. There will also be a new welcome desk and new sections for children and young people. The children’s section will have new chairs and furniture for children and their parents and the teenage section will have new comfy chairs.</p>

<p>The refurbishment is being funded by a successful fundraising drive which has raised over £10,000 thanks to the support of the Elmswell Library Friends and the local community.</p>

<p>Emma Yarrow, Elmswell Library Manager, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted that we are going to soon be able to transform the library. The changes should give the library a more modern feel, so it’s smarter and more welcoming, providing a more flexible space for us and any groups that want to use our library.</p>

  <p>It should be a better space for our Baby Bounce and Tot Rock groups for young children. We are also aiming to be ‘dementia friendly’, with plain carpets so as not to confuse or distress those who are living with the condition and our signage will be clear and easy to understand. Our staff have all also attended a Dementia Information Session so they are more understanding and patient with those with symptoms.</p>

  <p>We want to turn our little library into a community hub, somewhere everyone is welcome, information is easily accessible, customers feel supported and where we can inspire learning and literacy in a comfortable environment with more up-to-date resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jimmy Jewell, Chair of the Elmswell Library Friends (ELF) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ELF are delighted to have raised such a large sum of money in such a short space of time. Grateful thanks are extended to all those who kindly donated towards the appeal and to all those who have helped in making the various fund raising events such a success. The refurbished library will be the pride of Elmswell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The library will be closed for two weeks and reopen on Monday 20 October. The paintwork will be completed for free by West Suffolk College City and Guilds painting and decorating students which is not only saving money, but also helping the students to complete their course.</p>

<p>The amount raised for the project to date is £15,000 which will go a long way to completing the first phase of the planned refurbishment and by the end of the year ELF also hope to purchase a coffee machine.</p>

<p>The funding has come from a number of donations and fundraising initiatives involving customers, local people and businesses. The now annual Elmswheelian cycle ride events have raised over £2,000 and there have been popular wine and cheese evenings at the library with local wine expert Bob Stopp.</p>

<p>Other donations include £2,000 from county councillor Jane Storey’s locality budget, £1,000 from Shadwell Racing Stud, £1,000 from East of England Co-op and £1,000 from David Black and Son. Funding has also been received from the Alfred Williams Trust, Elmswell Firefighters and Waitrose (Bury St Edmunds).</p>

<p>The plans are on display in the library for anyone who would like more information.</p>

<p>Suffolk Libraries apologises for any inconvenience to customers during the closure. The loan period for borrowed books will be extended so no loans will be due for return whilst the library is closed. Customers can also visit Ixworth, Thurston, Stowmarket and Bury St Edmunds libraries.</p>
