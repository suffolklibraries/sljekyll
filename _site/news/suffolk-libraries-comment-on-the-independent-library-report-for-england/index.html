                    <p>Suffolk Libraries has welcomed the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-library-report-for-england">Independent Library Report for England on the future of public libraries</a> which has been published today (Thursday 18 December).</p>

<p>The report was commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Communities and Local Government and has been carried out by an independent panel led by William Sieghart. <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/announcements/suffolk-libraries-agm-2014" title="Suffolk Libraries AGM 2014">Mr Sieghart spoke at Suffolk Libraries’ AGM in September 2014</a> and visited the county while researching the report. The report features a case study of the <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/about/" title="About">Suffolk Libraries independent model</a>.</p>

<p>The report highlights the importance and potential of library services and also stresses how important it is that this report results in positive action to support libraries across the country.</p>

<p>There are three major recommendations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The provision of a national digital resource for libraries</li>
  <li>Setting up a ‘task and finish force’, which will</li>
  <li>work with local authorities to help them improve and revitalise their library service, while aiming to increase community involvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tony Brown, chair of Suffolk Libraries’ Board and chair of the Beccles Library Community Trust, one of <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/about/member-organisations/" title="Member organisations">44 community groups</a> formed to support Suffolk’s libraries, said:</p>

<p>“We welcome this report which strongly endorses the direction Suffolk Libraries has adopted in the past three years. The report focuses on community involvement and digital services – both areas in which Suffolk has made great strides in recent years. We are proud of what has been achieved here in Suffolk by our organisation, our staff and the amazing support from the community.</p>

<p>“Working to strengthen links with the community is so important for a library service – particularly in a place like Suffolk with a number of small towns and villages where people rely on their library.</p>

<p>“Our community groups have worked with library staff to generate fantastic ideas and developments with activities such as live music, arts opportunities, award-winning groups of teenagers helping to run activities for young people and a huge range of popular activities for children and families.“</p>

<p>Alison Wheeler, general manager of Suffolk Libraries, added: “We welcome the report’s recommendation of setting up of a taskforce and recognise that a vision to strengthen libraries everywhere is important for the entire country as strong and modern library services provide significant benefits for everyone.”</p>

<p>“Library services across the country are facing significant funding challenges and changes in use; the same challenges which had to be tackled here in Suffolk three years ago. We’re ready to act and do our bit to help other services. Many have already been expressing an interest in our model and we’re planning an event in March to share what we’ve learned with other councils.“</p>
