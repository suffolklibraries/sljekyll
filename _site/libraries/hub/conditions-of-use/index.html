                    <p>For the purpose of these Conditions of Use, the following definitions are used:</p>

<p><strong>Display:</strong> the use of space to inform or entertain customers by means of posters, illustrative materials and/or leaflets.</p>

<p><strong>Exhibition:</strong> the use of space to promote the sale and/or appreciation of works of art and craft, or the sale of other items of a commercial nature.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting:</strong> the use of space to allow people to meet for a specific purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Hirer:</strong> the person who makes an application to hire library premises in accordance with these Conditions of Use whether on his/her behalf or on behalf of an organisation. The Hirer is responsible for ensuring that these Conditions of Use and any other additional requests made by the library manager are adhered to.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All displays, exhibitions and meetings arranged to take place on library premises are conditional upon the judgement of the appropriate library manager that their subjects and presentation do not contravene any law or regulation, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing in particular in the fields of libel or religious hatred, obscenity or riotous assembly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgement of the local library manager determines what material may be displayed or exhibited, and the period and circumstances of the display or exhibition. The decision of the local library manager is final. Displays and exhibitions are accepted on the condition that they are suitable to be viewed by all library customers and that they provide accurate information in a reasoned and thoughtful manner; propaganda is not acceptable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In approving the use of library premises for the display of matters of public interest or as a part of the process of public debate, Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd implies no interest in, or responsibility for, the views expressed, unless the items are themselves the official publications of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for the purposes of the Representation of the People Act, library premises may not be used during the five week period preceding national or local elections if in the judgement of a local library manager a display, exhibition or meeting has a political content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be no advertisement on the outside of the library building of any display, exhibition or meeting that has a political content, or is arranged on behalf of a political organisation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaflets and publications may be left with a display or exhibition on a self-help basis. The active distribution of material is not permitted without the prior written approval of the library manager, nor may such material be left out for sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All displays and exhibitions must carry a disclaimer of sufficient size and prominence to compete on equal terms with the rest of the display. The disclaimer shall read: Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd accepts in good faith the material submitted for display or exhibition by members of the community, and we cannot be held responsible for its quality of accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No internal or external promotion of a display or exhibition shall be undertaken without the prior written agreement of the library manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All displays and exhibitions must include the name and address of a local contact of the Hirer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No petitions are allowed on library premises for the purposes of obtaining signatures or support. No money may be collected on library premises as part of a display unless approved by a library manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Displays and exhibitions must be approved in advance by a library manager and in any case before the organiser leaves the premises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority will be given to displays and exhibitions with local connections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hirer shall:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) not be indemnified against or hold Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd liable for any loss to the Hirer (including economic loss) arising either directly or indirectly from the cancellation or postponement of the hiring whether or not such cancellation or postponement is due to any act or default of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd, its agents or servants;</p>

<p>b) indemnify Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd against any damage or loss of property or injury to or death of any person howsoever caused arising out of the hiring or any operations ancillary thereto including the use of the Hirer’s own equipment unless in the case of death or personal injury it was due to the act or fault of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd, it’s employees or agents. The Hirer is deemed to be the “responsible person” for any damage howsoever caused during the period of hire. This includes damage to furniture, fabric, fixtures and fittings. Suffolk Libraries will recharge any costs incurred for repairs direct to the Hirer in addition to the hire charge. Where a deposit has been paid, this will be used to contribute to such costs.</p>

<p>c) the Hirer shall not disclose any security codes for alarm or door systems that are made known to him/her, unless it is in the interest of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd to do so.</p>

<p>d) acquaint him/herself and others in the group, if appropriate, with the emergency and evacuation procedures for the building. In addition the Hirer is to ensure that fire exits are kept clear at all times and that fire doors are not wedged open.</p>

<p>e) nominate a named person to take responsibility for the security and safety of the Room, if no library staff are on duty at the time of hiring, and for ensuring that emergency and evacuation procedures are followed in the event of an emergency;</p>

<p>f) not bring their own electrical equipment unless it has been tested by an approved or suitably qualified person;</p>

<p>g) leave the premises in a clean and tidy condition. Any subsequent costs incurred by Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd as a direct result of failure to do so will be passed on to the Hirer.</p>

  <li>
    <p>If the premises are required for dramatic, musical or film recitals, or if optical projections of any kind are used, the Hirer must guarantee that permission, where necessary, has been obtained from copyright holders for public performance and that the requirements of the Licensing Authorities have been met.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Bookings may not be made more than one year in advance.</p>

  <li>
    <p>All invoices must be paid within 30 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cancellations or changes to bookings made less than 7 days prior to the confirmed booking will be invoiced for the full sum of their booking; no-shows will be considered as cancellations and treated in the same manner.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd reserve the right to refuse any application for hire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No application shall be accepted from persons under eighteen years of age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the information provided by the Hirer is found to be misleading or if the Hirer contravenes these Conditions of Use, Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd may:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) cancel the booking without warning;</p>

<p>b) terminate the hire immediately;</p>

<p>c) refuse to accept any further bookings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Hirer shall not sub-hire the premises or any part of it. Any breach of this condition shall result in the immediate cancellation of a booking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hirer shall not do or permit to be done anything which may cause nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd or any other persons or staff using the premises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hirer shall be sufficiently covered by a policy or policies of insurance against contingencies set out in these Conditions of Use. The library manager may require the Hirer to produce copies of the aforesaid policies for inspection at any reasonable time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd any library managers may refuse the right of entry to any person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of persons allowed on the premises at any one time shall not exceed the stated maximum number permitted.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without Prejudice to any prior or other rights which Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd may have against the Hirer, the hiring may be terminated by Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd without notice and without compensation if the Hirer causes or permits any breach of these Conditions of Use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hirer is reminded to abide by current Copyright Law when using Suffolk Libraries equipment to produce/reproduce items/articles on any equipment. Suffolk’s Libraries IPS Ltd will not be held responsible for any infringement of Copyright Law.</p>
