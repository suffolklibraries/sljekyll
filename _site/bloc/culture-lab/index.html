                    <p class="ma0 measure">Mike Challis is a freelance sound artist, maker and educator. His work increasingly engages with the sounds of nature. His SoundHide for SPILL 2016 created a den in a straw lined hut where the audience could relax and listen to the sounds of nature in Ipswich’s green spaces. He's made sound designs for Oily Cart Theatre Company’s Kubla Khan and Hush-A-Bye. Mike enjoys making work by walking, creating pieces from the resulting sound material collected. He also enjoys making devices to do interesting, useful and useless things.</p>

Together with artist Freddy Morris, she established a foundry and studio in Suffolk. She has exhibited in the UK, USA, Netherlands and Australia. Working in bronze as her primary material, her practice is concerned with physicality and our limitations as material things &#8211; a state often actively disregarded within anthropocentric conceptions of the world. </p>

Cad’s work can manifest in: Interactive installations, analogue adventures to tech driven projects, conversations, events and noise.</p>

                    <p class="ma0 measure">Phoebe Pryor's work revolves around wayfinding and taking note of the unassuming details in our surroundings. Phoebe is playful in her approach and driven by (often repetitive) processes, through patterns, actions and movement. Phoebe enjoys spontaneous mark making and allowing materials to perform in their own way. The way people experience space is a preoccupation of hers. Phoebe records sounds and trace journeys, combining them with the shapes and symbols around us to create a drawing or ‘map’ of the environment. Within this Phoebe collects and researches methods of communication through language, signs and symbols. </p>

This has fed into recent work using virtual reality as a mechanism to transmit data, and communicate traces, to exploit the essence of print in a post-digital landscape. Emily is currently researching and developing the application of AI to VR. She hopes to create positive behaviour changing experiences surrounding sustainability issues. She has exhibited and presented works in Suffolk at Aldeburgh Beach Lookout and SPILL Festival, as well as further afield at galleries including Somerset House.</p>

                    <p class="ma0 measure">Kristy Campbell’s practice aims to convey a visual language that demonstrates the fluid ambiguity of meaning, hence of reading; through discourse, design, and changing contexts. This study of semiotics challenges linguistic traditions, methods of curation, and medium, but more intensively it confronts the connotation forced and attached to particular words. Deconstruction and Deconstructivism theory fuel this. They intend to tilt, to fragment, and to stylize forming a dysfunctional and seemingly misguided structure, making way for an accessible alternative freedom within language.</p>

She is increasingly curious about where therapy meets performance and her evolving practice means that she is often at the interface of both. Her practice draws on her experience in community dance working alongside diverse groups. Her curiosity in exploring movement is key, allowing for each individual to explore their own playful, creative potential.  Lynnette seeks out opportunities to explore movement in its broadest form whilst combining other art forms to influence her work.</p>

Sandy previously worked in magazine publishing but always dreamed of returning to her first love of writing and illustrating stories. Experimenting with traditional printmaking and drawing techniques in her illustrations, Sandy embraces the accidental marks and unpredictable results that printmaking can bring. This initial mark-making is further developed as digital collages and layered compositions. When Sandy is not writing, drawing or getting inky fingernails, she can be found walking along the beautiful East Anglian coastline.</p>

These communities explore concepts of the human condition that exists within individual homes which disperses into the local community.  Consumption is investigated through the injection of receipt cuttings, questioning the impact belongings have upon human beings. Using her creative core in drawing, Stella creates larger installations, and childish short films that explore the roles that communities have within society and use a childish approach to communicate complex thinking through naïve, playful aesthetics.</p>
