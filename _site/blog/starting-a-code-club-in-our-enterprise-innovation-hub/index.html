">Starting a Code Club in our Enterprise + Innovation Hub</h1>

        <p>I’m the assistant library manager at Ipswich County Library. As part of my role I have responsibility for the <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/hub">Enterprise and Innovation Hub</a> located on the top floor of the library, which is where our weekly <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a> is held.</p>

<p>I first heard about Code Club a while ago while carrying out a volunteer role I have outside of the library. The concept interested me, but at that point I wasn’t in a position to be able to move forward. When I started at Ipswich County Library in August 2015 I was quite keen to investigate the idea of a Code Club further. By coincidence a volunteer came in to ask if we could start a Code Club in the library. I didn’t need asking twice!</p>

<p>We’ve set up our Code Club with a combination of volunteers; Code Club, <a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk/">STEMnet</a> and high school students. I started off with one volunteer who was very proactive getting other volunteers on board — she continues to be extremely helpful and is an active volunteer at the sessions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/eadt-first-library-code-club-a-big-success.jpg" alt="Newspaper cutting" /></p>

<p><em>Our Code Club was featured in the local paper</em></p>

<p>At each session we generally have 2 Code Club/STEM volunteers and a couple of High School students. The High School students focus on troubleshooting IT and this allows the Code Club/STEM volunteers to interact with the children.</p>

<p>Our group started off at 8 children, after the first group of sessions this was increased to 14. The children range in age from 6-11, the youngest children generally have their parents helping them with the material and the group work well together. We don’t have a rigid structure where the children work systematically through the projects. Instead the children choose their own projects to suit their interest and ability working at their own level — if they choose one that is too hard or too easy they soon change it for another one.</p>

<p><em>Coding in the hub</em></p>

<p>The greatest challenge for our Code Club is also our greatest triumph. The club has been more popular than I imagined. The waiting list continues to grow faster than we can create spaces in our club! I’m now considering starting a second Code Club. I’ve approached a local college who have Level 3 Game Design and IT students to see any of them would like to gain some valuable work experience.</p>

<p>My advice to anyone else working in a library and considering starting a Code Club would be: Go for it, what have you got to lose? It’s a really great experience to see the children engaged and learning at a Club they have chosen to come to.</p>
