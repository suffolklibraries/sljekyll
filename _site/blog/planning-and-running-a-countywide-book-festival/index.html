                <p>March was an exciting month with our first ever countywide book festival, which I had the privilege of co-ordinating.</p>

<p>We started planning the festival last year with the aim of continuing our commitment to books and reading, which is obviously just part of the great offer that we have available. We are also one of the first library services in the country to deliver a countywide book festival!</p>

<p>We had 21 events at 12 locations across the county which all took place in just two weeks. This included childrenâ€™s events, a poetry event, non-fiction events, workshops and bestselling fiction authors.</p>

<p>As you can imagine this involved a great deal of co-ordinating and managing. I was in touch with authors, publishers, external venues and library staff on a daily basis from months before the festival begin.</p>

<p>I was amazed by the amount of emails co-ordinating this project created, from confirming the authors attending each event, to ensuring we had the correct publicity information for our programme and website, to arranging refreshments, alcohol licences, staffing and book sellers for events.</p>

<p><em>Me (left) interviewing Kate Hamer.</em></p>

<p>I also contacted local and national companies to ask them if they would be interested in becoming sponsors of Bookfest and was delighted and grateful that several of them replied offering their sponsorship as well as helping us promote the festival in the county.</p>

<p>Once the festival begun, I spent my evenings travelling around Suffolk to help deliver the events at the libraries and external venues. I had the wonderful opportunity to meet and interview Kate Hamer at Bungay Library, who has recently release her brilliant debut novel <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite>.</p>

<p>What an amazing few weeks!</p>

<p>It was fantastic for us to welcome such a superb selection of authors to the county and we are thrilled that so many of you enjoyed the events we organised.</p>

<p>We are reviewing the festival in April with plans to bring more great events and authors to Suffolk again next year.</p>

<p>Thank you to all of you that supported us in this new venture and if you did not get a chance to come to the festival this year, we hope to see you in 2016!</p>
