<p>For Anti Bullying Week, we’ve put together a list of recommendations for children and young adults on the subject of bullying.</p>

<p>Bullying can be frightening and isolating, so we hope that these titles help young people who are being bullied to feel less alone, and seek help.</p>

<p>Even if they’re not being bullied, it’s important for children to understand how it feels to be in such a situation and learn what to do if they experience or witness bullying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The headmaster of Trinity College asks Archie Costello, the leader of the Vigils, a secret society that rules the school, to help with the selling of 20,000 boxes of chocolates in the annual fund-raising effort. Archie sees the chance of adding to his power - he is the Assigner, handing out to the boys tasks to be performed if they are to survive in the school.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freshman, Jerry Renault, a newcomer to the corrupt regime, refuses to sell chocolates. Enormous mental and physical pressure is put on him but he will not give in - the result is an inevitable, explosive tragedy.”</p>
