<blockquote>
  <p>“In days gone by, people understood that a knock to your health takes its toll on your emotions, your relationships, your morale, your ‘spirit’. But these days, we think that if the doctor has waved you off, then you are ‘better’. We neglect what scientific studies show is a vital element of recovery: the emotional side of getting better. As a result, many of us struggle with hidden issues such as depression, stress and anxiety long after a health crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book centres on the crucial, research-based truth that ‘getting better’ is not just about the body - emotions play a huge part.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalitis, (CFS/ME) affects approximately 180,000 people in the UK. In addition to persistent and abnormal tiredness, sufferers commonly experience muscle pain, headaches, sleep disturbance and loss of concentration as well as a range of other symptoms. At its worst it can be completely disabling and yet it is still poorly understood and often regarded as purely psychological.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This practical manual comes from a nationally recognized centre for the condition and is jointly written by health professionals and their patients. They give straightforward and specific expert advice, accompanied by real life stories, on managing different aspects of everyday life that can affect energy, and they show how to put this advice into practice.”</p>

Whatever the cause, the sufferer endures complete disruption to their life and excruciating pain that no drug can alleviate. <cite>Manage Your Pain</cite> can guide anyone towards taking the first steps on the path towards recovery from pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Drawing on the authors’ extensive experience and the latest research, <cite>Manage Your Pain</cite> explains the positive and practical ways in which you can adapt to chronic pain and minimise the impact it has on your life. The way forward is to understand that there is a pattern to the pain you suffer and that practical steps can be taken to return to normal life.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sudden, severe ill health comes as a shock and presents several challenges, most notably, loss of confidence. Suddenly people are afraid to take exercise, have sex or even go to the shops. Their entire self-image takes a battering, and this rollercoaster of uncertainty often leads to anxiety and depression. This book looks at the learning curve involved in sudden and chronic illness, and explores key ways to build psychological resilience during this time of challenge.”</p>

  <p>“Six million people in the UK provide unpaid care for disabled or elderly relatives or neighbours. Oddly, though they are by definition anything but selfish, they are prone to feelings of guilt, brought on by isolation and fatigue. This book explores what carers and others should know about caring.”</p>

    <p class="ma0 mb2 f6 f5-ns">My name is Sarah Lungley and I am the coordinator for Suffolk Libraries Mental Health and Wellbeing Information Service.</p>

    <p class="ma0 mb2 f6 f5-ns">My role is to help provide information on local services and to promote events in our libraries and the community that can support mental health and wellbeing.</p>

    <p class="ma0 mb2 f6 f5-ns">The service also aims to support our library staff, to ensure they are able to access useful and up-to-date information for our customers should they request it.</p>

    <p class="ma0 mb2 f6 f5-ns">Libraries are a fantastic resource, not only for books and information but for community, friendships and fun too. So pop in to your local branch or explore our website to find out more about what we do – we hope to see you soon!</p>
