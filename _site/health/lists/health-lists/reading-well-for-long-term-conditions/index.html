<h3 id="how-to-feel-better-practical-ways-to-recover-well-from-illness-and-injury-by-frances-goodhart--lucy-atkins"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1336400"><cite>How to Feel Better: Practical ways to recover well from Illness and Injury</cite>, by Frances Goodhart &amp; Lucy Atkins</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In days gone by, people understood that a knock to your health takes its toll on your emotions, your relationships, your morale, your ‘spirit’. But these days, we think that if the doctor has waved you off, then you are ‘better’. We neglect what scientific studies show is a vital element of recovery: the emotional side of getting better. As a result, many of us struggle with hidden issues such as depression, stress and anxiety long after a health crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This book centres on the crucial, research-based truth that ‘getting better’ is not just about the body - emotions play a huge part.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalitis, (CFS/ME) affects approximately 180,000 people in the UK. In addition to persistent and abnormal tiredness, sufferers commonly experience muscle pain, headaches, sleep disturbance and loss of concentration as well as a range of other symptoms. At its worst it can be completely disabling and yet it is still poorly understood and often regarded as purely psychological.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This practical manual comes from a nationally recognized centre for the condition and is jointly written by health professionals and their patients. They give straightforward and specific expert advice, accompanied by real life stories, on managing different aspects of everyday life that can affect energy, and they show how to put this advice into practice.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Drawing on the authors’ extensive experience and the latest research, <cite>Manage Your Pain</cite> explains the positive and practical ways in which you can adapt to chronic pain and minimise the impact it has on your life.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sudden, severe ill health comes as a shock and presents several challenges, most notably, loss of confidence. Suddenly people are afraid to take exercise, have sex or even go to the shops.

<blockquote>
  <p>“IBS is an invisible disease - sufferers battle on pretending nothing is wrong and hiding their embarrassing symptoms. And it isn’t life-threatening - so why would anyone take it seriously? Yet it can seriously restrict how we live, work and play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Based on their experience as both sufferers and health specialists, Dr Arroll and Professor Dancey provide the latest guidance on the causes, diagnosis and treatment, including the hugely significant part played by stress.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Asthma is a very common condition, affecting people of all ages from infant to adult.
