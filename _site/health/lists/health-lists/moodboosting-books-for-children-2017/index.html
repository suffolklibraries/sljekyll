<p><a href="http://reading-well.org.uk">Reading Well</a> have brought out a new list of uplifting titles for young people. The books were suggested by Reading Hack groups, young library volunteers and visitors to the Southbank’s 2016 YA Weekender, with the final list being decided by young people from Shoreditch Library.</p>

<h2 id="the-art-of-being-normal-by-lisa-williamson"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1888043"><cite>The Art of Being Normal</cite>, by Lisa Williamson</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“David is funny and quirky and has always felt different from other people - but he also has a huge secret that only his two best friends know. Ever since he can remember, he has felt like a girl trapped in the body of a boy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="more-than-this-by-patrick-ness"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1581437"><cite>More Than This</cite>, by Patrick Ness</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A boy called Seth drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments, losing his life as the pounding sea claims him. But then he wakes. How is that possible? And where is this place? It looks like the suburban English town where he lived as a child, before an unthinkable tragedy happened and his family moved to America. But the neighbourhood around his old house is overgrown, covered in dust and completely abandoned. What’s going on?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="wonder-by-r-j-palacio"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1275125"><cite>Wonder</cite>, by R. J. Palacio</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>Wonder</cite> is the funny, sweet and incredibly moving story of Auggie Pullman. Born with a terrible facial abnormality, this shy, bright ten-year-old has been home-schooled by his parents for his whole life, in an attempt to protect him from the stares and cruelty of the outside world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="finding-cherokee-brown-by-siobhan-curham"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1305751"><cite>Finding Cherokee Brown</cite>, by Siobhan Curham</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I decided to write a book about my life I thought I’d have to make loads of stuff up. I mean, who wants to read about someone like me? But as soon as I started writing, the weirdest thing happened. I found out I wasn’t who I thought I was. And I stopped being scared. Best of all, I discovered that when you finally decide to be brave it’s like waving a wand over your life - the most magical things can happen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-rest-of-us-just-live-here-by-patrick-ness"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1958138"><cite>The Rest Of Us Just Live Here</cite>, by Patrick Ness</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This bold, irreverent novel powerfully asks what if you weren’t the ‘chosen one’? The one who’s supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death? What if you were like Mikey? Who just wants to graduate and go to prom and maybe finally work up the courage to ask Henna out before someone goes and blows up his high school. Again. Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this week’s end of the world and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life. Even if your best friend might just be the God of mountain lions!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="we-should-all-be-feminists-by-chimamanda-adichie-ngozi"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1703509"><cite>We Should All Be Feminists</cite>, by Chimamanda Adichie Ngozi</a></h2>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="eleanor--park-by-rainbow-rowell"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1307073"><cite>Eleanor &amp; Park</cite>, by Rainbow Rowell</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Eleanor is the new girl in town, and with her chaotic family life, her mismatched clothes and unruly red hair, she couldn’t stick out more if she tried. Park is the boy at the back of the bus. Black T-shirts, headphones, head in a book - he thinks he’s made himself invisible. But not to Eleanor. Slowly, steadily, through late-night conversations and an ever-growing stack of mix tapes, Eleanor and Park fall for each other. They fall in love the way you do the first time, when you’re young, and you feel as if you have nothing and everything to lose.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="i-capture-the-castle-by-dodie-smith"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1271099"><cite>I Capture The Castle</cite>, by Dodie Smith</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When they meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the two loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special kind of friendship - the kind of friendship that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through their friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves - and about the kind of people they want to be.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Living on the South Crongton council estate has its worries - and life for McKay has been even tougher since his mum died. His dad has been working all hours to keep the bailiffs from their door. His brother is always out riding the streets at night, tempting trouble. And now, having strayed off his turf on a ‘heroic’ (if misguided) mission to help out a girl, McKay finds himself facing a friend’s crazy ex-boyfriend, some power-tripping hood-rats and a notoriously violent gangster with a vendetta which hits too close to home. Poor McKay. He never asked for trouble. But during one madcap night of adventure and danger, he will find out who his true friends are and what it means to stick with your family.”</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every summer, Rose goes with her mum and dad to a lake house in Awago Beach. It’s their getaway, their refuge. Rosie’s friend Windy is always there, too, like the little sister she never had.
