<p>One of the standouts on the BBC Sound of 2014 list, this Brighton based duo are played on Radio 1 but do not fit in with the singer-songwriters and electronic acts. They share some similarities with Arctic Monkeys, who have championed them, but Royal Blood are more similar to White Stripes or Queens of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>If you like your rock riff heavy and loud then look no further.</p>

<p>Although technically this is released at the end of July, it would be a shame to miss this one.</p>

<p>Clapton has often stated that JJ Cale is one of the single most important figures in rock history, a sentiment echoed by many of his fellow musicians. Cale’s influence on Clapton was profound, and his influence on many more of today’s artists cannot be understated.</p>

<p>To honour JJ’s legacy, a year after his death, Clapton gathered a group of like–minded friends and musicians for this album. With performances by Clapton, Mark Knopfler, John Mayer, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, Derek Trucks and Don White, the album features 16 beloved JJ Cale songs and is named after the 1972 single Call Me The Breeze.</p>

<h3 id="pumeza-voice-of-hope">Pumeza: Voice of Hope</h3>

<p>(Coming soon)</p>

<p>Lyric soprano Pumeza Matshikiza is introduced in a unique album which tells her incredible and inspirational story in music: from her childhood in the townships of South Africa to the stage of Europe’s great opera houses with classic South African songs including Miriam Makeba’s greatest hits: Pata Pata and The Click Song, and arias by Puccini and Mozart.</p>

<p>Growing up amid the violence of apartheid in 1980s South Africa, Pumeza moved with her mother from one township to another around Cape Town looking for ever-safer places to live. She discovered opera by accident, channel-surfing the radio as a teenager. Overcoming extraordinary obstacles and prejudice she eventually enrolled at the South African College of Music in Mandela’s post-apartheid world.</p>

<p>South African composer Kevin Volans recognized the distinctive beauty of her voice and bought her a plane ticket to London where she auditioned for the Royal College of Music. She was immediately offered a full scholarship, and from there she went on to join the Young Artist Programme at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Today she is a leading artist at Stuttgart Opera.</p>

<p>On 14 March 2011, Heap started work on her forthcoming album, (then unnamed), as fans sent in nearly 900 “sound seeds”, or samples of everyday sounds such as a “dishwasher door”, a “bicycle” or a “burning match”. Three years later the sounds became the album Sparks.</p>

<p>An album that spends the majority of its running time looking back. Elliot Gleave’s latest collection of dancefloor imperatives mines his influences for inspiration, creating an air of mid–90s Top Of The Pops amid more of the melodies that have made him a chart staple in his own right.</p>

<h3 id="wanted-on-voyage-by-george-ezrahttpsuffolklibrariesfreegalmusiccomartistsviewr2vvcmdliev6cme29122931c29ueq"><a href="http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/R2VvcmdlIEV6cmE=/29122931/c29ueQ">Wanted on Voyage by George Ezra</a></h3>

<p>There is something about blonde, angelically handsome 21–year–old Hertfordshire singer-songwriter George Ezra that strikes a genuinely authentic note. Playing guitar, bass and keyboards, Ezra delivers structurally simple songs with enormous gusto, suggesting an uncynical, joyous release in the very act of making music.</p>
