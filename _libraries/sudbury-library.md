branch-news: "Due to a safety issue caused by the current weather, the children’s library in Sudbury Library will be closed until further notice. We hope to resolve the problem as soon as we can but in the meantime a small selection of children’s books will be available in the main library. This does not affect access to the rest of the library and we apologise for any inconvenience. Due to this safety issue, the <strong>Storytime and Craft Activities sessions will be held in the main library</strong> for the foreseeable future."
