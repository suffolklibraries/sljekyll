### [<cite>Betty goes bananas in her pyjamas</cite> by Steve Antony](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19589680?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49561805)&QRYTEXT=Betty%20goes%20bananas%20in%20her%20pyjamas)

      This is my absolute favourite book of the month. I love Steve Antony’s work; it always makes me smile. As for Betty, she is a phenomenon in her own right; a toddler (gorilla) with a stubborn streak. Correction- it’s not a streak, the whole of her being is stubborn. She emanates stubbornness; she is stubbornness. If you’ve ever tried to get an unwilling toddler to bed, you’ll feel for the poor old toucan.

### [<cite>Ten little dinosaurs</cite> by Mike Brownlow and Simon Rickerty](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19590632?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48743814)&QRYTEXT=Ten%20little%20dinosaurs)

    <p>
      This is my absolute favourite book of the month too. The rhyming text is gloriously funny and the illustrations are a perfect match. Who could have predicted that Brownlow and Rickerty could come up with a rival to <cite>Ten Little Pirates</cite> or <cite>Ten Little Princesses</cite>? They have surpassed themselves with this one and created another witty classic. The dinosaurs have character, charm, charisma and buckets of child appeal as we follow them through their first day on earth, from egg to bedtime.

### [<cite>Who woke the animals?</cite> by Charles Fuge and David Conway](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19592437?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48743836)&QRYTEXT=Who%20woke%20the%20animals%3F)

    <p>
      If you have fond memories of Charles Fuge’s <cite>Bedtime hullaballoo</cite>, you’ll be as pleased as we were to find it has been republished here (though why under this new title is beyond me). If you have no such memories and the book is new to you, then you’re in for a treat. It’s a wonderful bedtime read &#8211; filled with humour, repetition and a richness of language. The illustrations are packed with expression; just masterful. And the answer? A tiny shrew.

### [<cite>Where, oh where is Rosie’s chick?</cite> by Pat Hutchins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19594195?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48743833)&QRYTEXT=Where%2C%20oh%20where%20is%20Rosie%27s%20chick%3F)

    <p>
      Way back when (1968 actually), Pat Hutchins produced her timeless classic <cite>Rosie’s Walk</cite>. Here, after all these long years, is a sequel in that same distinctive style. With a colour palette limited to yellow, green and orange, the illustrations resemble woodcuts in their simplicity. The original story was simple too, and the original Rosie remained calm as she walked through the farmyard blissfully unaware of the fox who followed her and the calamities which befell him. This Rosie is in a bit of a flap – as well she might be, for the fox has had children since we last met.

      A heart-warming/heart-breaking story about Joe, an autistic boy left alone in his tower block flat whilst his mum holidays in Spain. It incorporates major life themes such as bullying, friendship and racism into a truly remarkable book. A marvellous, inspiring and funny read. Great for avid readers of 9 and above. Perhaps this is my favourite book of the month!

    <p>
      A real nail-biter of a novel about a refugee family resettled in London following death threats from the Taliban. With an English boy and an Afghan girl as protagonists, this exciting crime story is full of suspense and danger. It includes scenes of violence which can be quite frightening, but these are offset by the courage displayed by the central characters.
