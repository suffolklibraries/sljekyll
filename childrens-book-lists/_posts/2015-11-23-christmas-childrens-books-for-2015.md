      It’s super to see a new Spot book this Christmas. This one has nice sturdy flaps so even very young children can turn the pages. It’s a guessing game, or in National Curriculum parlance, &#8216;inference&#8217;!

      We love this book of the TV ad. It so perfectly represents Christmas – burnt turkey, tree falling over and all. How utterly joyous that Judith Kerr has had time to write and draw another Mog book, and that she made a cameo appearance in the advert! Long live Judith Kerr, our heroine.

      When a winter storm hits Pinewood, everyone’s Christmas wishes get mixed up (they were written on luggage labels hanging on a tree in the centre of the town), and that’s when the magic started. Lucy, James and her little dog (who can now talk) try to sort it all out in this cosy Christmas read. Lovely.

      Borrow this hilarious tale of festive fun from a library near you now. You won’t regret it! Well you might if you have to read it several times on the trot, or if it gives the children you know any ideas for merry-making mayhem, but by then it will be too late.

      “The Christmas story and what follows: the fleeing of Jesus, Mary and Joseph from Herod&#8217;s soldiers to Egypt. This is a book with timeless crossover appeal and a message that couldn&#8217;t be more relevant.“
