      Gorgeously produced on lovely thick paper with illustrations dabbed with humour (it’s published by Andersen Press who know a thing or two about making gorgeous books) this picture book is a must. It’s about a young rabbit, mighty suspicious of the baby (wolf) whose arrival is greeted by the rest of the family with coos and smiles and photos. Wonderful , wonderful, wonderful.

Then, one day” she finds her grandmother on Facebook, and hopes she can unlock the mystery of who she really is, why they are there and why her mother never goes out. It’s a brilliant read, once you get your head round the code that the author uses throughout, substituting one word for another eg kindle for kitchen, dormouse for door etc.
