## Board books for babies and toddlers

### [<cite>Busy Bookshop</cite> by Marion Billot](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13186880?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37689775)&QRYTEXT=Busy%20bookshop)

      Given the perplexing absence of &#8216;Busy library&#8217; from the <cite>Busy books</cite> series, this jolly little book will have to do. After all, it does celebrate stories and has a nice twiddly bit on each page, complicated enough to absorb rather than frustrate a child at the poking stage of development.

## Picture books for 2-5 year olds

### [<cite>The Book with No Pictures</cite> by B.J. Novak](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13193973?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47357484)&QRYTEXT=The%20Book%20with%20No%20Pictures)

      No pictures, but loads of made-up words, a fan following and <a href="http://thebookwithnopictures.com/">its own website</a>. As a script writer, B. J. Novak is used to putting words into people’s mouths. See what he’s put into ours: “ GLuURR-GA-wocko ma GRUMPH-a-doo AiiEE! AiiEE! AiiEE! BRROOOOoOG BRROOOOoOG OOOOOOmph! EEEEEEmph! Blaggity-BLaGGITY GLIBBITY-globbity globbity-GLIBBITY BEEP. Boop. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee B DooonGY FACE!!!!”! Synthetic phonics, or what?!

      If you’re exhausted after late Christmas bedtimes and long for normality, this lovely new story could set you on the way. There’s quite a lot of text, but it rhymes, it’s funny and it winds gently down to the end.

      Take a dash of mystery and a dollop of friendship, mix well with cute illustrations and you have the recipe for this new title in the <cite>Hello Kitty and Friends</cite> series aimed at 7 to 9 year olds. There are about 14 other titles to read if this one takes your fancy.

## Junior novels for 8–12 year olds

      Russell Brand’s re-telling of this traditional tale will not be to everyone’s taste, (frequently including words like &#8220;gob&#8221; and &#8220;bum&#8221;), but Chris Riddell’s illustrations are sheer genius. His rats are a masterpiece of evil and his sinister Piper oozes menace.

      Saving cows from an abattoir is an unlikely sub-plot, but this debut novel set on a Welsh housing estate is about much more. It deals with the loneliness of a girl whose father is in prison, an unlikely friendship she forms with girl from a nearby farm, and about a community who come together for a common cause. After just one chapter, I’m totally hooked.

      Read all the <cite>Wimpy Kids</cite> and <cite>Big Nates</cite>? Need another laugh? Timmy Failure, CEO of the aptly named detective agency, Failure Inc could fill your anti-hero gap. However, this is his third book, so you may prefer to read the first two books. Philip Ardagh, well-known author of <cite>The Grunts</cite> describes the <cite>Timmy Failure</cite> series as “original and quirky, with real heart” and we would never disagree with him &#8211; have you seen how tall he is?

      Zoe Sugg, vlogger with 3.5 million followers, debuts her first book. It’s about Penny, a panic struck, anxiety ridden teenager whose dad advises her to keep a diary. Penny decides to start a blog instead and this is the story of that blog. I was hooked before the end of the first page, but I can’t read it yet because so many other people in Suffolk want to read it too. Be quick, that’s all I can say! (And if unlike Penny, you fancy starting a diary instead of a blog, keep a lookout for our next book list, coming soon to a website near you!)
