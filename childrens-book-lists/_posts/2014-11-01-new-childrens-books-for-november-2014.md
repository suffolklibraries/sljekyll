<cite>Sam & Dave</cite> hits the mark firmly as a picture book worth your while. Illustrated by the seriously talented Jon Klassen, <cite>Sam & Dave</cite> provides a picturesque journey of two boys and a dog who set out on a mission to dig until they find something spectacular. The boys believe they are finding nothing, but unfazed by this they keep on digging until eventually they fall asleep. Yet, as reader&#8217;s will find out their day turns out to be pretty spectacular after all.

### [<cite>Stanley the Builder</cite> by William Bee](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9503674?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39182926)&QRYTEXT=Stanley%20the%20builder)

### [<cite>Here Be Monsters</cite> by Jonathan Emmett](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9504939?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(220727)&QRYTEXT=Here%20be%20monsters)

[![Here Be Monsters by Jonathan Emmett](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/herebemonsters.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9504939?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(220727)&QRYTEXT=Here%20be%20monsters)

If you’re looking for an exciting rhyming story to read aloud, you can’t go far wrong with <cite>Here Be Monsters</cite>. In this Pirate ditty Captain Cut-Throat ignores the pleas of his dastardly crew and sails on in search of Treasure Island, regardless of the dire warnings on his map. This is a witty tale that teaches about greed and its comeuppance.

### [<cite>Use Your Imagination</cite> by Nicola O&#8217;Byrne](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9507095?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39645411)&QRYTEXT=Use%20your%20imagination)

[![Use Your Imagination by Nicola O'Byrne](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/useyourimagination.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9507095?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39645411)&QRYTEXT=Use%20your%20imagination)

Another brilliantly clever picture book from Nicola O’Byrne, this time featuring a wicked librarian wolf who tries to outwit a delightfully innocent rabbit. With beautiful illustrations that will enliven any child&#8217;s imagination, this picture book provides laughs from start to finish and morals akin to one of Aesop&#8217;s Fables.

### [<cite>The Parent Agency</cite> by David Baddiel](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9509723?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44635641)&QRYTEXT=The%20parent%20agency)

[![The Parent Agency by David Baddiel](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/parentagency.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9509723?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44635641)&QRYTEXT=The%20parent%20agency)

The list of things Barry blames his parents for is extensive. He spends most of his day being cross with them until finally his wish to “have better parents” comes true. The Parent Agency is a brilliantly funny novel whose readable style makes it accessible to all.

### [<cite>Five Children on the Western Front</cite> by Kate Saunders](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9510763?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38546184)&QRYTEXT=Five%20children%20on%20the%20Western%20Front)

[![Five Children on the Western Front by Kate Saunders](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5childrenwesternfront.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9510763?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38546184)&QRYTEXT=Five%20children%20on%20the%20Western%20Front)

This is a gripping novel that projects the characters from Edith Nesbit’s <cite>Five Children and It</cite> into the First World War. In this sequel, the Psammead has lost his power to grant wishes and is forced to face his past before he finds it again. Written with passion, sympathy and conviction this book will soon find it’s way onto all “must read” lists. But at 318 pages, it’s a substantial read that doesn&#8217;t shy away from the horrors of war, so may be unsuitable for children under 10.

Crammed full with great illustrations, captioned photographs and quirky anatomical questions, this book may be short but you won&#8217;t put it down from start to finish.
