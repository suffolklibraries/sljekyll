      Mrs. Baker hates Holling Hoodhood. There&#8217;s no two ways about it, as far as he can tell. From the minute he entered her classroom she had it in for him and he&#8217;s trying not to become paranoid. Now because half the kids in his class are Jewish and half Catholic, every Wednesday Holling (a Protestant through and through) is stuck alone with Mrs. Baker while the other kids go to Hebrew School or Catechism for the afternoon. And what has this evil genius dreamt up for our poor young hero? Shakespeare. He has to read it and get tested on it regularly with the intention (Holling is sure) of boring him to death. The thing is, Holling kind of gets to like the stuff.

      In the Houses of Montague and Capulet, there is only one goal: power. The boys are born to fight and die for honour and &#8211; if they survive &#8211; marry for influence and money, not love. The girls are assets, to be spent wisely. Their fates are written on the day they are born. Benvolio Montague, cousin to Romeo, knows all this. He expects to die for his cousin, for his house, but a spark of rebellion still lives inside him. At night, he is the Prince of Shadows, the greatest thief in Verona &#8211; and he risks all as he steals from House Capulet. In doing so, he sets eyes on convent-bound Rosaline, and a terrible curse begins that will claim the lives of many in Verona.
