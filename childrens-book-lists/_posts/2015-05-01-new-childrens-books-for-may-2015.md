      “It would simply cause a terrible fuss!” This beautifully illustrated book is a riotous rhyming romp, perfect to read aloud or to pore over. Set to become a classic, it would be great for playgroup topics about transport or animals, as well as a joy in itself. David Tazzyman illustrates the <cite>Mr Gum</cite> books too, so is a master of the joyously daft.

      A repetitive musical rhyme involving a mouse, a bird, a warthog and more. It gets your feet tapping and would be fun to read with a group (as long as you don’t mind rude bits).
