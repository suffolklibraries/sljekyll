*An amazing Ormiston Denes library display.*

I was invited to a Suffolk Schools’ <cite>Battle of the Books</cite> this week, and had such an amazing time!

The competition was between Ormiston Denes, Bungay High, Pakefield and Sir John Leman secondary schools. Each school selects one book for the competition, pupils then have an opportunity to read all four books before the schools meet up at the final and vote for a winner.

## Let Battle Commence

At the final, each school campaigns for their chosen book with a persuasive presentation. There are then small, mixed discussion groups, before two rounds of voting to decide which school, and book, has won. This was the tenth year the event had been held, adding another layer of gravitas!

The four books fighting it out were [<cite>The Honest Truth</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8937199?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46865243)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20honest%20truth) by Dan Gemeinhart, [<cite>Hate</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8936617?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(448259)&amp;QRYTEXT=Hate) by Alan Gibbons, [<cite>Slated</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8935382?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1025251)&amp;QRYTEXT=Slated) by Teri Terry and [<cite>Listen to the Moon</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8937773?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39946120)&amp;QRYTEXT=Listen%20to%20the%20moon) by Michael Morpurgo. I read all four books in advance, and had strong feelings about each title. For me there were two stand out books and I did have a favourite – unfortunately I found out on the day that adults were not allowed to vote!

The pupil presentations for each book were outstanding. Pupils of all ages spoke passionately about their chosen book: talking about their personal responses to what they had read, adding background details and historical information. The presentations all looked very professional, and used a range of media including handmade props, costumes and video (including some brilliant stop motion animation). My mind went from firmly made up to completed undecided!

After the presentations, representatives from each school formed small groups to discuss all four books. The four young people on my table were soon involved in a passionate discussion, with some admitting that the book their school was championing was no longer the one they would be voting for! There was also an interesting discussion about reading in general, with two girls surprised to discover a mutual love of Charles Dickens, Jack the Ripper and strange Victorian customs.

## Choosing a winner

Round one of the voting resulted in <cite>Hate</cite> and <cite>Listen to the Moon</cite> being eliminated. <cite>The Honest Truth</cite> by Dan Gemeinhart and <cite>Slated</cite> by Teri Terry would slog it out in the final.

Before the final vote, I spoke about reading for pleasure and held a version of my [emoji book](/assets/ppt/beyond-the-book-emoji-book-quiz.pptx) and [blanked out book](/assets/ppt/beyond-the-book-blanked-out-book-titles-quiz.pptx) quizzes – in which the winning pupil scored an impressive 18 out of 20. These were some serious readers!

The final vote was held and the votes checked and independently verified. It was close, but the winner, championed by Pakefield School, was <cite>Slated</cite> by Teri Terry.

## The Winning Book

<cite>Slated</cite> had been my favourite of the four books, and a book I might never have encountered but for Battle of the Books. It is the story of 16-year-old Kyla who has been 'slated' for her supposed past crimes: all of her old memories have been erased and her entire personality wiped blank. Assigned a new name, new date of birth and even new parents, Kyla understandably struggles to adapt to her changed life. Her story is an addictive, fast-paced, dystopian masterpiece set in a bleak futuristic Britain. I urge you to read it and discover why it deservedly won the Battle of the Books!

Pakefield School collected the impressive trophy and posed for pictures. Planning for Battle of the Books 2017 is already underway.

Thank you to the staff and pupils for inviting me!

## Conclusion

This was a brilliant event, and one that could be run in any school as a tutor group activity (either between individual tutees or between tutor groups). It is a great way to be introduced to new authors and genres, and pupils could be assigned specific roles such as presenter, head of marketing, video director etc.
