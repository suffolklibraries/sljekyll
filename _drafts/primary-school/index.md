Our libraries are family friendly places that offer free internet use and wifi.

All our libraries run [activities for children](/events-activities/children/) of all ages, including craft sessions, story times and author visits. We also run the national [Summer Reading Challenge](http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/) every year.

Children can have their own library card and borrow books for free.

## What we stock

We arrange children’s books to match with the way your child learns.

<strong>We don’t stock reading schemes</strong>. Instead, we buy as wide a range of other books as we can that will support your child’s reading at school. These include:

## Using the library to improve your child’s reading skills

You can help your children by bringing them to the library to choose books.

We stock thousands of books for all levels:

* When they’ve just learnt a few letter sounds
* When they’re beginning to read with some support
* When they can read short sentences
* When they’re independent readers

You can be a reading role-model for children. As well as reading imaginative books to and with them, you can ask them to:

* read the recipes for you when you cook
* read out a shopping list when you go round the supermarket
* read road signs, labels and instructions or the TV guide

## Using the library to help your child’s emotional development

Children who read for pleasure do better at school. Before you even get to the educational stuff like increasing vocabulary and phonic awareness, you can also help nurture a child’s emotional development, self-esteem and capacity to empathise with others.
