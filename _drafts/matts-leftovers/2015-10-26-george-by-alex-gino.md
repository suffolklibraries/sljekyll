![George by Alex Gino](/images/featured/featured-george.jpg)

<cite>George</cite> is making waves in reading communities around the globe. It is a wonderful tale of an American transgender girl who dreams of playing Charlotte the spider in a school production of Charlotte’s Web – a dream that is soon squashed by her school and family.

Author Alex Gino presents some authentic and warm characters to the reader; and although themes of sadness, isolation and loneliness are never far away there is also an overriding sense of hope and lots of humour.

It is a sweetly written story of friendship, growing up and of overcoming obstacles. The short author bio on the back cover says it all in that it reflects “the diversity and complexity of being alive”.

You can hear the author Alex Gino talk about their book below in a video produced by Scholastic for [The Guardian Children&#8217;s Books](http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site) site (a fantastic place for info on books for all ages!).
