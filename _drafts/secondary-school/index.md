Our libraries are family friendly places that offer free internet use and wifi.

All our libraries run the national [Summer Reading Challenge](http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/) every year, in which teenagers can volunteer to hear younger children read and talk to them about their book choices. This volunteering can count towards a Duke of Edinburgh award.

Teenagers can have their own library card and borrow books for free.

## What we stock

We have a wide range of physical books and [eBooks](/elibrary/) for teenagers to read. In future, Young Adult books will be shelved with Adult fiction.
