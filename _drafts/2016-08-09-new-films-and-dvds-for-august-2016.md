Jon Favreau directs this fantasy adventure remake of the 1967 film inspired by Rudyard Kipling's book. The story follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a young boy who has been raised by wolves, who is forced to leave the jungle after he is attacked by the terrifying tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba). After hearing of the death of Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), the leader of the wolves who raised him, Mowgli vows to return to the jungle to confront Shere Khan and end his tyrannical rule once and for all. With the help of bear Baloo (Bill Murray) and panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) Mowgli sets off on a dangerous journey with the future of the jungle hanging in the balance. The film also features the voice talents of Scarlet Johansson as Kaa and Christopher Walken as King Louie.

Cedric Nicolas-Troyan directs this fantasy sequel based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Eric the Huntsman who has been trained by the embittered Ice Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) to become a solider in her army of deadly hunters. When she realises that Eric and another, Sara (Jessica Chastain), have broken her one sacred rule - that her huntsmen forever harden their hearts to love, they are banished. The fate of the kingdom may be in their hands however, when Freya brings her sister, the evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron), back from the dead using the Magic Mirror and their combined power threatens to cast the land into darkness.
