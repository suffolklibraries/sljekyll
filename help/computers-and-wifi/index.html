<h2>Computers in our libraries</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/book-a-computer">book a computer online</a> before you visit any of our libraries. Most libraries also have computers that are available without a booking.</p>

<p>We offer 3 types of computer for public use in our libraries, all of which take USB sticks and can be used for printing.</p>

<h3>Chromebook laptops</h3>

<p>You can sit anywhere you want to in the library by borrowing one of our Chromebooks. These are fast, simple machines, ideal for browsing, checking email, going on Facebook and so on.</p>

<p>Rules for borrowing a Chromebook:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You must have less than £14 in unpaid fines on your account</li>
    <li>You must have paid for any library items you have lost in the past</li>
    <li>If you have been a member of the library for less than three months, you may be asked for additional proof of address</li>
    <li>You can borrow a Chromebook for 1-2 hours, depending on the library. There is a 13p fine for every minute you have the Chromebook beyond the time limit.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for any damage caused to the Chromebook while it is in your possession, and may be liable to pay up to £180 depending on the extent of the damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chromebase computers</h3>

Like the Chromebook laptops, these machines are ideal for browser-based activities.

<h3>Windows PCs</h3>

These machines feature more software than the Chromebooks and Chromebases, including Microsoft Office, making them the best choice for editing and printing documents such as CVs, letters and essays.
