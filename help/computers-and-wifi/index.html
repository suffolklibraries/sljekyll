<h2>Computers in our libraries</h2>

<p>You can book a computer at <strong>all Suffolk libraries and Suffolk record offices</strong>. You can book up to 21 days in advance with a maximum of 15 bookings every 21 days.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/book-a-computer">book a computer online</a>.</p>

<p>Most libraries have computers that are <strong>available without a booking</strong>.</p>

<p>You can plug a USB stick into any of our computers and print a document.</p>

<p>We offer 3 types of computer for public use in our libraries.</p>

<h3>Chromebook laptops</h3>

You can sit anywhere you want to in the library by borrowing one of our Chromebooks. These are fast, simple machines, ideal for browsing, checking email, going on Facebook and so on.

<h3>Chromebase computers</h3>

Like the Chromebook laptops, these machines are ideal for browser-based activities.

<h3>Windows PCs</h3>

These machines feature more software than the Chromebooks and Chromebases, including Microsoft Office, making them the best choice for editing and printing documents such as CVs, letters and essays.
