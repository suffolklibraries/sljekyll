Your library card membership expires automatically after 3 years. This helps us keep our data up to date.

You won’t be able to use our services when this happens.

## Renewing your library card

**To re–register and renew your card fill in the form below.**

Alternatively, you can:

  * call customer service on **01473 263838**
  * take your library card to any library in Suffolk

You won’t need to apply for a new library card to re–register.

If you are new to Suffolk Libraries, you can [apply for a new library card](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/JOIN).
