<h2>Computers in our libraries</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/book-a-computer">book a computer online</a> before you visit any of our libraries. Most libraries also have computers that are available without a booking.</p>

<p>We offer 3 types of computer for public use in our libraries, all of which take USB sticks and can be used for printing.</p>

<h3>Chromebook laptops</h3>

<p>You can sit anywhere you want to in the library by borrowing one of our Chromebooks. These are fast, simple machines, ideal for browsing, checking email, going on Facebook and so on.</p>

<h3>Chromebase computers</h3>

<p><img src="/images/featured/featured-chromebase.jpg" alt="A Chromebase PC"></p>

Like the Chromebook laptops, these machines are ideal for browser-based activities.

<h3>Windows PCs</h3>

These machines feature more software than the Chromebooks and Chromebases, including Microsoft Office, making them the best choice for editing and printing documents such as CVs, letters and essays.
