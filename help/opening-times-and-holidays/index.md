Our library opening hours vary from library to library.

**[Find a library and its opening times](/libraries/)**.

**Our libraries will be closing early on Christmas Eve**. You can find individual libraries' opening hours for Christmas Eve via the link above.

We close for [all UK public holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays), including Good Friday and Easter Sunday.

We also close for one extra day over Christmas. **This year we will be closed on 27 December**.
