All our libraries offer free, unlimited wifi. [Find your local library](/libraries/).

We use 2 wifi providers. Ipswich County, Bury St Edmunds, Lowestoft and Brandon use O2 wifi, while all other libraries use Polkaspots wifi.

## Accessing wifi

### Using the Polkaspots service

Most of our sites use a service called **Polkaspots**.

To use wifi you need to

  * Connect to the wireless network called **Suffolk Libraries** (this is just the same as connecting to any other wireless network)
  * Open a browser (such as Firefox, Chrome, Opera or Internet Explorer) and visit any web page.
  * You should see a welcome page. Enter a valid email address and click the &#8216;Click here to login&#8217; button:

  * You&#8217;ll then see this screen:

<img src="/images/help/wifi2-email.jpg" />

You can now use the internet as you normally would.

Note you can use the same email address for two devices, such as a laptop and a mobile phone.

### Using the O2 service

Brandon, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich County and Lowestoft libraries use a wifi service provided by O2. [See the O2 website for intructions](https://www.o2wifi.co.uk/my).
