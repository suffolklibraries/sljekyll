## What you can do on our computers

We provide a mix of [Chromebase computers](http://www.lg.com/uk/chromebase), Windows computers and [Chromebook laptops](http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/devices/).

The Chromebase computers and Chromebook laptops are fast, simple machines ideal for browsing, checking email, going on Facebook etc.

The Windows machines provide more software, such as Microsoft Office.

You can plug a USB stick into any of our computers and print a document.

We provide [free WiFi across most of our libraries](/help/using-wifi-in-libraries/ "Using wifi in libraries"), so you can use a Chromebook anywhere in your library, or bring your own laptop, tablet or phone.
