## Print books, CDs and DVDs

Please note: **We don&#8217;t charge for reservations**, unless you&#8217;re making an interlibrary loan.

### Finding and reserving online

You can [search our catalogue of print books, CDs and DVDs](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH) and reserve any title you find. You can also specify which branch you want to collect your titles from.

Try our [fiction, non–fiction, music, children&#8217;s books and DVD film lists](/new-suggestions) for ideas.

Read [our guide to using the catalogue](/help/using-our-online-catalogue/ "Using our online catalogue") to get the best search results.

To find a title you can either do a [quick search](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH) or an [advanced search](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/COMB).

When you perform a search the catalogue will make suggestions as you type. You can either click on one of the suggestions or ignore them.

You can fill in as many or as few of the boxes as you like.

When you enter a search, the catalogue will display a list of titles it thinks match your request. The list looks like this:

You can reserve as many of these titles as you like. Simply click the box by the title and press the blue **Reserve Selections** button above the list of results.

If you haven&#8217;t already logged in, you&#8217;ll be asked to enter your library card number and your 4 digit PIN. You&#8217;ll also be asked which library you want to collect the book from and a date when we can end your reservation:

Once you&#8217;ve filled in the form, click the **Place Reservation** button.

### Reservation notifications and collections

Once your reservation is ready we&#8217;ll email or text you, depending on whether you provided us with your email address or mobile number when you created your library account.

If we don&#8217;t have your email address or mobile number you&#8217;ll have to visit [your nearest branch](/branches/ "Branches"), [email or call us](/contact/) to check if it&#8217;s arrived.

If you&#8217;d like to receive emails or text either visit a branch or [login to your library account](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/LOGINB).

Reservations take about a week to arrive, but we can&#8217;t guarantee this.

## eBooks, MP3s or eAudio books

See our [guides to using our eLibrary services](/help/using-our-elibrary-service) for instructions on finding, borrowing and renewing eBooks or eAudio books.

When you [‘borrow’ an MP3 or eAudio book](/elibrary/) from us you simply download it to your device.
