## Borrowing titles

Whether you have [reserved a title](/find-and-reserve-print-titles-dvds-cds/) or found a title you wish to borrow on the library shelves, you can borrow it using one of our self-service machines or by seeing staff at the library desk. You will need your library card.

**Note:** if you are borrowing an audiobook, CD or DVD you'll need to take it to the desk for staff to issue.

## Renewing titles

To renew books online:

1. [Log in to your library account](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/LOGINB)
2. Click 'My Account' in the top right-hand corner
3. Select 'Current loans' in the pane in the middle of the page
4. Either check the checkboxes next to the loans you wish to renew and click the 'Renew selections' button, or click 'Renew all' if you would like to renew all your loans. We will automatically renew all loans that can be renewed.

**Note:** if you are using a mobile device, you may not be able to see the whole 'Current loans' table. To see the rest of the table, simply scroll across using your thumb.

You can also call [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) (available 24/7 with an out-of-hours answering service) or visit any [Suffolk library](/libraries/).

You can **renew a book up to six times** unless it is reserved by someone else.

Any overdue charges or new hire charges (eg for DVDs) will be logged to your account up to a **credit limit of £14**. You can pay your charges at any of our libraries or by calling us on [01473 351249](tel:01473351249).

## Returning titles

You can return a title at any [Suffolk library](/libraries/) by using one of our self-service machines or handing it to staff at the library desk.

Many of our libraries have out-of-hours book returns. [Visit your local library's page](/libraries/) to find out if they offer this service.
