## What we use cookies for

**To collect anonymous usage information.** Like most websites, we use an analytics service to track usage of our website (in our case Google Analytics). We cannot identify you from the analytics data we collect. We collect information such as what pages you visit, what website you came from, how long you spend on the site, what browser and operating system you use and your service provider&#8217;s network identity.

You can choose to stop Google Analytics collecting information by downloading and installing browser plugins, such as [Google&#8217;s own Analytics opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or [No Google Analytics for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-google-analytics/?src=search).

**Saving your details when you add a comment to our website.** Our website uses software called WordPress to display pages and process comments you make on these pages. To enter a comment on our website you need to enter your name and email address. We store these details, but the public can only see your name with your comment (and you are free to use a pseudonym if you wish).

WordPress uses cookies to enter your name and email address whenever you return to a comment form.

## Deleting cookies
