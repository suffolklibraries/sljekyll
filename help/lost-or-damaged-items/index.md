If you've lost or damaged one of our items, report it to [any Suffolk Library](/libraries/), call [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) or email **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**

A charge for the title's cover price will be added to your account. You can pay this at [your local library](/libraries/) or by calling us on [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) at your convenience.

As long as you have **less than Â£14 owing on your account**, you can continue to use our services.

**We don't accept replacement copies of items**. This is because the replacement title may not be the same edition, or of sufficient quality for our collections. Alternatively, our stock team may prefer to use the replacement fee to buy new and different titles.
