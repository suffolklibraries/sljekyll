<h3 id="spine">Borrowing titles from Cambridgeshire libraries</h3>

As part of our SPINE partnership, our customers can borrow titles from Cambridgeshire libraries' stock for a charge of **£2 per title**.

You can find and reserve titles from Cambridgeshire through [our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH?HOMEPRMS=GENPARAMS).

If you search for a title in Suffolk and we don’t have it, our catalogue will give you an option to expand your search to include Cambridgeshire’s service.

![A page with no search results]()

**Note: you can’t just search Cambridgeshire’s titles. You have to search Suffolk and Cambridgeshire’s titles at the same time.**

<h3 id=ill>Reserving titles from other library services</h3>

If a title is not available through us or Cambridgeshire Libraries, you can [suggest a title for stock](/help/suggest-a-title/) or request an inter-library loan. You can do this by visiting [any Suffolk Library](/libraries/), calling [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) or emailing **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**

Let us know:

* The name of the title
* The author(s) of the title
* Any additional details you have about the title (for example, year of publication or ISBN)
* Your library card number
* Which of our libraries you wish to collect the title from.

**We will only charge you if we successfully fulfil your request**.

<h3 id="charges">Charges for loans from other library services</h3>

Due to the cost, we will always ask you whether you wish to extend your search to the British Library.
