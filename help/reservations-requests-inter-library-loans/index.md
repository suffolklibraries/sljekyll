<h3 id="spine">Borrowing titles from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough libraries</h3>

As part of our SPINE partnership, our customers can borrow titles from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough libraries' stock for a charge of **£2 per title**.

You can find and reserve titles from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough by visiting [any Suffolk Library](/libraries), [contacting us](/contact/) or through [our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/BSEARCH?HOMEPRMS=GENPARAMS).

If you search for a title in Suffolk and we don’t have it, our catalogue will give you an option to expand your search to include Cambridgeshire and Peterborough's services.

If you click this link we’ll present you with search results from Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

If your search brings up some results, but not the ones you're looking for, our results page gives you the option to expand your search to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

**Note: you can’t just search Cambridgeshire and/or Peterborough’s titles. You have to search Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough’s titles at the same time.**

If you find the title you want, you can go on to [reserve it in the normal way](/help/find-and-reserve-print-titles-dvds-and-cds/#reserving). You'll [receive notifications](/help/find-and-reserve-print-titles-dvds-and-cds/#notifications) and collect it in the same way as usual.

**Note: If you reserve a title from Cambridgeshire or Peterborough you’ll be charged £2.**

Sometimes, the same title is available from one or more library services. Should you place a reservation on one of these titles, you can choose which service to reserve the title from. To avoid a charge, choose Suffolk:

<h3 id="ill">Reserving titles from other library services (inter-library loans)</h3>

If a title is not available through us or Cambridgeshire Libraries, you can [suggest a title for stock](/help/suggest-a-title/) or request an inter-library loan. You can do this by visiting [any Suffolk Library](/libraries/), calling [01473 351249](tel:01473351249) or emailing **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**

Let us know:

* The name of the title
* The author(s) of the title
* Any additional details you have about the title (for example, year of publication or ISBN)
* Your library card number
* Which of our libraries you wish to collect the title from.

**We will only charge you if we successfully fulfil your request**.

<h3 id="charges">Charges for loans from other library services</h3>

Due to the cost, we will always ask you whether you wish to extend your search to the British Library.
