You will shortly receive a welcome letter and your enamel pin badge in the post. If you do not wish to receive the badge, email **supporter@suffolklibraries.co.uk** with **No Badge** in the subject line.

Look out for your special Supporter email newsletter around the 15th of each month! You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any point following the instructions at the bottom of the email.

Your membership lasts one year. At the end of the year we'll ask if you'd like to sign up again.
