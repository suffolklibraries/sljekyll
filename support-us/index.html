      <h2 class="f4 f3-ns mb2 custom-lh-title">Why we need your support</h2>

      <p><strong>We’re a charity</strong> that provides all of Suffolk’s library services. Many people don’t realise we’re independent from Suffolk County Council.</p>

      <p>We haven’t closed any libraries since taking over their control in 2012. In fact, we now reach thousands more people every year, through events, pre-school activities, wellbeing drop-ins, arts residencies and by simply providing a safe, non-judgemental place to be. And we lend physical and digital books – millions of them every year.</p>

      <p>Suffolk County Council provides most of our funding. However, our budget is more than a third less than in 2012, and the Council continues to face cuts from central government.</p>

      <p class="f3-ns"><strong>We make life in Suffolk better</strong> and you can help us carry on our work by donating.</p>
