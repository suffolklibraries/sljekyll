Suffolk Libraries is a membership organisation made up of 44 member groups, known as community or friends groups. These groups provide support and ideas for the development of their local library. They also help to raise funds for improvements or new equipment.

You can get involved with your local community group in various ways, including supporting the library with an annual subscription, voting on the group's leadership and goals and helping to recruit new members, raise funds and organise and run events.
