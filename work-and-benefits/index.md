## Universal credit

### Using library computers for Universal Credit and other benefit applications

Computers are available in [all our libraries](/libraries/). You can use them to make benefit applications and apply for jobs.

There is no charge for using our computers and you donâ€™t need a library card.

Computers in the library can get busy so you can book one in advance. You will need a library card to book a computer:

Universal Credit applications take 20-30 minutes for one person and about 1 hour for a couple. You can normally book a computer for 1 hour but ask staff if you think you might need longer.

Check whether you're [ready for Universal Credit](http://ucpp.dwp.gov.uk/universal-credit-preparation/Default.aspx) and read the [list of documents and information you will need](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/apply-for-universal-credit/#h-1-gather-everything-you-ll-need-to-apply) to make sure you have everything you need before you start.

### Help completing your application

Library staff can help you log-in to a computer but **they cannot help you complete the form**. If someone helps you fill in the form it could affect your application.

If you need more help or guidance use the links on the homepage of our computers and the links below.
