You can use the library to help claim benefits and get advice on work.

## Universal credit

### Using library computers for Universal Credit applications and other benefit applications

Computers are available in [all our libraries](/libraries/). You can use them to make benefit applications and apply for jobs.

There is no charge for using our computers and you don’t need a library card.

Computers in the library can get busy so you can book one in advance. You will need a library card to book a computer:

Universal Credit applications take 20-30 minutes for one person and about 1 hour for a couple. You can normally book a computer for 1 hour but ask staff if you think you might need longer.

Read the list of documents and information you will need and have everything ready before you start.

Library staff can help you log-in to a computer but they cannot help you complete the form. If someone helps you fill in the form it could affect your application.

If you need more help or guidance use the links on the homepage of our computers.
