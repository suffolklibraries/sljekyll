      <p>We have invited 10 artists from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds for a week-long residency at Ipswich County Library. During this pilot, from 30 July - 3 August, these artists will focus on engaging people aged 11-25 from all walks of life through exploration and experimentation with different media.</p>

      <p>On <strong>Thursday 2 August at 7pm</strong>, we will be holding a public event at Ipswich County Library. We will be officially launching the arts programme, unveiling its name and branding and inviting the public to meet the 10 artists in residence and hear about their practice.
