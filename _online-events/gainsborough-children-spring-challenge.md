Sign up for our Special Spring 4-Book Reading Challenge!

If you have already signed up — don’t forget to let us know what you have been reading as you go along. You can post comments and tell us what you thought about each story.

You can also email pictures you have drawn, pictures of crafts inspired by a story, videos of your story reviews or videos of your version of the story and we will post them on the library Facebook page. Our email is gainsborough.library@suffolklibraries.co.uk

Visit our page to find our sheet to record books/stories read if you have a printer. If not, just keep a note of the author and title somewhere. We will have some prizes!
