Craft your very own Elmer with Marie from Gainsborough Community Library.

March 23rd 2020 is Elmer Day! Elmer the Elephant is a multi-coloured patchwork elephant in series of bestselling children's picture books written by David McKee. Many of our libraries host events and activities for Elmer Day - and this year due to lockdown, these activities are now online.

You can access eight Elmer the Elephant stories to share with your children as part of the [Elmer Treasury eAudio collection](/elibrary/picks/2020-05-20-elmer-eaudio) on our [BorrowBox](/elibrary/borrowbox).
