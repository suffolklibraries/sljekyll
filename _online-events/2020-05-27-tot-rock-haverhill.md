Join Sarah and Rosie for another Tot Rock session. What songs will Sarah pull out of her Mary Poppins umbrella this week? Hopefully it's not her worst favourite!

**About our Wordplay sessions**
All our libraries hold regular Baby Bounce, Tot Rock and Storytime sessions for babies and young children and their parents/carers. You can hear stories, sing, move and play with toys and instruments together. The sessions are free, informal and welcoming, with no need to book in advance.

Research shows these activities are [hugely valuable to children and their parents and carers](/news/impact-report-published/), improving literacy and providing a way for adults to socialise, often in remote, rural locations in Suffolk.
