To celebrate the bedtime story and reading together, this year's Pyjamarama will be a day when families across the country can join in a festival of story-filled fun at home.

In the lead up to Friday we'll be sharing crafts, rhymes activities and fun you can print off and enjoy.

Then on Friday 1st May Charlotte will be going live on Facebook at 11.30am (as well as the usual Wordplay Baby Bounce and Tot Rock at 10.30-11.00am) in her pyjamas to read you this year's Pyjamarama book "My Pet Star" and show you some of the fun activities you can try.

So remember to join her in your PJs too!
