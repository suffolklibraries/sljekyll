Georgy started at BBC Radio Suffolk as a travel reporter in 2016, before that she was a regular contributor to various programmes on the station and has always had a passion for radio and entertainment, having acted in many local theatre plays, pantos and shows over the last 30 years.

She currently presents the Saturday show from 10-2 and also works on the Sunday morning show as producer for Sarah Lilley.

She’s a Suffolk girl born and bred and proud to be a Suffolk Chamber of Commerce Suffolk Ambassador, she’s also one of the directors of The British Comedy Society, a not for profitable organisation that exists to preserve and foster the traditions of British comedy and raise money for charitable causes.

But the most important and best thing she does is being mum to her son Taylor.
