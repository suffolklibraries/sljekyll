<cite>Don't let the pigeon drive the bus</cite> is available from our [Kanopy eLibrary service](/elibrary/kanopy/).

We'll be watching the film and chatting on our page. For more film requests or to discuss this and other films, why not join our [Kanopy Film Club Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LowLibKanopyFilmClub/)?

When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place — a pigeon! But you’ve never met one like this before.
