Listen to Amy Giddins from Woodbridge Library talk a little bit about the popularity of art books and works by one person in particular: Frida Kahlo.

Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a na√Øve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.
