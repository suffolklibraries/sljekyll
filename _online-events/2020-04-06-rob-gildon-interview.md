The Suffolk Libraries' podcast series celebrates public libraries' rebellious history as spaces for free learning and freedom of speech. We'll be delving in weekly to showcase the people we work with and offer personal insight into our guest's stories of how they broke into their industries. This episode we met with musician Rob Gildon.

Rob Gildon is an opera singer who loves to collaborate with other artists and dip his toes into other styles. He studied at Manhattan School of Music in New York, the Tanglewood and Aspen Music Festivals in America and the Britten Pears Young Artist Programme at Snape. He has worked for Garsington Opera, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, London Symphony Orchestra as well as theatre companies, Complicitie and Punchdrunk. He is passionate about educational work and regularly leads workshops for Streetwise Opera and Snape Maltings amongst others.

Suffolk Libraries is a charitable organisation which runs the county's library service. We also have a thriving arts programme generously funded by Arts Council England
