To celebrate the bedtime story and reading together, this year's Pyjamarama will be a day when families across the country can join in a festival of story-filled fun at home.

Charlotte will be in 2her pyjamas to read you this year's Pyjamarama book "My Pet Star" and show you some of the fun activities you can try.

So remember to join her in your PJs too!
