As a big Harry Potter fan, Woody (age 9) undertook this long-term Lego animation project. His original script and storyboard turned into reality with the help of his Harry Potter Lego, countless hours of stop-motion and bringing it all together. He achieved his Digital Citizen Stage 2 Cubs badge for his hard work. Well done Woody!
