Join Victoria from Woodbridge Library for another session of singing and nursery rhymes, featuring music from our Wordplay sessions for 0-5s.

## About Wordplay

All our libraries hold regular Baby Bounce, Tot Rock and Storytime sessions for babies and young children and their parents/carers. You can hear stories, sing, move and play with toys and instruments together. The sessions are free, informal and welcoming, with no need to book in advance.

Research shows [these activities are hugely valuable to children and their parents and carers](/news/impact-report-published/), improving literacy and providing a way for adults to socialise, often in remote, rural locations in Suffolk.
