CALLING ALL BUDDING WRITERS: Felixstowe Library Lockdown writing competition for children and young people

Are you aged between 5 and 18? Do you love spinning a yarn or making a whole new world of your own, creating characters and situations and adventures?

We are thrilled to announce the Felixstowe Library Lockdown Writing Competition for children and young people.

Your theme is... the seaside! Write a short story with up to 500 words inspired by or based on the seaside, the beach, the sea, the seagulls, the waves, the beach huts... the list goes on, be as creative as you like. You have until the 1st of June to create your masterpiece.

We are splitting entries into three categories:
* 7 and under
* 8 – 11
* 12 – 18

When you submit your work, please include the author’s name and their age. Our lovely staff will read through and judge all entries. There will be a runner up and a winner for each category to be announced on the 1st of July.

We will accept both typed and handwritten entries, we only ask that handwritten stories are scanned and then emailed to us. Please send in your entries to felixstowe.library@suffolklibraries.co.uk.
