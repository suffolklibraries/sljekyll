This episode we met with musician and rapper Shay D.

Hailing from the stomping grounds of North London, Shay D’s upbringing and Persian heritage remains at the core of her sound.

Establishing her name within the underground UK Hip Hop circuit, the emcee excels in the Grime & Spoken Word scenes.

An innate wordsmith, her hustle, passion and drive for music are reflected through her DIY attitude. Not only did she independently release her own album Human Writes which charted the itunes Top 20 Hip Hop chart & secured radio & Spotify playlisting, she curated the first ever all female hip hop tour in the UK, ‘Queens of Art’ in 2019 visiting 8 nationwide cities.

She has featured on BBC 1xtra Live Lounge, Redbull TV & Channel 4 as well as working on projects with Nike, Harvey Nichols, Serato and Swarovski. Shay D has performed at Southbank’s WOW Festival, Glastonbury, Shambala Festival, Milan Fashion Week, and been booked to perform in Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Belgium and Greece.
