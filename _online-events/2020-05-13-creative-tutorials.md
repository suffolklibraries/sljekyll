We are pleased to share with you Alfie Carpenter's fifth session. Alfie is an artist and musician who works with our teams at Gainsborough Community Library on our creative workshops for young people and has created a series of tutorials for Suffolk Libraries with ideas of how to reuse and recycle bits from around the house to help stay creative whilst at home.

For this session you will need:

- Pastels or paints
- Pencil
- Soil or sand  
- Glue spreader
- Glue PVA (or a homemade glue made from water and plain flour)
- Scissors
- Ruler
- Shiny materials or foil
- Some paper to work on or a sketchbook...

Artist and musician Alfie Carpenter works with paint, paper, voices, sounds and words to create songs and scenes. Based in rural Suffolk and using a mixture of plein air and studio work, Alfie’s visual art captures the distinct landscapes of East Anglia through playful and evocative collages, often using recycled scrap papers, found objects and sentimental items.  Having trained as a singer and composer, Alfie writes and performs dream-folk songscapes as well as exhibiting his art across the UK. Alfie’s musical and artistic outpourings are equally atmospheric. Whether the components are shapes, colours and textures or pitches words and voices, Alfie assembles music and art to give life to a landscape, vision or emotion.
