This episode we met with artist and musician Alfie Carpenter.

Artist and musician Alfie Carpenter works with paint, paper, voices, sounds and words to create songs and scenes. Based in rural Suffolk and using a mixture of plain air and studio work, Alfie’s visual art captures the distinct landscapes of East Anglia through playful and evocative collages, often using recycled scrap papers, found objects and sentimental items.  Having trained as a singer and composer, Alfie writes and performs dream-folk songscapes as well as exhibiting his art across the UK. Alfie’s musical and artistic outpourings are equally atmospheric. Whether the components are shapes, colours and textures or pitches words and voices, Alfie assembles music and art to give life to a landscape, vision or emotion.
