      <p>Suffolk Libraries Extra is a supporter scheme offering individuals and local businesses the chance to make an annual donation to get more involved and enhance the service Suffolk Libraries provides.</p>

      <p>You can support Suffolk Libraries by signing up at one of three price levels:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Silver - £20 per year</li>
        <li>Gold - £50 per year</li>
        <li>Platinum - £150 per year</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you'd like to help us by donating a different amount, please call us on <a href="tel:01473351249">01473 351249</a>.</p>

      <h2>How your donation will help us</h2>

      <p>Donations will go into a dedicated Development Fund which will be used to support and improve the work of our 44 libraries in their local communities.</p>

      <p>The scheme is completely voluntary. At the end of the year we’ll ask if you’d like to sign up again.</p>
