      <p>Suffolk Libraries Extra is a supporter scheme offering individuals and local businesses the chance to make an annual donation to get more involved and enhance the service Suffolk Libraries provides.</p>

      <p>You can support Suffolk Libraries by signing up at one of three price levels:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Silver - £20 per year</li>
        <li>Gold - £50 per year</li>
        <li>Platinum - £150 per year</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you'd like to help us by donating a different amount, please call us on <a href="tel:01473351249">01473 351249</a>.</p>

      <h2>How your donation will help us</h2>

      <p>Donations will go into a dedicated Development Fund which will be used to support and improve the work of our 44 libraries in their local communities.</p>

      <p>The scheme is completely voluntary. At the end of the year we’ll ask if you’d like to sign up again.</p>

        <p>All members of Suffolk Libraries Extra will get a <strong>membership card</strong> and a <strong>special newsletter</strong> with exclusive recommendations, advance notice of new library titles and exclusive offers and competitions. So far we've given away signed books by Matthew Harffy, Francesca Armour-Chelu, Lynda La Plante and Chris Riddell.</p>

        <p>Platinum level members will also have the option of <strong>attending our AGM</strong> and be <strong>acknowledged in our Annual Review</strong> next year.</p>

        <p>In the future we also hope to develop <strong>additional benefits for members</strong>.</p>

        <p>Suffolk Libraries Extra will enhance the service for all customers by funding improvements while continuing to provide the same free services and benefits. We're launching it for those who are willing and able to donate to the service.</p>
