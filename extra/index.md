Suffolk Libraries Extra has been running for two years, and we feel that it is time to review how the scheme is working to support Suffolk Libraries.

We will shortly be asking all Suffolk Libraries Extra members to answer a brief questionnaire while we conduct an internal evaluation. This review process will help to shape the future of the scheme.

For this reason, we are placing a **temporary hold on any new members signing up to Suffolk Libraries Extra** until after the review has been completed.

All current Suffolk Libraries Extra members have been contacted about the review. Current members are welcome to renew their membership during the review period by visiting their [local library](/libraries/) or [phoning or emailing us](/contact/). You can also contact the membership team at **extra@suffolklibraries.co.uk** with any questions.

Library users and members of the public can continue to [support Suffolk Libraries financially](/support-us/)  by making one-off, monthly or text donations.
