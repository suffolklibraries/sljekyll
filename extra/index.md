Suffolk Libraries Extra is a new supporter scheme offering people the chance to make an annual donation to get more involved and help the library service.

Individuals and local businesses are invited to join the scheme which will help us raise additional income to enhance the service we provide. Becoming a Suffolk Libraries Extra member will also provide you with extra benefits. 

We’ll be adding more information soon but if you’d like to know more please leave your name and email address and we’ll be in touch.
