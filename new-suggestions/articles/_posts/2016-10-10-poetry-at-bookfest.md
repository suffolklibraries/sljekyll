**Suffolk poetry fans can enjoy two evenings in the company of former Scottish Poet Laureate Liz Lochhead.  On Tuesday 25 October, she can be heard in conversation with award-winning poet Tiffany Atkinson at Beccles Library, and on Wednesday 26 October, she will be accompanied by local Celtic fusion band Aartwork at Woodbridge Library.**

<pre>No one could say the stories were useless
for as the tongue clacked
five or forty fingers stitched
corn was grated from the husk
patchwork was pieced
or the darning was done...</pre>

So goes one of Scotland's favourite literary quotes, from <cite>The Storyteller Poems</cite> by Scottish poet **Liz Lochhead**, who has recently left the post of Scots Makar - the Scottish equivalent of Poet Laureate - and last year won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. She will be reading her evocative poetry in Suffolk on two consecutive nights as part of Suffolk Libraries Bookfest.  Lochhead's work, while warm and witty, has real power and seeks to challenge the reader.  She has published 18 books since 1972.

of the windfarm, each arc of white-
through-blue reaping ohms from clean

At Beccles Library on Tuesday 25 October, Lochhead has equal billing with award-winning poet and Professor of Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia **Tiffany Atkinson**.  Both poets will perform readings and sign books, and they will also be discussing their work with library manager Ellen McAteer.  Atkinson has published three volumes of funny and moving poetry, featuring unusual imagery that offers a fresh outlook on the everyday.

At Woodbridge Library on Wednesday 26 October, Lochhead will be played in by local Celtic folk fusion band **Aartwork**.  Combining traditional Celtic style with elements of jazz and blues and liberal use of the effects pedal, while Aartwork are difficult to pin to one genre, they will undoubtedly offer a fitting warm-up for Lochhead's pin-sharp descriptions of modern Scotland.
