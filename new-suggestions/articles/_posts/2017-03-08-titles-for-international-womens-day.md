## [<cite>A Girl is a Half-formed Thing: adapted for the stage</cite>, by Eimear McBride](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2192925)

[Print novel version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1617433)

> "Eimear McBride's debut novel tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her brother after a tumour leaves him severely brain-damaged. Not so much a stream of consciousness, as an unconscious railing against a life that makes little sense, and a shocking and intimate insight into the thoughts, feelings and sensual urges of a vulnerable and isolated protagonist, to read 'A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing' is to plunge inside its narrator's head, experiencing her world first-hand. This isn't always comfortable - but it is always a revelation."

## [<cite>Agnes Grey</cite>, by Anne Brontë](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/189044)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=162980)

> "When her family becomes impoverished after a disastrous financial speculation, Agnes Grey determines to find work as a governess in order to contribute to their meagre income and assert her independence. But Agnes's enthusiasm is swiftly extinguished as she struggles first with the unmanageable Bloomfield children and then with the painful disdain of the haughty Murray family; the only kindness she receives comes from Mr Weston, the sober young curate.

> "Drawing on her own experience, Anne Brontë's first novel offers a compelling personal perspective on the desperate position of unmarried, educated women for whom becoming a governess was the only respectable career open in Victorian society."

## [<cite>Wolf Hall</cite> and <cite>Bring Up the Bodies</cite>, by Hilary Mantel](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1091351)

[Print version of <cite>Wolf Hall</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=78790)

[Print version of <cite>Bring Up the Bodies</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1303548)

> "Through the eyes and ears of Thomas Cromwell, these books' narrative prism, we are shown Tudor England, the court of King Henry VIII. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events.

> "In <cite>Wolf Hall</cite> we witness Cromwell's rise, beginning as clerk to Cardinal Wolsey, Henry's chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. He is soon to become his successor.

> "By 1535, when the action of <cite>Bring Up the Bodies</cite> begins, Cromwell is Chief Minister to Henry, his fortunes having risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry's second wife. Anne's days, though, are marked. Cromwell watches as the king falls in love with silent, plain Jane Seymour, sensing what Henry's affection will mean for his queen, for England, and for himself.

## [<cite>The Bell Jar</cite>, by Sylvia Plath](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/202256)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1296492)

> "'I was supposed to be having the time of my life.'

> "When Esther Greenwood wins an internship on a New York fashion magazine in 1953, she is elated, believing she will finally realise her dream to become a writer. But in between the cocktail parties and piles of manuscripts, Esther's life begins to slide out of control. She finds herself spiralling into depression and eventually a suicide attempt, as she grapples with difficult relationships and a society which refuses to take women's aspirations seriously.

> <cite>The Bell Jar</cite>, Sylvia Plath's only novel, was originally published in 1963 under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas. The novel is partially based on Plath's own life and descent into mental illness, and has become a modern classic. <cite>The Bell Jar</cite> has been celebrated for its darkly funny and razor sharp portrait of 1950s society and has sold millions of copies worldwide."

## [<cite>Lila</cite>, by Marilynne Robinson - audiobook](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1948330)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1656686)

> "Lila, homeless and alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town Iowa church — the only available shelter from the rain — and ignites a romance and a debate that will reshape her life.

> "She becomes the wife of a minister, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense of the life that preceded her newfound security. Neglected as a toddler, Lila was rescued by Doll, a canny young drifter, and brought up by her in a hardscrabble childhood. Together they crafted a life on the run, living hand to mouth with nothing but their sisterly bond and a ragged blade to protect them. Despite bouts of petty violence and moments of desperation, their shared life was laced with moments of joy and love.

> "When Lila arrives in Gilead, she struggles to reconcile the life of her makeshift family and their days of hardship with the gentle Christian worldview of her husband which paradoxically judges those she loves."

## [<cite>Love</cite>, by Toni Morrison](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/212592)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=225880)

> "May, Christine, Heed, Junior, Vida – even L – all are women obsessed with Bill Cosey. He shapes their yearnings for a father, husband, lover, guardian, and friend.

> "This audacious vision from a master storyteller on the nature of love – its appetite, its sublime possession, and its consuming dread – is rich in characters and dramatic events, and in its profound sensitivity to just how alive the past can be. Sensual, elegiac and unforgettable, <cite>Love</cite> ultimately comes full circle to that indelible, overwhelming first love that marks us forever."

## [<cite>The Gap of Time</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2385918)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1832471)

> "A baby girl is abandoned, banished from London to the storm-ravaged American city of New Bohemia. Her father has been driven mad by jealousy, her mother to exile by grief.

> "Seventeen years later, Perdita doesn't know a lot about who she is or where she's come from - but she's about to find out.

> "Jeanette Winterson's cover version of <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite> vibrates with echoes of Shakespeare's original and tells a story of hearts broken and hearts healed, a story of revenge and forgiveness, a story that shows that whatever is lost shall be found."

## [<cite>The Heart of a Woman</cite> by Maya Angelou - audiobook](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/193514)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=354069)

> "Maya Angelou has fascinated, moved, and inspired countless readers with the first three volumes of her autobiography, one of the most remarkable personal narratives of our age. Now, in her fourth volume, <cite>The Heart of a Woman</cite>, her turbulent life breaks wide open with joy as the singer-dancer enters the razzle-dazzle of fabulous New York City. There, at the Harlem Writers Guild, her love for writing blazes anew.

> "Her compassion and commitment lead her to respond to the fiery times by becoming the northern coordinator of Martin Luther King's history-making quest. A tempestuous, earthy woman, she promises her heart to one man only to have it stolen, virtually on her wedding day, by a passionate African freedom fighter.

> "Filled with unforgettable vignettes of famous characters, from Billie Holiday to Malcolm X, <cite>The Heart of a Woman</cite> sings with Maya Angelou's eloquent prose — her fondest dreams, deepest disappointments, and her dramatically tender relationship with her rebellious teenage son. Vulnerable, humorous, tough, Maya speaks with an intimate awareness of the heart within all of us."

## [<cite>My Brilliant Friend</cite>, by Elena Ferrante - audiobook](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2083863)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1721712)

> "A modern masterpiece from one of Italy's most acclaimed authors, <cite>My Brilliant Friend</cite> is a rich, intense, and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila, who represent the story of a nation and the nature of friendship.

> "The story begins in the 1950s in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Growing up on these tough streets, the two girls learn to rely on each other ahead of anyone or anything else. As they grow — and as their paths repeatedly diverge and converge — Elena and Lila remain best friends whose respective destinies are reflected and refracted in the other. They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists."

## [<cite>The Gustav Sonata</cite>, by Rose Tremain](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2711325)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093155)

> "Gustav grows up in a small town in Switzerland, where the horrors of the Second World War seem a distant echo. But Gustav's father has mysteriously died, and his adored mother Emilie is strangely cold and indifferent to him. Gustav's life is a lonely one until he meets Anton. An intense lifelong friendship develops but Anton fails to understand how deeply and irrevocably his life and Gustav's are entwined until it is almost too late..."

## [<cite>Swing Time</cite>, by Zadie Smith](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2640838)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2057070)

> "Two brown girls dream of being dancers - but only one, Tracey, has talent. The other has ideas: about rhythm and time, about black bodies and black music, what constitutes a tribe, or makes a person truly free. It's a close but complicated childhood friendship that ends abruptly in their early twenties, never to be revisited, but never quite forgotten, either...

> "Dazzlingly energetic and deeply human, Swing Time is a story about friendship and music and stubborn roots, about how we are shaped by these things and how we can survive them. Moving from north-west London to West Africa, it is an exuberant dance to the music of time."

## [<cite>Autumn</cite>, by Ali Smith](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2617316)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2016062)

> "Autumn. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. That's what it felt like for Keats in 1819.

> "How about Autumn 2016?

> "Daniel is a century old. Elisabeth, born in 1984, has her eye on the future. The United Kingdom is in pieces, divided by a historic once-in-a-generation summer.

> "Love is won, love is lost. Hope is hand in hand with hopelessness. The seasons roll round, as ever.

> "Ali Smith's new novel is a meditation on a world growing ever more bordered and exclusive, on what richness and worth are, on what harvest means. This first in a seasonal quartet casts an eye over our own time. Who are we? What are we made of? Shakespearian jeu d'esprit, Keatsian melancholy, the sheer bright energy of 1960s pop art: the centuries cast their eyes over our own history-making.

> "Here's where we're living. Here's time at its most contemporaneous and its most cyclic."

## [<cite>Sculptor's Daughter</cite>, by Tove Jansson](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1439361)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1479512)

> "Tove Jansson's first book for adults was a memoir, capturing afresh the enchantments and fears of her Helsinki childhood.

> "Presented with images from her family archive, Sculptor's Daughter gives us a glimpse of the mysteries of winter ice, the bonhomie of balalaika parties, and the vastness of Christmas viewed from beneath the tree.

> "Tove Jansson (1914–2001) is best known as the creator of the much loved Moomin stories for children. However, in her fifties she turned her attention to writing for adults, producing a dozen novels and story collections."

## [<cite>Nights at the Circus</cite>, by Angela Carter](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/491694)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=215108)

> "Is Sophie Fevvers, toast of Europe's capitals, part swan ... or all fake?

> "Courted by the Prince of Wales and painted by Toulouse-Lautrec, she is an aerialiste extraordinaire and star of Colonel Kearney's circus. She is also part woman, part swan. Jack Walser, an American journalist, is on a quest to discover the truth behind her identity. Dazzled by his love for her, and desperate for the scoop of a lifetime, Walser has no choice but to join the circus on its magical tour through turn-of-the-nineteenth-century London, St Petersburg and Siberia."

## [<cite>The Cleft</cite>, by Doris Lessing](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/191394)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=79458)

> "Doris Lessing, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, invites us to imagine a mythical society free from sexual intrigue, free from jealousy, free from petty rivalries: a society free from men.

> "An old Roman senator embarks on what may be his last endeavour: the retelling of the story of human creation. He recounts the history of the Clefts, an ancient community of women living in an Edenic, coastal wilderness, in the valley of an overshadowing mountain. The Clefts have no need, or knowledge, of men – childbirth is controlled through the cycles of the moon, and their children are always female. But with the birth of a strange, new child – a boy – the harmony of their community is thrown into jeopardy.

> "At first, the Clefts are awestruck by this seemingly malformed child, but as more and more of these threateningly unfamiliar males appear, they are rejected, and are exposed on the nearby mountainside, sacrificed to the patrolling eagles overhead. Unbeknownst to the Clefts, however, these baby males survive, aided by the eagles, and thrive on the other side of the mountain. It is not until a curious young Cleft named Maire goes beyond the geographical, and emotional, divide of the mountain that this disquieting fact is uncovered – forcing the Clefts to accept the prospect of a now shared world, and the possible vengeance of the wronged males."

## [<cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>, by Harper Lee](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1743789)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=245632)

> "'Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'

> "A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the thirties. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

> <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite> is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition."

## [<cite>Go Set a Watchman</cite>, by Harper Lee](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2111726)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1763072)

> "Maycomb, Alabama. 26-year-old Jean Louise Finch – 'Scout' – returns home from New York City to visit her ageing father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt.

> "Featuring many of the iconic characters from <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>, <cite>Go Set a Watchman</cite> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past – a journey that can be guided only by one's own conscience."

## [<cite>To the Lighthouse</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/189663)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=247616)

> "This novel is an extraordinarily poignant evocation of a lost happiness that lives on in the memory. For years now the Ramsays have spent every summer in their holiday home in Scotland, and they expect these summers will go on forever.

> "In this, her most autobiographical novel, Virginia Woolf captures the intensity of childhood longing and delight, and the shifting complexity of adult relationships. From an acute awareness of transience, she creates an enduring work of art."

## [<cite>The Handmaid's Tale</cite>, by Margaret Atwood - audiobook](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/564480)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=237069)

> "The Republic of Gilead offers Offred only one function - to breed. If she deviates, she will be killed. But even an oppressive state cannot obliterate desire - neither Offred's nor that of the two men on which her future hangs."

## [<cite>Selected Poems</cite>, by Stevie Smith](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/189819)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=52149)

> "Stevie Smith was one of the few modern poets to reach a wide general audience. Bizarre, witty, sad, sometimes caustic, her poems impart a zest for life, and reveal her unique eye for the marvels of the ordinary and her deep sensibility to the paradoxical nature of all human emotions."

## [<cite>How to Be a Woman</cite>, by Caitlin Moran](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3036494)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=198924)

> "It's a good time to be a woman: we have the vote and the Pill, and we haven't been burnt as witches since 1727. However, a few nagging questions do remain...

> "Why are we supposed to get Brazilians? Should we use Botox? Do men secretly hate us? And why does everyone ask you when you're going to have a baby?

> "Part memoir, part rant, Caitlin answers the questions that every modern woman is asking."

## [<cite>Animal: the autobiography of a female body</cite>, by Sara Pascoe](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2637690)

[Print version](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1959236)

> "Sara Pascoe is a comedian who has talked and joked about female sexuality, psychology and the media's portrayal of women on stage and screen. In this book, Sara combines autobiography and evolutionary history to entertain and inform about the female body."
