## CD audiobooks

### [<cite>Turbo Twenty Three</cite>, by Janet Evanovich, read by Lorelei King](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204284)

> "A killer is out to make sure someone gets his just desserts. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has been on countless crime scenes, but this is definitely a first. Her fleeing target has left behind a truck loaded with ice cream and a dead body - frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans.

> "As fate would have it, Stephanie's mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the ice cream factory to find out who's killing employees and sabotaging the business. It's going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It's also going to be hard to explain to Trenton's hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger."

### [<cite>Frost at Midnight</cite>, by James Henry, read by Stephen Thorne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204279)

> "August, 1983: Denton is preparing for a wedding. Detective Sergeant Waters should be on top of the world with less than a week to go until he marries Kim Myles. But the Sunday before the big day, instead of a run-through with his best man, the church is sealed off. The body of a young woman has been found in the churchyard, and their idyllic wedding venue has become a crime scene."

### [<cite>Hiding in Plain Sight</cite>, by Susan Lewis, read by Julia Franklin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204281)

> "Andee Lawrence is in heaven. Well, the South of France to be exact. Ex-detective Andee has swapped freelance investigation and a broken marriage for two months in Provence, renovating a beautiful villa with the new man in her life. Pottering around a small picturesque town on an early summer's day, she is at peace. But her world is about to be shattered.

> "Remember me? Two words spoken by a woman from the back of a car that say so much yet reveal so little. As the car drives away Andee is left reeling, overwhelmed by shock, confusion, self-doubt and mounting trepidation. Almost 30 years ago, 14-year-old Penny had disappeared from her family's life, never to be heard from again. It is the missing child case that has haunted Andee her whole life; and now Penny - Andee's sister - is back. The question is: why?"

### [<cite>Don't Tell</cite>, by Karen Rose, read by Jeff Harding](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204286)

> "Having suffered at the hands of her abusive husband long enough, Mary Grace Winters concocts a risky survival plan. She drives her car into a lake to fake her and her son's death, changes their names, and relocates to a small university town far away."

### [<cite>A Compromising Position</cite>, by Carole Matthews, read by Julie Maisey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204283)

> "When Emily's boyfriend posts compromising photos of her on the Internet, her life goes into sharp decline. She is about to lose everything - including the man she thought she loved. Her best friend, Cara, is determined to mend Emily's broken heart and she believes that a little magic is all that's required."

### [<cite>Crime Scene</cite>, by Jonathan & Jesse Kellerman, read by Robert G. Slade](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204285)

> "Responding to a call at a mansion in an East Bay neighbourhood, Deputy Coroner Clay Edison comes upon the body of Dr Walter Rennert, a controversial Berkeley psychologist, sprawled at the foot of his stairs. There are no wounds and no signs of intrusion or struggle.

> "Clay knows the obvious diagnosis is natural death. But ten years ago, Rennert's partner was found dead and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Tatiana, Rennert's daughter, will not let the case lie. She knows her father has been murdered. It is not part of Clay's job description to investigate crimes, but he is enthralled by Tatiana, drawn in to her twisted, alternate world. His investigation drives him deep into the dark heart of a long-buried scandal, and it won't be long until he is forced to question where his true loyalties lie."

### [<cite>Shelter</cite>, by Sarah Franklin, read by Imogen Church](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204280)

> "It's 1944 and Connie is a trainee 'lumberjill'. She's been transferred from blitzed Coventry to the Forest of Dean to learn the lumberjack trade as one of the women forming the backbone of Britain's war effort. She's nursing a huge secret and running from her tragic past, and will soon have to make a life-changing decision.

> "Women like Connie are finding opportunity and liberty like never before, but in this explosive moment of history everything is changing for women - and nothing is changing. Then, as now, is the price Connie must pay for her freedom too great?"

### [<cite>White Fang</cite>, by Jack London, read by John Lee](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/109796)

> "In the desolate, frozen wilds of northwest Canada, a wolf cub finds himself the sole survivor of his litter. Son of Kiche, half-wolf, half-dog, and the ageing wolf One Eye, he is thrust into a savage world where each day renews the struggle of survival. It is a lonely but noble life—until the day he is captured by dog-driving men. The cruel mistreatment he bears in this new life of slavery teaches him to hate.

> "Only one man sees beyond the rage of White Fang to his intelligence and dignity. Only one has the courage to offer the killer a new life. But can his kindness reach the heart of White Fang?"

### [<cite>Skulduggery Pleasant: playing with fire</cite>, by Derek Landy, read by RUpert Degas](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/1121031)

> "Just when you think you’ve saved the world...

> ""You will kill her?" the Torment asked. Skulduggery sagged. "Yes." He hesitated, then took his gun from his jacket. "I'm sorry, Valkyrie," he said softly. "Don't talk to me," Valkyrie said. "Just do what you have to do." Valkyrie parted her tunic, and Skulduggery pointed the gun at the vest beneath. "Please forgive me," Skulduggery said, then aimed the gun at the girl and pulled the trigger.

> "With Serpine dead, the world is safe once more. At least, that’s what Valkyrie and Skulduggery think, until the notorious Baron Vengeous makes a bloody escape from prison, and dead bodies and vampires start showing up all over Ireland. With Baron Vengeous after the deadly armour of Lord Vile, and pretty much everyone out to kill Valkyrie, the daring detective duo face their biggest challenge yet. But what if the greatest threat to Valkyrie is just a little closer to home?"

### [<cite>Slightly Sinful</cite>, by Mary Balogh, read by Rosalyn Landor](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3212723)

> "Injured on the battlefield, Lord Alleyne Bedwyn awakens in a ladies' brothel, with no memory of who he is, in the care of the lovely Rachel York, who decides to use the dashing soldier she rescued to try to reclaim her stolen fortune."

### [<cite>The Nine Tailors</cite>, by Dorothy L. Sayers, read by Ian Carmichael](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/92612)

> "Storm-bound over the New Year at a Fenland rectory, Lord Peter Wimsey willingly lends a hand in the ringing of a New Year's Eve peal of the church bells. Some months later, a handless, disfigured corpse is discovered in a fresh grave in the churchyard. Lord Peter receives a plea for help from the rector and embarks on one of his most complicated investigations - for this is not the first crime the village has experienced. Fifteen years ago the Wilbraham Emeralds were stolen, and they are still missing. Can there be any link?"
