## CD audiobooks

### [<cite>Turbo Twenty Three</cite>, by Janet Evanovich, read by Lorelei King](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204284)

> "A killer is out to make sure someone gets his just desserts. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has been on countless crime scenes, but this is definitely a first. Her fleeing target has left behind a truck loaded with ice cream and a dead body - frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans.

> "As fate would have it, Stephanie's mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the ice cream factory to find out who's killing employees and sabotaging the business. It's going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It's also going to be hard to explain to Trenton's hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger."

### [<cite>Frost at Midnight</cite>, by James Henry, read by Stephen Thorne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204279)

> "August, 1983: Denton is preparing for a wedding. Detective Sergeant Waters should be on top of the world with less than a week to go until he marries Kim Myles. But the Sunday before the big day, instead of a run-through with his best man, the church is sealed off. The body of a young woman has been found in the churchyard, and their idyllic wedding venue has become a crime scene."

### [<cite>Hiding in Plain Sight</cite>, by Susan Lewis, read by Julia Franklin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204281)

> "Andee Lawrence is in heaven. Well, the South of France to be exact. Ex-detective Andee has swapped freelance investigation and a broken marriage for two months in Provence, renovating a beautiful villa with the new man in her life. Pottering around a small picturesque town on an early summer's day, she is at peace. But her world is about to be shattered.

> "Remember me? Two words spoken by a woman from the back of a car that say so much yet reveal so little. As the car drives away Andee is left reeling, overwhelmed by shock, confusion, self-doubt and mounting trepidation. Almost 30 years ago, 14-year-old Penny had disappeared from her family's life, never to be heard from again. It is the missing child case that has haunted Andee her whole life; and now Penny - Andee's sister - is back. The question is: why?"

### [<cite>Don't Tell</cite>, by Karen Rose, read by Jeff Harding](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204286)

### [<cite>A Compromising Position</cite>, by Carole Matthews, read by Julie Maisey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204283)

> "When Emily's boyfriend posts compromising photos of her on the Internet, her life goes into sharp decline. She is about to lose everything - including the man she thought she loved. Her best friend, Cara, is determined to mend Emily's broken heart and she believes that a little magic is all that's required."

### [<cite>Crime Scene</cite>, by Jonathan & Jesse Kellerman, read by Robert G. Slade](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204285)

> "Responding to a call at a mansion in an East Bay neighbourhood, Deputy Coroner Clay Edison comes upon the body of Dr Walter Rennert, a controversial Berkeley psychologist, sprawled at the foot of his stairs. There are no wounds and no signs of intrusion or struggle.

> "Clay knows the obvious diagnosis is natural death. But ten years ago, Rennert's partner was found dead and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Tatiana, Rennert's daughter, will not let the case lie. She knows her father has been murdered. It is not part of Clay's job description to investigate crimes, but he is enthralled by Tatiana, drawn in to her twisted, alternate world. His investigation drives him deep into the dark heart of a long-buried scandal, and it won't be long until he is forced to question where his true loyalties lie."

### [<cite>Shelter</cite>, by Sarah Franklin, read by Imogen Church](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2204280)

She's been transferred from blitzed Coventry to the Forest of Dean to learn the lumberjack trade as one of the women forming the backbone of Britain's war effort. She's nursing a huge secret and running from her tragic past, and will soon have to make a life-changing decision.

> "Women like Connie are finding opportunity and liberty like never before, but in this explosive moment of history everything is changing for women - and nothing is changing. Then, as now, is the price Connie must pay for her freedom too great?"

### [<cite>The Secrets She Keeps</cite> by Michael Robotham, read by Lucy Price-Lewis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252791)

> "Everyone has an idea of what their perfect life is. For Agatha, it's Meghan Shaughnessy's. At least, that's how Agatha sees it. There is one thing they have in common: both have buried dangerous secrets they will go to terrible lengths to keep. And soon both will realise just how far from perfect their lives can be. All it takes is one haunting lie that cannot be undone."

### [<cite>The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye</cite>, by David Lagercrantz, read by Saul Reichlin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2253712)

### [<cite>Lillian Boxfish Takes a Walk</cite>, by Kathleen Rooney, read by Xe Sands](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_418523&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "'In my reckless and undiscouraged youth,' Lillian Boxfish writes, 'I worked in a walnut-paneled office thirteen floors above West Thirty-Fifth Street...'

> "She took 1930s New York by storm, working her way up writing copy for R.H. Macy’s to become the highest paid advertising woman in the country. It was a job that, she says, 'in some ways saved my life, and in other ways ruined it.'

> "Now it’s the last night of 1984 and Lillian, 85 years old but just as sharp and savvy as ever, is on her way to a party. It’s chilly enough out for her mink coat and Manhattan is grittier now – her son keeps warning her about a subway vigilante on the prowl – but the quick-tongued poetess has never been one to scare easily. On a walk that takes her over 10 miles around the city, she meets bartenders, bodega clerks, security guards, criminals, children, parents and parents-to-be, while reviewing a life of excitement and adversity, passion and heartbreak, illuminating all the ways New York has changed – and has not."

### [<cite>Proof of Life</cite>, by J. A. Jance, read by Alan Sklar](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=HCA_435720&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Before he retired, J. P. Beaumont had looked forward to having his days all to himself. But too much free time doesn’t suit a man used to brushing close to danger. When his longtime nemesis, retired Seattle crime reporter Maxwell Cole, dies in what’s officially deemed to be an accidental fire, Beau is astonished to be dragged into the investigation at the request of none other than the deceased victim himself. In the process Beau learns that just because a long-ago case was solved doesn’t mean it’s over.

> "Caught up in a situation where old actions and grudges can hold dangerous consequences in the present, Beau is forced to operate outside the familiar world of law enforcement. While seeking justice for his frenemy and healing for a long fractured family, he comes face to face with an implacable enemy who has spent decades hiding in plain sight."

### [<cite>The House of Unexpected Sisters</cite>, by Alexander McCall Smith, read by Adjoa Andoh](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_442819&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "The latest instalment of the irresistibly charming, perennially bestselling No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.

> "Precious Ramotswe has always idolised her father, the late Obed Ramotswe. She feels that she knows all about his life – but does she? Sometimes our parents surprise us, and we discover that things were not quite what we thought them to be. And the same goes for Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's feisty assistant, who also makes certain discoveries about her own past that cause some surprise.

> "The placid world of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is further disturbed by the arrival in Gaborone of somebody whom Mma Ramotswe – and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, for that matter – definitely do not want to see. Of course calm eventually prevails - as it always does in the timeless world of these remarkable ladies."
