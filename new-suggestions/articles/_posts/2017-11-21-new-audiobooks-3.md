### [<cite>Pussy</cite>, by Howard Jacobson, read by Mike Grady](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252799)

> "<cite>Pussy</cite> is the story of Prince Fracassus, heir presumptive to the Duchy of Origen, famed for its golden-gated skyscrapers and casinos, who passes his boyhood watching reality shows on TV, imagining himself to be the Roman Emperor Nero and fantasising about hookers. He is idle, boastful, thin-skinned and egotistic; has no manners, no curiosity, no knowledge, no idea and no words in which to express them. Could he, in that case, be the very leader to make the country great again?"

### [<cite>Persons Unknown</cite>, by Susie Steiner, read by Juanita McMahon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252691)

> "As dusk falls a young man staggers through a park, far from home, bleeding heavily from a stab wound. He dies where he falls; cradled by a stranger, a woman's name on his lips in his last seconds of life.

> "DI Manon Bradshaw can't help taking an interest - these days she only handles cold cases, but the man died just yards from the police station where she works. She's horrified to discover that both victim and prime suspect are more closely linked to her than she could have imagined. And as the Cambridgeshire police force closes ranks against her, she is forced to contemplate the unthinkable. How well does she know her loved ones, and are they capable of murder?"

### [<cite>The Break</cite>, by Marian Keyes, read by Aoife McMahon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252815)

> "The story of a relationship that everyone thought was forever and which is now in danger of being for never, <cite>The Break</cite> is about getting older and staying in love when life, real life, is trying to pull you apart."

### [<cite>After Me Comes the Flood</cite>, by Sarah Perry, read by Leighton Pugh](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252822)

> "One hot summer's day, John Cole decides to leave his life behind. He shuts up the bookshop no one ever comes to and drives out of London. When his car breaks down and he becomes lost on an isolated road, he goes looking for help, and stumbles into the grounds of a grand but dilapidated house. Its residents welcome him with open arms - but there's more to this strange community than meets the eye. They all know him by name, they've prepared a room for him, and claim to have been waiting for him all along.

> "As nights and days pass John finds himself drawn into a baffling menagerie. There is Hester, their matriarchal, controlling host; Alex and Claire, siblings full of child-like wonder and delusions; the mercurial Eve; Elijah - a faithless former preacher haunted by the Bible; and chain-smoking Walker, wreathed in smoke and hostility. Who are these people? And what do they intend for John?"

### [<cite>The Underground Railroad</cite>, by Colson Whitehead, read by Bahni Turpin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2306671)

> "Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. All the slaves lead a hellish existence, but Cora has it worse than most; she is an outcast even among her fellow Africans and she is approaching womanhood, where it is clear even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a slave recently arrived from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they take the perilous decision to escape to the North.

> "In Whitehead's razor-sharp imagining of the antebellum South, the Underground Railroad has assumed a physical form: a dilapidated box car pulled along subterranean tracks by a steam locomotive, picking up fugitives wherever it can."

### [<cite>The Babylon Idol</cite>, by Scott Mariani, read by Colin Mace](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252680)

> "When a sniper leaves Ben Hope's friend fighting for his life, the former SAS major declares war on the men responsible. But what begins as a straightforward revenge mission gets complicated when a mysterious letter reveals Ben to be the real target. And his isn't the only name on a crazed killer's list. Professor Anna Manzini has no idea she's in grave danger from a man she'd thought dead. She's on the cusp of a major discovery: the location of the lost Babylon idol, a golden statue of immeasurable value.

> "But when word of Anna's work reaches her enemies, it sets off a cat-and-mouse chase that will lead Ben and Anna halfway across Europe and into the heart of war-torn Syria. To reach the precious idol first, Ben must keep one step ahead of a powerful maniac. If he fails, it won't just be Ben and Anna's lives in danger, but the world."

### [<cite>I Am Behind You</cite>, by John Ajvide Lindqvist, translated by Marlaine Delargy, read by Peter Noble](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2253707)

> "Molly wakes her mother to go to the toilet. The campsite is strangely blank. The toilet block has gone. Everything else has gone too. This is a place with no sun. No god. Just four families remain. Each has done something to bring them here - each denies they deserve it. Until they see what's coming over the horizon, moving irrevocably towards them. Their worst mistake. Their darkest fear. And for just one of them, their homecoming."

### [<cite>The Force</cite>, by Dan Winslow, read by Dion Graham](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252769)

> "Detective sergeant Denny Malone leads an elite unit to fight gangs, drugs and guns. For 18 years he's been on the front lines, doing whatever it takes to survive in a city built by ambition and corruption, where no one is clean - including Malone himself.

> "What only a few know is that Denny Malone is dirty: he and his partners have stolen millions of dollars in drugs and cash. Now he's caught in a trap and being squeezed by the Feds, and he must walk a thin line of betrayal, while the city teeters on the brink of a racial conflagration that could destroy them all."

### [<cite>The Boy Who Saw</cite>, by Simon Toyne, read by Joseph Balderrama](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252771)

> "'Finishing what was begun.' This is the message written in blood beside the body of an elderly tailor who has been tortured and murdered in the ancient town of Cordes. Hours before his death he had left a cryptic message for his granddaughter and her young son, Leo - one that puts them in immediate danger. The mother and her child are forced to go on the run, accompanied by the enigmatic Solomon Creed - a man found at the scene of the crime with no proper identification, no memory, only a strange belief that he is there to rescue Leo."

### [<cite>The Cows</cite>, by Dawn O'Porter, read by Karen Cass & Laura Kirman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252773)

> "Tara, Cam and Stella are strangers living their own lives as best they can - though when society's screaming you should live life one way, it can be hard to like what you see in the mirror. When an extraordinary event ties invisible bonds of friendship between them, one woman's catastrophe becomes another's inspiration and a life lesson to all. Sometimes it's OK not to follow the herd."

### [<cite>A Summer Revenge</cite>, by Tom Callaghan, read by Saul Reichlin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252775)

Then the Minister of State Security promises Akyl his old life back - if Akyl finds his vanished mistress. The beautiful Natasha Sulonbekova has disappeared in Dubai with information that could destroy the Minister's career.

> "But when Borubaev arrives in Dubai - straight into a scene of horrific carnage - he learns that what Natasha is carrying is worth far more than a damaged reputation."

### [<cite>The Dark Net</cite>, by Benjamin Percy, read by David Chandler](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252777)

> "The dark net is an online shadowland for criminals to operate anonymously, but when a demonic force begins to hack the minds of its users there is nowhere left to hide. With an unstoppable virus spreading throughout the net and an ancient evil threatening to break lose on the real world, it falls to four apparently random strangers to stop the rising darkness."

### [<cite>The Darkness Within</cite>, by Lisa Stone, read by Jilly Bond](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2252695)

He's been hired by a wealthy man in the record industry who claims quite a story — a seven-foot-tall, green-eyed, scythe-wielding monster is on his tail. Dirk pretends to understand the man's ravings involving potatoes and a contract signed in blood coming due; when in reality, he is absorbed in thought ... what might he do if he actually receives payment for his "services" — he could get rid of the refrigerator, which is so filthy inside that it has become the centrepiece of a showdown between himself and his cleaning woman.

> "Dirk only comes to realize the man was truly in dire straits when he arrives late for a meeting at the man's estate. The perimeter is swarming with police and inside, in a heavily barricaded room, lies his client with his head neatly removed and spinning several feet away on a turntable. Feeling guilty about not taking the guy seriously, Dirk stays on the case and confronts exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of Norse mythology, insulting horoscopes, a sinister nursing home, an I Ching calculator, an omnipotent being who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive (in exchange for clean linen), and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't get pizza delivered in London."
