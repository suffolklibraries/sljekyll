## [<cite>Running for My Life: my 26.2 mile journey to health and happiness</cite>, by Rachel Cullen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2305206)

> "Suffering from bipolar disorder, and hungry for approval at any price, Rachel Cullen's life was defined by failed relationships, an ill-fitting career and poor health to match.

> "Stuck in an endless cycle of disappointment, and not knowing how to handle her mental illness, she put on a pair of old trainers. She'd never been able to think of herself as a 'runner', and the first time she forced herself out the door, she knew it would hurt. She just didn't realise how much it would heal her, too.

> "<cite>Running for my Life</cite> will make you laugh, cry and question whether you really can outrun your demons."

## [<cite>When to Jump: if the job you have isn't the life you want</cite>, by Mike Lewis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2309986)

As new year is a time when many people decide to change jobs:

> "Do you have a little voice in your head telling you to pursue the thing you love? Leaving a comfortable job to pursue a passion is a brave, bold move - but it's far from impossible.

> "In this inspiring read, Mike Lewis has curated a community of people to share their stories about taking the leap into the unknown - people from all walks of life who left the safe inertia of their own circumstances to try and do what they really wanted to be doing. These are empowering, compelling tales about taking risks and embracing fear."

## [<cite>The Art of Discarding: how to get rid of clutter and find joy</cite>, by Nagisa Tatsumi, translated by Angus Turvill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2310620)

Start the new year with a satisfying clear-out:

> "A combination of tiny homes and a love of stylish homeware has left Japanese people hungry for advice on organisation, decluttering and tidying up. Indeed, in this era of mass consumption, we are all drowning in 'stuff', despite our best efforts to keep on top of the clutter that collects in our homes, our office spaces and even our cars.

> "Enter Nagisa Tatsumi and her bold suggestion - that it's OK to throw stuff away. Tatsumi argues that we need to learn to let go, and tackles head-on the psychological issues that people have with getting rid of things, in particular a reluctance to discard things 'just in case', the desire to hoard things, and guilt about getting rid of things that were given as gifts."

> "At 27, Maggy had the worst mental experience of her life so far. She ended a three-year relationship, drank too much, went to A&E over 12 times, saw three therapists, went to two burns units for self-harm and was sent to a mental health crisis team in an ambulance - it was quite the year.

Beautifully written, hilarious and heartbreaking, Maggy's story will offer comfort and hope to millions of people."
