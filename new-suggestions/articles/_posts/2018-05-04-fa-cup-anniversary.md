## [<cite>On the Map: Sir Bobby Robson: the Ipswich Town years</cite>, by Nick Fuller](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=553095)

He also remembers epic incidents from the 'Hand of God' to the tears of Gazza."

By 2009 Bobby Robson had left Ipswich and gone on to success with England and in Europe. This autobiography covers his later career but also touches on his time at Ipswich Town.
