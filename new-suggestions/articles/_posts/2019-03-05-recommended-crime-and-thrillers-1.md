> "Leo Stanhope. Avid chess player; assistant to a London coroner; in love with Maria; and hiding a very big secret. For Leo was born Charlotte, the daughter of a respectable reverend. But knowing he was meant to be a man - despite the evidence of his body - and unable to cope with living a lie any longer, he fled his family home at just 15 and has been living as Leo: his secret known to only a few trusted people.

> "But then Maria is found dead and Leo is accused of her murder. Desperate to find her killer and under suspicion from all those around him, he stands to lose not just the woman he loves, but his freedom and, ultimately, his life."

> "In the midst of one of the worst winters Chicago has seen in years, the body of missing teenager Ella Reynolds is discovered under the surface of a frozen lake. She's been missing for three weeks - the lake froze over three months ago. Detective Sam Porter and his team are brought in to investigate but it's not long before another girl goes missing.

> "The press believes the serial killer, Anson Bishop, has struck again but Porter knows differently. The deaths are too different, there's a new killer on the loose. Porter however is distracted. He's still haunted by Bishop and his victims, even after the FBI have removed him from the case.

> "As more girls go missing and Porter's team race to stop the body count rising, Porter disappears to track down Bishop's mother and discover that the only place scarier than the mind of a serial killer is the mind of the mother from which he came."

> "Local journalist Luke Harding is determined to warn the public. As the person who covered the arrest and trial all those years ago, he knows the kind of predator Craig really is.

> "Luke's worst fears are realised after a girl goes missing days after Craig's release and he becomes obsessed with trying to prove that Craig was behind it. Erica is worried too - but how can a mother turn her back on her son? And how far will she go to protect him?"

> "The day Sophie McCarthy met Aidan Ryan changed everything for her. One tragic, violent act left her hospitalised, hanging by a thread.

On Christmas Eve, a police officer goes missing and his colleagues can't help but anticipate the worst. Their concerns are validated when eventually a body is found, with the victim apparently stoned to death.

> "As tensions rise, it's up to Charlie and his team to venture into the city's cold underbelly to try and find an answer to the madness."

Even more curiously, when Marcia Tredgold gets Bea alone, she asks her to find out who killed her two cats.

> "Bea resists becoming involved in the strange goings-on at the Tredgold mansion, until a shocking event leads her to worry about Marcia's safety. Could the cats' deaths be linked to other disturbing events? And whose account can be trusted in the web of secrets and lies which has been spun around the family? In her quest to uncover the truth, Bea's own safety is put at risk."

A killer is carving out the hearts of his victims, and depositing the stolen organs alongside the headstones of existing graves. Accompanying each heart is a cryptic letter, signed by a 'Mr Brokenhearts'. There is one more intriguing aspect to Mr Brokenhearts' macabre modus operandi: the chosen graves all belong to women who have committed suicide.

> "As he searches for the connection between the old suicides and the new murders, Pendergast realises the brutal new crimes may be just the tip of the iceberg: that he faces a conspiracy of death reaching back decades."
