<h2>As a nation, over the past ten weeks, we’ve become very attached to this year’s <cite>Great British Bake Off</cite> contestants. We won’t forget Paul Hollywood eating Val’s (gingerbread) sister, Selasi’s extremely chilled demeanour, or Mel reapplying Candice’s lipstick for her.</h2>

In fact, it could be argued that <cite>Bake Off</cite> contestants have particular staying power compared to stars of other TV competitions, as they often go on to produce quality recipe books that can be used again and again. One previous winner’s book has been issued from Suffolk Libraries an astounding 600 times! If you’ve caught the baking bug, try some of these <cite>Bake Off</cite> stars’ books.

Nadiya has certainly been busy since winning last year’s competition! <cite>Nadiya’s Kitchen</cite> categorises recipes according to time of day and occasion, such as ‘lazy Sunday mornings’, ‘midnight feasts’ and ‘snacks and sharing’. It features a huge range of recipes, from full English frittata to kofta kebab to meat samosas.

We’ve already raved about <cite>Nadiya’s Bake Me A Story</cite> on our <cite>Bake Off</cite>-inspired blog post about [baking books for children](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/bake-off-books/), but we just think it’s such an original idea to combine recipes with stories and the book is visually stunning. Make gingerbread men, very-berry muffins, bean patties and more.
