## [<cite>American Tabloid</cite>, by James Ellroy](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=243120)

> "1958. America is about to emerge into a bright new age – an age that will last until the 1000 days of John F Kennedy's presidency.

> "Three men move beneath the glossy surface of power, men allied to the makers and shakers of the era. Pete Bondurant – Howard Hughes's right-hand man, Jimmy Hoffa's hitman. Kemper Boyd – employed by J Edgar Hoover to infiltrate the Kennedy clan. Ward Littell – a man seeking redemption in Bobby Kennedy's drive against organised crime.

> "The festering discount of the age that burns brightly in these men's hearts will go into supernova as the Bay of Pigs ends in calamity, the Mob clamours for payback and the 1000 days ends in brutal quietus in 1963."

> "Sarat Chestnut, born in Louisiana, is only six when the Second American Civil War breaks out in 2074. But even she knows that oil is outlawed, that Louisiana is half underwater, that unmanned drones fill the sky. And when her father is killed and her family is forced into Camp Patience for displaced persons, she quickly begins to be shaped by her particular time and place until, finally, through the influence of a mysterious functionary, she is turned into a deadly instrument of war."

> "As British rule in India draws to a close, the threat of Partition gathers and sectarian violence escalates, spreading across the nation and inching ever closer to the affluent fringes of Lahore.

> "Lahore is where 8-year-old Lenny lives. Crippled by polio but inquisitive and spirited, Lenny spends her days in the park with her beautiful Ayah, enjoying the company of the plethora of suitors drawn to her striking nanny. There's the Sikh zoo-keeper, the Masseur, the Pathan, strong Imman Din, and Ice Candy Man, peddling popsicles along with political unrest through the streets.

> "But Lenny's world is upended as riots break out and the once harmonious people of Lahore turn against one another. Amid the chaos, her beloved Ayah is abducted. Lenny's innocence, exuberant humour, and heart-wrenching perspicacity leads us through these momentous events."
