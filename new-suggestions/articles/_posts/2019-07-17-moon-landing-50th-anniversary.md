This is an amazing book filled with interesting facts. For example:

* Every person who was ever born has seen the same moon as all who look at it today
* The idea of the countdown to launch came from the ex-Nazi employees working for NASA who had seen it in a Fritz Lang film
* The astronauts' suits were put together by women who were more used to sewing Playtex bras.

Fascinating stuff.

> "As pressure begins to mount around the impending mission and recurrent failings of the spacecraft leave the project hanging in the balance, Neil must question whether the need to fulfil mankind's biggest adventure outweighs the risk of possibly leaving his family behind forever and never returning home.
