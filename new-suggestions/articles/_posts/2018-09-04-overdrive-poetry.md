## [<cite>Inside the Wave</cite>, by Helen Dunmore](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3295068)

> "To be alive is to be inside the wave, always travelling until it breaks and is gone. These poems are concerned with the borderline between the living and the dead – the underworld and the human living world – and the exquisitely intense being of both. They possess a spare, eloquent lyricism as they explore the bliss and anguish of the voyage."

Tenth and final book of poetry from the late writer and winner of the 2017 Costa Poetry Award.
