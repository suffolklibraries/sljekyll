## [<cite>Christmas Days: 12 stories and 12 feasts for 12 days</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson, read by Jeanette Winterson & Imogen Church](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_455076&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "For years Jeanette Winterson has loved writing a new story at Christmastime, and here she brings together 12 of her brilliantly imaginative, funny and bold tales. For the 12 Days of Christmas – a time of celebration, sharing and giving – she offers these 12 plus one: a personal story of her own Christmas memories.

> "These tales give the listener a portal into the spirit of the season, where time slows down and magic starts to happen. From trees with mysterious powers to a tinsel baby that talks, philosophical fairies to flying dogs, a haunted house and a disappearing train, Winterson's innovative stories encompass the childlike and spooky wonder of Christmas."

> "Assuming the guise of an embittered and dissolute ex-agent, Leamas is set up to trap Mundt, the deputy director of the East German Intelligence Service – with himself as the bait. In the background is George Smiley, ready to make the game play out just as Control wants."

> "They all look pretty impossible for a motherless boy in Northern Sweden. Especially as his sailor dad is keen to drown his sadness in drink, and all the local matrons are narrowly watching the pair of them.

> "And then he saves old Simon from a frozen death in the woods, and Joel becomes a local hero."
