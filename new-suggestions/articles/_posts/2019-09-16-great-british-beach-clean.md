## [<cite>Rocky Shores</cite>, by John Archer-Thomson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2503331)

> "<cite>Rocky Shores</cite> explores the species, communities and landscape of the narrow strip of land surrounding much of the British Isles. While it maybe limited in extent, this habitat is incredibly biodiverse, and this insightful book details the patterns of marine life that might be encountered on both sheltered and exposed shores, from the inhospitable splash zone to the repeatedly submerged lower shore, and everything in-between."

## [<cite>Seashores: an ecological guide</cite>, by Julian Cremona](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1688989)

> "This guide provides a reference to commonly occurring organisms. With over 400 colour photographs, it looks first at the physical and biological features that determine our coast before surveying the variety of communities that exist on our shores."

## [<cite>Seashore Life of Britain and Europe</cite>, by Bob Gibbons, Denys Ovenden, Melanie Perkins & Helen Senior](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2022210)

> "This guide selects 150 species, including seaweeds, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, likely to be found and identified on the shorelines of Britain and Europe. Each species is described with detailed notes and illustrated in colour."

## [<cite>Beach Huts and Bathing Machines</cite>, by Kathryn Ferry](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=48940)

> "Behind the enduring popularity of beach huts lies a story of classic British eccentricity. Immensely photogenic & appealing, these colourful seaside buildings are direct successors of the Georgian bathing machine, which first appeared in the 1730s as a peculiar device to protect the modesty of rich & fashionable bathers."

## [<cite>The Pebbles on the Beach</cite>, by Clarence Ellis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2406716)

> "Pebble hunting is a pleasant and health-giving hobby, whether pursued on a beach, the lake-side, or the river-bank, and all but those who are nearing the last stages of decrepitude can enjoy it. This is a spirited guide to the simple pleasure of pebble spotting. Ellis is a charming, knowledgeable and witty guide to everything you didn't know you wanted to know about pebbles. He ruminates on what a pebble actually is, before showing us how they are formed, advising on the best pebble-spotting grounds in the UK, helping to identify individual stones and giving tips on the necessary kit."

## [<cite>The Secrets of Sand: a journey into the amazing microscopic world of sand</cite>, by Gary Greenberg, Carol Kiely & Kate Clover](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1882733)

> "In this volume, deep-focus microscope photography, x-ray images and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy reveal the geological secrets of sand - from everyday beach sand to sand from the Moon."

## [<cite>RSPB Handbook of the Seashore</cite>, by Maya Plass](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2415015)

> "How often have you visited the seashore and wished you knew more about the diverse and alien wildlife found on the UK's coastline? Illustrated with many images of coastal species, this book helps you to easily identify and learn about the life cycles and anatomy of the species you discover, and features useful sections on the tidal cycle, how to read tide tables, where to look, conservation and climate change concerns, and who to call should you come across something unexpected on your next beach visit."

## [<cite>The Forager's Calendar: a seasonal guide to nature's wild harvests</cite>, by John Wright](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2516655)

> "Look out of your window, walk down a country path or go to the beach in Great Britain, and you are sure to see many wild species that you can take home and eat. From dandelions in spring to sloe berries in autumn, via wild garlic, samphire, chanterelles and even grasshoppers, our countryside is full of edible delights in any season.

> "John Wright is the country's foremost expert in foraging and brings decades of experience, including as forager at the River Cottage, to this seasonal guide. Month by month, he shows us what species can be found and where, how to identify them, and how to store, use and cook them. You'll learn the stories behind the Latin names, the best way to tap a Birch tree, and how to fry an ant, make rosehip syrup and cook a hop omelette. Fully illustrated throughout, with tips on kit, conservation advice and what to avoid, this is an indispensable guide for everyone interested in wild food."

## [<cite>The Essential Guide to Beachcoming and the Strandline</cite>, by Steve Trewhella & Julie Hatcher](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2265963)

> "From time immemorial people have been drawn to the beach to collect practical resources as well as mysterious objects that have fuelled myth and folklore - it is our inherent hunter-gatherer instinct. Whether you are a seasoned beachcomber, a casual visitor or an enthusiastic naturalist, this book will satisfy your curiosity about the treasures found cast up on the beach strandline, be it a pretty seashell, a spent eggcase, a seaweed frond or an exotic ocean voyager. Every find has a story to tell and we aim to answer the questions that arise from each beachcombing discovery - what is it and where has it come from?"

## [<cite>Salt On Your Tongue: women and the sea</cite>, by Charlotte Runcie](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2487375)

> "Charlotte Runcie has always felt pulled to the sea, lured by its soothing, calming qualities but also enlivened and inspired by its salty wildness. When she loses her beloved grandmother, and becomes pregnant with her first child, she feels its pull even more intensely.

> "In <cite>Salt On Your Tongue</cite>, Charlotte explores what the sea means to us, and particularly what it has meant to women through the ages. This book is a walk on the beach with Turner, with Shakespeare, with the Romantic Poets and shanty-singers. It's an ode to our oceans - to the sailors who brave their treacherous waters, to the women who lost their loved ones to the waves, to the creatures that dwell in their depths, to beach trawlers, swimmers, seabirds and mermaids."

## [<cite>On the Beach at Night Alone</cite>, by Walt Whitman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1703551)

Poems from the celebrated nineteenth-century wordsmith.
