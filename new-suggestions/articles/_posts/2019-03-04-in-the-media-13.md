**Stock librarian Brandon King looks at some items that have recently been in the media that you can borrow from Suffolk Libraries.**

## [<cite>Withdrawn Traces: searching for the truth about Richey Manic</cite>, by Leon Noakes & Sara Hawys Roberts](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2322034)

> "From despair, to where? On 1 February 1995, Richey Edwards, guitarist of the Manic Street Preachers, went missing at the age of 27. On the eve of a promotional trip to America, he vanished from his London hotel room, his car later discovered near the Severn Bridge, a notorious suicide spot. Over two decades later, Richey's disappearance remains one of the most moving, mysterious and unresolved episodes in recent pop culture history.

> "For those with a basic grasp of the facts, Richey's suicide seems obvious and undeniable. However, a closer investigation of his actions in the weeks and months before his disappearance just don't add up, and until now few have dared to ask the important questions. This title is written with the co-operation of the Edwards family, testimony from Richey's closest friends and unprecedented and exclusive access to Richey's personal archive."
