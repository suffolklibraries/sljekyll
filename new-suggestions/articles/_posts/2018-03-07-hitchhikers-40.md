## Other favourites from Douglas Adams

### [<cite>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1273347)

> "Dirk Gently, self-styled private investigator, sets out to prove the fundamental interconnectedness of all things by solving a mysterious murder, assisting a mysterious professor, unravelling a mysterious mystery, and eating a lot of pizza - not to mention saving the entire human race from extinction along the way (at no extra charge)."

Adams himself described this as a "thumping good detective-ghost-horror-whodunnit-time-travel-romantic-musical-comedy-epic". Whatâ€™s not to love?

You can also watch the [TV adaptation of <cite>Dirk Gently</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=951563), with the perfectly cast Stephen Mangan and Darren Boyd.

### [<cite>The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1273348)

> "When a check-in desk at Heathrow Airport shot up through the roof engulfed in a ball of orange flame, the usual people tried to claim responsibility - the IRA, the PLO and the Gas Board. No rational cause could be found for the explosion - it was simply designated an act of God. But, thinks Dirk Gently, which God? And why?"

### [<cite>The Salmon of Doubt: hitchhiking the galaxy one last time</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1273352)

> "This title brings together eleven chapters of an unfinished 'Dirk Gently' novel, a collection of short stories and non-fiction pieces retrieved from the hard drive of Douglas Adams' computer, as well as lectures and articles on subjects as diverse as religion and the letter Y."

### [<cite>Last Chance to See</cite>, with Mark Carwardine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=242813)

> "After years of reflecting on the absurdities of life on other planets, Douglas Adams teamed up with zoologist Mark Carwardine to find out what was happening to life on this one. Together they lead us on an unforgettable journey across the world in search of exotic, endangered creatures that they may never see again."
