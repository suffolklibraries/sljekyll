> "A killer is out to make sure someone gets his just desserts. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has been on countless crime scenes, but this is definitely a first. Her fleeing target has left behind a truck loaded with ice cream and a dead body - frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans.

> "As fate would have it, Stephanie's mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the ice cream factory to find out who's killing employees and sabotaging the business. It's going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It's also going to be hard to explain to Trenton's hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger."

Pottering around a small picturesque town on an early summer's day, she is at peace. But her world is about to be shattered.

> "Remember me? Two words spoken by a woman from the back of a car that say so much yet reveal so little. As the car drives away Andee is left reeling, overwhelmed by shock, confusion, self-doubt and mounting trepidation. Almost 30 years ago, 14-year-old Penny had disappeared from her family's life, never to be heard from again. It is the missing child case that has haunted Andee her whole life; and now Penny - Andee's sister - is back. The question is: why?"

> "Responding to a call at a mansion in an East Bay neighbourhood, Deputy Coroner Clay Edison comes upon the body of Dr Walter Rennert, a controversial Berkeley psychologist, sprawled at the foot of his stairs. There are no wounds and no signs of intrusion or struggle.

> "Clay knows the obvious diagnosis is natural death. But ten years ago, Rennert's partner was found dead and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Tatiana, Rennert's daughter, will not let the case lie. She knows her father has been murdered. It is not part of Clay's job description to investigate crimes, but he is enthralled by Tatiana, drawn in to her twisted, alternate world.

All it takes is one haunting lie that cannot be undone."

The adults of the town are at a loss to explain the disappearance, but for Antoine, it all begins with the violent death of his neighbour's dog.

On a walk that takes her over 10 miles around the city, she meets bartenders, bodega clerks, security guards, criminals, children, parents and parents-to-be, while reviewing a life of excitement and adversity, passion and heartbreak, illuminating all the ways New York has changed – and has not."

While seeking justice for his frenemy and healing for a long fractured family, he comes face to face with an implacable enemy who has spent decades hiding in plain sight."
