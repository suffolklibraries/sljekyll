The [Suffolk Walking Festival](http://www.suffolkwalkingfestival.co.uk/) runs from 13 May 14 June. The festival consists of a selection of organised walks of varying lengths and for different needs and abilities all over Suffolk. We've picked some of the latest titles from our free digital magazine service, [Zinio](/elibrary/zinio/) to tie in with the festival. Happy walking!

## [<cite>Country Walking</cite>](http://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=8117/)

An obvious first choice, the latest issue of <cite>Country Walking</cite> suggests things to snack on, look for and count on your walks, inspiring stories of walkers meeting their walking targets and 30 ways walking has improved since the magazine was launched in 1987.

If you're taking on the festival's most challenging walks, perhaps it's time for a new pair of walking boots from the comparison section. If you're new to walking and the festival gives you a taste for walks further afield, you can find out about routes all over the UK.

## [<cite>BBC Countryfile Magazine</cite>](http://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=584)

Find out what wildlife and plants you might see on your walk and about country concerns. This magazine also features ideas for walks you might take if the festival gives you the bug - including one along the River Stour!

## [<cite>Practical Photography Lite</cite>](http://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=8133)

Taking your camera out with you? Try out some of this month's 'ten clicks' photograph ideas, find out how to take stunning landscape shots by 'breaking the rules', pick up some Photoshop techniques for maximum impact and be inspired by other photographers' amazing work.

## [<cite>BBC Wildlife Magazine</cite>](http://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=3021)

Read about some of the animals you might see out on a walk and find out about issues affecting natural habitats.

## [<cite>Bird Watching</cite>](http://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=8167)

Hoping to do some twitching while you're out? <cite>Bird Watching</cite> can help you identify the birds you see on your walk. You can also find out how rare they are and the steps being taken to protect them. There's also a feature about writer Ronald Blythe's home in rural Suffolk and the birds that can be found there.
