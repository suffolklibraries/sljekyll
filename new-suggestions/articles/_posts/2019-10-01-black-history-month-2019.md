> "In his first book, Noah tells his coming of age story with his larger-than-life mother during the last gasps of apartheid-era South Africa and the turbulent years that followed.

Though her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) accepts her friendship immediately and the girls become inseparable, Lord Mansfield and Lady Mansfield (Emily Watson) are tormented by the question of Dido's social status.

> "As Dido points out, it leaves her in a somewhat lonely position to be deemed 'too good' to dine with the servants and 'not good enough' to entertain visitors, but when she meets dashing young lawyer John Davinier (Sam Reid) she discovers an Englishman who accepts her as she is and offers his hand in marriage. Can the couple's love overcome the conventions and prejudices of the time?"
