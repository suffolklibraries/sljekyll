![Crack-Up, I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It](/images/featured/featured-latitude-2017.jpg)

This year's Latitude music festival takes place in Southwold on 14-16 July. We've put together a list of the latest albums from some of this year's performers.

## Headliners

### [Mumford and Sons - <cite>Wilder Mind</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1780754)

The festival favourites' last album, from 2015.

### [Fleet Foxes - <cite>Crack-Up</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169853)

This long-awaited and highly anticipated third album came out very recently and features lots of breathtaking harmonies.

### [The 1975 - <cite>I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1937927)

A catchy title for an album of fantastic pop songs full of interesting, smart lyrics.

## The best of the rest

### [Glass Animals - <cite>How To Be A Human Being</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2032213)

One of my favourite discoveries of 2017, Glass Animals excel at big anthems and carefully crafted tunes.

### [Goldfrapp - <cite>Silver Eye</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2148161)

With this latest album, Goldfrapp return to synthesisers resonant of 2003 release <cite>Black Cherry</cite>. I expect their Latitude will be nothing less than visually stunning.

### [Imelda May - <cite>Life Love Flesh Blood</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2125069)

May's signature rockabilly look has gone, but she still has an amazing voice, and this album explores some darker places than her earlier work.

### [Charlie Fink - <cite>Cover My Tracks</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2188129)

Latest album from the former lead singer of Jonah and the Whale.

### [Beth Orton - <cite>Kidsticks</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1986556)

Beth is known for her 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica.

### [Karen Elson - <cite>Double Roses</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2147080)

Former model Karen Elson is a terrific singer.

### [Katherine Jenkins - <cite>Celebration</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1990540)

The most recent release in a string of hit albums from the Welsh singer.

### [Julia Jacklin - <cite>Don't Let the Kids Win</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2056972)

Julia's sound is somewhere between folk and indie. This album, her first, was released to critical acclaim last year.

### [Leon Bridges - <cite>Coming Home</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1815561)

Leon Bridges has an amazing soul voice that at its best puts you in mind of the legendary Sam Cooke. This latest album, from 2015, is a great showcase of his style.

<cite>Coming Home</cite> is also available to stream or download for free (max. five tracks per borrower per week) on our [Freegal eMusic service](https://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/30808885/c29ueQ==).

### [Lisa Hannigan - <cite>At Swim</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2018146)

I first heard Lisa when she was one of the best things about former Latitude headliner Damien Rice's album <cite>O</cite>. Now a highly respected performer in her own right, her third album is hugely accomplished. It is likely you will hear a pin drop as she sings.

### [Loyle Carner - <cite>Yesterday's Gone</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2120030)

Debut album from the English hip-hop musician whose sound has been described by <cite>NME</cite> as 'sensitive and eloquent' and <cite>The Guardian</cite> as 'confessional hip-hop'.

### [Lucy Rose - <cite>Something's Changing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2178591)

The British singer/songwriter Lucy Rose recently took her guitar and backpacked across South and Central America, writing songs as she travelled and stayed with fans performing free shows as she went. This album is the result.

### [Placebo - <cite>A Place For Us To Dream</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2060916)

Hard to believe that Placebo have been going since 1996. This retrospective covers their best work over the last 20 years.

### [Public Service Broadcasting - <cite>Every Valley</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186283)

Inspired by the traditions surrounding British coal mining, <cite>Every Valley</cite> concentrates on abandoned and neglected communities across the western world, and the politics that have arisen as a result.

### [Sunflower Bean - <cite>Human Ceremony</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1926551)

Take a pinch of Black Sabbath, some Velvets and The Cure and a dash of Bolan and you have Sunflower Bean. <cite>Human Ceremony</cite> made the <cite>NME</cite>'s 'best of' list for 2016.

### [The Coral - <cite>Distance Inbetween</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1934723)

This latest album, released in 2016, was well-received, and of course The Coral have a great back catalogue too.

### [Jesus and Mary Chain - <cite>Damage and Joy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2127446)

A huge part of my youth, it's great to see Jesus & Mary chain back making music this year. They will be touring soon.

### [The Divine Comedy - <cite>Foreverland</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2039557)

Latest album, released in 2016, from the funny, clever and literary band known for the <cite>Father Ted</cite> theme tune and <cite>My Lovely Horse</cite>.

### [Ward Thomas - <cite>Cartwheels</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2034562)

Second album from the twin country stars.
