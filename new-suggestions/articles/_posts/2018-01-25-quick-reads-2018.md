With one in six adults still struggling to read, Quick Reads continues its work to break down the barriers to reading. Since its launch, Quick Reads has distributed over 4.5m books and there have been over 3.5m library loans.

Each year, Quick Reads publishes six short, plot-filled books written by well-known authors. They are designed to help people who have lost the reading habit or struggle with aspects of reading. Whether you're looking for an entertaining gateway to reading or already like these authors and want to read more from them, we encourage you to borrow them.

> "It's the moment we all fear: losing our phone, leaving us cut off from family and friends.

> "But, for Louise, losing hers in a local cafeÃÅ takes her somewhere much darker. After many hours of panic, Louise is relieved when someone gets in touch offering to return the phone. From then on she is impatient to get back to normal life. But when they meet on the beach, Louise realises you should be careful what you wish for."

> "As the sun sits high in the sky over Cornwall, and the sea breeze brings a welcome relief to the residents of the seaside village of Trevay, a stranger arrives in need of a safe haven.

> "The fact that the stranger is a Hollywood heartthrob makes villagers Penny and Dorrie even more keen to help. They both know what it's like to feel that you need a break from life, and they bring the village together to keep their stranger's secret. It's not long before he's helping some of the villagers find the answers to their own problems. In return, they find a place for him in their hearts."

## [<cite>Clean Break</cite>, by Tammy Cohen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315428)

> "Marriage is complicated, especially for Kate. Her husband Jack has a temper, and has been an absent father for years. Kate knows it's time for a divorce, but Jack refuses. Can Kate rid herself of her jealous husband before it's too late?"

> "The Premier No.1 Garage is the place to go in Mumbai if you want a luxury car. Even Mumbai's biggest gangster shops there - he's just ordered a classic race car worth millions.

> "But now the car is gone. Stolen from a locked room, in the middle of the night. Who stole it? The mechanic who is addicted to gambling? The angry ex-worker? The car thief pulling off one last job? And how on earth did they make it vanish from the locked garage?

> "Inspector Chopra has just days to find the culprit - and the missing car - before its owner finds out and takes violent revenge."

## [<cite>The Beach Wedding</cite>, by Dorothy Koomson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2315430)

> "Will your past always catch up with you?

> "Tessa Dannall is excited and happy when her daughter, Nia, arrives at their family's tropical beach resort to get married. Tessa is also trying to forget the last time she went to a wedding on this beach and how that day changed her life forever.

> "But as the big day draws near, Tessa realises she must face the deadly ghosts from her past - or they may ruin her daughter's future."

> "It's an exciting day for Timothy Flowers. It's the third of November, and it's Friday, and it's his 21st birthday.

> "When Timothy walks to his usual street corner to see his favourite special bus, he meets Charlie. Charlie is a builder who is desperate for Timothy's help because Timothy is very tall, six feet six inches. Timothy has never had a job before - or no work that he's kept for more than a day.

> "But when Timothy and Charlie have to collect money from a local thug, things don't exactly go according to plan. Over the course of one day, Timothy's life will change forever."
