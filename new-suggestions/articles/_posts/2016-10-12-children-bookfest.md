## Francesca Armour-Chelu

This year's Bookfest promises great activities for kids, whether they incline towards creating their own worlds with words or pictures.  

On the morning of Friday 28 October, local author Francesca Armour-Chelu is at Woodbridge Library to help 8-12 year-olds 'cook up a story'.  She will be leading fun and stimulating activities designed to help children create believable characters and settings, as well as boost their confidence in creative writing.  

Armour-Chelu's first book, <cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite> was published by leading children's publisher Walker Books earlier this year.  The eponymous hero lives in a world that has been ravaged by flooding, and is forced to flee the safety of his home as he learns the secrets of his past.  Pursued by the ruthless Terra Firma and their cold-blooded leader, Chilstone, he joins other child survivors in hiding and finds himself in peril as Chilstone's dreaded Fearzero Ship appears on the horizon and the water levels continue to rise.  

Having produced such an imaginative debut, there is little doubt that Armour-Chelu will have excellent advice for young writers who want to spin their own otherworldly yarns.

## Emily Hughes

If your child is a bit younger (aged 5-8) and artistically-inclined, they will enjoy author and illustrator Emily Hughes' art workshop at Woodbridge Library on Saturday 29 October.  Hawaii-born Hughes has written and illustrated two books, <cite>Wild</cite>, and <cite>The Little Gardener</cite>, both of which are visually stunning and impart powerful and inspiring messages.  

At this workshop, Emily will teach children how to draw the main character and woodland creatures from <cite>Wild</cite>, the tale of a 'completely wild' little girl, raised by creatures in the forest, who is discovered and taken to the city.  

This is sure to be a really fun session, as Emily is an exciting and energetic presenter who will encourage children's creativity and boost their confidence.  She will be available to sign copies of her books after the session.  Remember to bring along some old clothing or an apron as paints and crayons will be used!
