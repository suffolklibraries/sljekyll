![Sutton Hoo: burial ground of kings?, The Dig, Sutton Hoo: the Anglo-Saxon way of life and death](/images/featured/featured-sutton-hoo-books.jpg)

Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, is the site of two sixth- and early-seventh-century cemeteries which were discovered in 1939. One cemetery contained an undisturbed ship burial, including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding archaeological significance, most of which can now be seen in the British Museum.

It is generally thought that Raedwald, the ruler of the East Angles, was buried in the ship. Raedwald is still remembered locally in some of our street names.

The archaeological site is in the care of the [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/). Staff from Sutton Hoo are visiting several Suffolk libraries with their fascinating information and artefacts over the next few months. If you want to know more, why not have a look at some of the many books about this outstanding archaeological site?

You can also find out more from the [Seckford Collection at Woodbridge Library](/special-collections/).
