Horrified to have a convicted murderess in their midst, the family avoid contact with Agnes – until one winter night, she begins her whispered confession to them, and they realise that all is not as they had assumed.

> "<cite>Life After Life</cite> follows Ursula Todd as she lives through the turbulent events of the last century again and again. With wit and compassion, Kate Atkinson finds warmth even in life's bleakest moments, and shows an extraordinary ability to evoke the past.

## [<cite>David & Goliath: underdogs, misfits, and the art of battling giants</cite>, written and read by Malcolm Gladwell](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_052104&filter=all&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172&browseItemId=338197)

> "Why do underdogs succeed so much more than we expect? How do the weak outsmart the strong? In <cite>David and Goliath</cite>, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on a scintillating and surprising journey through the hidden dynamics that shape the balance of power between the small and the mighty. From the conflicts in Northern Ireland and Vietnam, through the tactics of civil rights leaders and the problem of privilege, Gladwell demonstrates how we misunderstand the true meaning of advantage and disadvantage."

Winner of the Audie Award 2014 (Non-fiction).

Try wearing a veil on your head and practising the bum's-up position at lunchtime and you know you're in for a tough time at school.

> "Luckily my friends support me, although they've got a few troubles of their own. Simone, blonde, gorgeous and overweight - she's got serious image issues, and Leila's really intelligent but her parents are more interested in her getting a marriage certificate than her high school certificate! And I thought I had problems."
