Every day until Christmas Eve, stock team member and book expert Jo Dixon will recommend a great title for children or young adults. Today's book is <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=276519"><cite>Owl Babies</cite></a>, by Martin Waddell.

A favourite of pre-school children for generations, this is the story of three baby owls, Sarah, Percy and Bill, who wake one night to find their mother gone. And as the darkness gathers and they perch patiently on their branch waiting for her return, oh how they worry! What are those scary noises all around them? What is mum doing? When will she be back?
