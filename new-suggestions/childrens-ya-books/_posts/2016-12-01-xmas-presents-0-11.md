<h2>Board books</h2>

<h3>Sally Symes and Nick Sharratt - <cite>Yawn</cite></h3>

This rhyming board book, first published in 2012, is more or less guaranteed to help you (and your child?) nod off to sleep. Each page has a large die-cast hole, it’s very sturdy and it should last almost to next Christmas before you need to buy another copy. Warning: the yawn is infectious.

<h3><cite>My Best Ever Pop-up Build Book</cite></h3>

If you’re looking for a book for the toddler who loves watching diggers and cement mixers, this is the one for you. It is well produced, with large pop up photos of a wide range of vehicles and it has a sound button too. Good old DK!

<h2>Picture books</h2>

<h3>Steve Antony - <cite>The Queen's Present</cite></h3>

The Queen and her corgi swoop around the world with Father Christmas in search of presents for her great grandchildren in this gorgeous new Steve Antony picture book. The palette is a seasonal green with a touch of red, the cover shines, the sleigh soars over iconic landmarks and the endpapers are populated with elves. It is a beautiful object and funny too, just perfect for Christmas.

<h3>Helen &amp; Thomas Doherty - <cite>The Knight Who Wouldn't Fight</cite></h3>

Celebrate the power of reading with this gentle tale of a little knight who tames a dragon with a story.

<h3>T. S. Eliot and Arthur Robins - <cite>Macavity's Not There!</cite></h3>

Faber have been republishing <cite>Old Possum</cite> in picture book format for a couple of years now, but whoever thought of producing Macavity in a lift-the-flap format (like <cite>Spot</cite>) was inspired. It’s the most perfect book to share with very young children, and would make a super present.

<h3>Kes Gray - <cite>Oi Dog!</cite></h3>

One of our favourite picture books of 2016, this hilarious rhyme about a frog who is fed up with being sat on by dogs provides excellent phonics practice as well as amusement. Every home should have a copy. And of the brilliant prequel <cite>Oi Frog</cite>, about a frog who has had enough of sitting on logs!

<h3>Teresa Heapy &amp; Sue Heap - <cite>Very Little Sleeping Beauty</cite></h3>

Do you too have a Very Little Sleeping Beauty who isn’t tired enough to go to sleep? Share this book and laugh together before bed.

<h3>David Melling - <cite>D Is For Duck!</cite></h3>

This is the cleverest alphabet book we have seen for years. It tells the story of Duck, a magician who conjures up an A–Z of animals each of whom adds to the narrative. Making an alphabet book funny and interesting takes some doing, but then it was written by the talented creator of <cite>Hugless Douglas</cite>.

<h2>Short chapter books</h2>

<h3>Harriet Muncaster - <cite>Isadora Moon Goes To School</cite></h3>

This book about Isadora, who is half fairy and half vampire, would make a super gift for un-girly children who have just started to read by themselves. There are several other Isadora titles to collect.

<h3>Chae Strathie - <cite>Captain Firebeard's School For Pirates</cite></h3>

Walking the plank, climbing to the crow’s nest and other piratical skills, all wrapped up in a jolly adventure with alternating pages of text and illustrations. Catnip for some children we know.

<h2>Junior novels</h2>

<h3>Sarah Baker - <cite>Through The Mirror Door</cite></h3>

Set in a crumbling house in France, this is a compelling, atmospheric time-slip story about a recently orphaned girl who slips 100 years away from her horrible cousins, into a room where a boy lies ill. A really good read, it has a thrilling plot and a pleasing ending.

<h3>Peter Bunzl - <cite>Cogheart</cite></h3>

Set in an invented Victorian era where travelling by airships was commonplace and where servants were often automaton, <cite>Cogheart</cite> is set to become a classic. With courageous protagonists struggling against powerful villains and a plot full of twists and turns, it is gripping to the very end.

The sash on the cover describes this book as "a stunning adventure of danger and daring" and it really is a *tour de force* of a children’s novel, gathering plaudits from many other writers. It would make a brilliant family read for the Christmas holiday and a super present for any 8–12 year-old.

<h3>Pete Johnson - <cite>How To Update Your Parents</cite></h3>
