## Board books

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6685129?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1626240)&QRYTEXT=Never%20Touch%20a%20Monster">Rosie Greening &amp; Stuart Lynch - <cite>Never Touch a Monster</cite></a></h3>

This bright and cheerful tactile board book is bound to become a favourite. The very young will enjoy feeling the bumpy rubbery monster mouths on each page, whilst toddlers and pre-school children will soon join in chanting the cautionary rhymes.  Fingers crossed that the soft scrubbing brush mouth on the front cover withstands life in a public library!

## Picture books

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/OPAC/BIBENQ/6690716/65758600,3">Peter Bently &amp; Sernur Isik - <cite>Potion Commotion</cite></a></h3>

When little witch Betty tries her hand at cooking, into the cauldron goes everything from strawberry jam to slices of ham! Betty's potion keeps on growing and soon it's spreading all over town. But when a hungry dragon arrives, can Betty's brew save the day?

This charming picture book is a heart-warming sequel to <cite>Storm</cite> in which Noi rescued a little whale. Now as winter sets in, the little whale and his family return the kindness, nudging Noi’s boat across the open sea to safety in the lighthouse where his father is sheltering. Beautiful.

A family of owls try to avoid the family of bats who hang beneath their branch in this brilliant wordless picture book. Their struggle against the elements is heart-warming and those baby owls are just plain cute.

A cautionary tale about the dangers of internet safety, told and illustrated with wit and mastery. The tale is in rhyme, and the internet trolls are just two foolish goats.

## Junior novels

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6702045?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(65785403)&QRYTEXT=Rover%20and%20the%20big%20fat%20baby">Roddy Doyle - <cite>Rover and the Big Fat Baby</cite></a></h3>

It's the summer holidays and Rover is busy searching for poo. He works for The Gigglers, small furry creatures who make sure grown-ups are nice to their kids. If they aren't, they get the Giggler Treatment - a smelly, squishy present on the end of their shoe, which is where Rover comes in. But Rover and his nephew Messi (who is actually very tidy) are distracted from their job by a Big Fat Baby (B.F.B) who's fallen out of her Granny's backpack.

The Jessop family arrive on Storey Street, pitching their caravan in the waste ground known to generations of Storey Street children as "The House That Was Stolen".  Jemima Jessop, tightrope walker extraordinaire, defeats the bullying Milner family, who want to build on the patch of land, using the powers of kindness and understanding. It sounds pious, but it is a laugh-out-loud treat full of larks and japes made all the more enjoyable by Sara Ogilvie’s brilliant illustrations. This is the third book in the <cite>Storey Street</cite> series (think <cite>Demolition Dad</cite> and <cite>Superhero Street</cite>) and I hope Phil Earle is planning another ten at least.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/OPAC/BIBENQ/6708105/67560146,2">Neil Gaiman &amp; Chris Riddell - <cite>Odd and the Frost Giants</cite></a></h3>

This is a wonderful Viking tale written by Neil Gaiman, about a boy called Odd, who journeys across frozen lands after the death of his father. Chris Riddell’s illustrations are extraordinary and the book itself is so beautifully engineered that you’ll want to own a copy.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6711076?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(69495617)&QRYTEXT=Sherlock%20Holmes%20and%20the%20disappearing%20diamond">Sam Hearn - <cite>Sherlock Holmes and the Disappearing Diamond</cite></a></h3>

John Watson has barely settled into his new school, Baker Street Academy, when his teacher announces a trip to one of London's top museums, home to the world's most famous jewel. But it's been stolen! When police catch the thief it seems the case is closed. Can Sherlock Holmes uncover the mystery behind this extraordinary gem?

"Here's my excellent plan to make DogZombies the best band in the whole wide world! How hard can it be? I'm going to: 1. Write more songs (not about teachers). 2. Make a spectacular music video (easy). 3. Get some sleep (tricky when you're being kept awake by loud noises). 4. Annoy Delia (nothing to do with DogZombies but always fun)."

The 11th book in the <cite>Tom Gates</cite> series looks as funny as the first ten. LOL.
