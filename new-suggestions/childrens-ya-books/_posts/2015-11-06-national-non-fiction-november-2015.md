      This must be the most sumptuous DK book ever. It’s like all their other books rolled into one. It’s full of stunning colour photos to pore over and would last you for the whole of the Christmas holidays and beyond. I would suggest it as a desert island book, but there is it weighs an absolute ton. Great for Christmas present list!

      Packed full of information about how things work, the author explains with great clarity exactly what happens when you flick a switch, flush the loo and so on. Rob Beattie’s Heath Robinson meets Steampunk illustrations are just brilliant.

      Lighting, wigs, make-up, stage sets, the role of the director, seating patterns. It’s all here. Benedict Cumberbatch describes this as a brilliant introduction, and he knows what he talking about! Brilliant!
