  </div>


We love the new Flip Flap series where you turn the top and bottom of each page independently to create the most unusual animals. I think my favourite animal in this book is the Hirrel (horse/goat) or perhaps the Chow (chicken/cow).

## Best picture books for 2-4 year olds

### [<cite>The Queen&#8217;s Hat</cite> by Steve Antony](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6037980?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35038424)&QRYTEXT=The%20Queen%27s%20hat)

  </div>
Capturing the essence of London and Englishness, a troop of guardsmen follow the Queen on a windy day as she chases around London’s famous landmarks in pursuit of her hat. If you look closely you might notice her butler running through the book carrying a tray set for afternoon tea.

  </div>

Nicola O’Byrne was nominated for the Greenaway prize for her stunning illustrations. I think she should win it for the cover alone – those teeth! (well I suppose it is subtitled “a book with bite”!)

### [<cite>Ten Little Princesses</cite> by Mike Brownlow & Simon Rickerty](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6076930?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39261108)&QRYTEXT=Ten%20little%20princesses)

Elmore was an only child until a new baby arrived to usurp him. Lauren Child’s book is just about perfect and already becoming a classic &#8216;situation&#8217; book for parents and playgroups.

### [<cite>Bears Don&#8217;t Read!</cite> by Emma Chichester Clark](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6087429?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39946122)&QRYTEXT=Bears%20don%27t%20read!)

Brave little Clementine, teaches a misunderstood bear, George, which changes his life for ever. If you want a book to promote the joy of reading, then <cite>Bears Don’t Read</cite> should be just the job.

  </div>

Shortlisted for the Red House Book Award 2015, this is the hilarious story of the babysitter who loses her cool, and the children who eventually fell asleep. I haven’t threatened that particular dire warning yet, but it’s such a good line, it’s only a matter of time.

### [<cite>Gigantosaurus</cite> by Jonny Duddle](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6095519?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1371894)&QRYTEXT=Gigantosaurus)

  </div>

In this prehistoric version of <cite>The boy who cried wolf</cite>, self-appointed look-out Bonehead cries “Gigantosaurus!” once too often. Come on, altogether now &#8211; “His feet go stomp and his jaws go crunch, and in the blink of an eye you’ll be his &#8230;”

### [<cite>Very Little Red Riding Hood</cite> by Teresa Heapy & Sue Heap](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6099198?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25771433)&QRYTEXT=Very%20Little%20Red%20Riding%20Hood)

The wolf is no match for the very bossy toddler in this retake on a classic tale. Both text and illustrations are full of humour and it reads aloud as smoothly as a knife through butter. A sheer delight from start to finish &#8211; my absolute top favourite picture book of 2014.

## Best books for young readers

### [<cite>Betsy Biggelow is here</cite> by Malorie Blackman](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8099739?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36215225)&QRYTEXT=Betsey%20Biggalow%20is%20here!)

  </div>

This is the story of Boyface Antelope who longs to turn 10 so he can become a stripe-monger like his dad. And as if that weren’t crazy enough, in his second story we meet a tartan badger and after Christmas we’ll be introduced to the “uncertain ponies”. We’ve got loads of copies on order for January.

### [<cite>The Jolley Rogers and the ghostly galleon</cite> by Jonny Duddle](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8194453?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35744002)&QRYTEXT=The%20Jolley-Rogers%20and%20the%20ghostly%20galleon)

Amusing story about Matilda and Jim Lad, the crew from <cite>The Pirates Next Door</cite>. It’s just the right length for children who have progressed to chapter books at bedtime. Rumour has it that it’s the start of a series. Good!

  </div>

Ladybird books have refreshed their Read it yourself series, and this title from Level 1, is based on the Peter Rabbit TV series. It has great cover appeal, the illustrations are photographic quality and the type face is large and bold. Perfect for a child just learning to read by themselves.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>The Parent Agency</cite> by David Baddiel](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9215225?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41339396)&QRYTEXT=The%20parent%20agency)

Just imagine being able to choose your own parents – Barry did and it wasn’t as much fun as he’d hoped. An original and very funny book from a well known comedian.

Second title in the series about Compton Valance. It’s gross. Should go down well then. (The book, not the sandwich!)

  </div>

It’s difficult to choose just one favourite from this new comic books series. <cite>The Diary of Dennis the Menace</cite> is set to run and run, bringing tasteful humour to a new generation of nostalgic dads. As the back cover says, “All aboard the vomit comet!”

### [<cite>The Tin Snail</cite> by Cameron McAllister](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9249390?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36215181)&QRYTEXT=The%20tin%20snail)

  </div>

Family story woven around the history of the 2CV. Set in WWII France, the plot moves from Paris to a small village and back again. Potential to become a wonderful film.

Literary parody, full of cultural allusions and eccentricities. If you haven’t come across Goth Girl before, you might be better starting with the first title in the series, <cite>Goth Girl and the Ghost of a Mouse</cite>. Both are a pleasure to look at and a hoot to read.

### [<cite>Rooftoppers</cite> by Katherine Rundell](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9252110?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17853516)&QRYTEXT=Rooftoppers)
