### [<cite>The Confessions of Frannie Langton</cite>, by Sara Collins, read by the author and Roy McMillan](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_706282&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "<em>They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don't believe I've done?</em>

> "1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning - slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth. But they are not the whole truth.

> "For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed.

> "But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?"

### [<cite>Ikigai</cite>, by Héctor García & Francesc Miralles, read by Naoko Mori](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_565842&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "The people of Japan believe that everyone has an ikigai – a reason for being; the thing that gets you out of bed each morning. And according to the residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa – the world’s longest-living people – finding it is the key to a longer and more fulfilled life.

> "Inspiring and comforting, this book will bring you closer to these centenarians’ secrets: how they leave urgency behind; keep doing what they love for as long as possible; nurture friendships; live in the moment; participate in their communities and throw themselves into their passions. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own personal ikigai.

> "Because who doesn’t want to find happiness in every day?"

### [<cite>Mudlarking</cite>, written and read by Lara Maiklem](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_697724&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "<em>Mudlark (/'mAdla;k/) noun A person who scavenges for usable debris in the mud of a river or harbour.</em>

> "Lara Maiklem has scoured the banks of the Thames for over fifteen years, in pursuit of the objects that the river unearths: from Neolithic flints to Roman hair pins, medieval buckles to Tudor buttons, Georgian clay pipes to Victorian toys. These objects tell her about London and its lost ways of life.

> "Moving from the river's tidal origins in the west of the city to the point where it meets the sea in the east, <cite>Mudlarking</cite> is a search for urban solitude and history on the River Thames, which Lara calls the longest archaeological site in England.

> "As she has discovered, it is often the tiniest objects that tell the greatest stories."

### [<cite>The Museum of Broken Promises</cite>, by Elizabeth Buchan, read by Joan Walker](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_697768&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Paris, today. The Museum of Broken Promises is a place of wonder and sadness, hope and loss. Every object in the museum has been donated – a cake tin, a wedding veil, a baby's shoe. And each represent a moment of grief or terrible betrayal. The museum is a place where people come to speak to the ghosts of the past and, sometimes, to lay them to rest. Laure, the owner and curator, has also hidden artefacts from her own painful youth amongst the objects on display.

> "Prague, 1985. Recovering from the sudden death of her father, Laure flees to Prague. But life behind the Iron Curtain is a complex thing: drab and grey yet charged with danger. Laure cannot begin to comprehend the dark, political currents that run beneath the surface of this communist city. Until, that is, she meets a young dissident musician. Her love for him will have terrible and unforeseen consequences.

> "It is only years later, having created the museum, that Laure can finally face up to her past and celebrate the passionate love which has directed her life."

### [<cite>The Sentence is Death</cite>, by Anthony Horowitz, read by Rory Kinnear](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_676594&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "<em>You shouldn’t be here. It’s too late...</em>

> "These, heard over the phone, were the last recorded words of successful celebrity-divorce lawyer Richard Pryce, found bludgeoned to death in his bachelor pad with a bottle of wine – a 1982 Chateau Lafite worth £3000, to be precise.

> "Odd, considering he didn’t drink. Why this bottle? And why those words? And why was a three-digit number painted on the wall by the killer? And, most importantly, which of the man’s many, many enemies did the deed?

> "Baffled, the police are forced to bring in Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne and his sidekick, the author Anthony, who’s really getting rather good at this murder investigation business.

> "But as Hawthorne takes on the case with characteristic relish, it becomes clear that he, too, has secrets to hide. As our reluctant narrator becomes ever more embroiled in the case, he realises that these secrets must be exposed – even at the risk of death..."

### [<cite>Shinrin-Yoku: the art and science of forest bathing</cite>, by Dr Qing Li, read by Ramon Tikaram](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_576732&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Shinrin-Yoku or forest bathing is the practice of spending time in the forest for better health, happiness and a sense of calm. A pillar of Japanese culture for decades, Shinrin-Yoku is a way to reconnect with nature, from walking mindfully in the woods, to a break in your local park, to walking barefoot on your lawn.

> "Forest Medicine expert Dr Qing Li's research has proven that spending time around trees (even filling your home with house plants and vaporising essential tree oils) can reduce blood pressure, lower stress, boost energy, boost immune system and even help you to lose weight."

### [<cite>The Volunteer: the true story of the resistance hero who infiltrated Auschwitz</cite>, by Jack Fairweather, read by David Rintoul](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_690941&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "This is untold story of one of the greatest heroes of the Second World War.

> "In the Summer of 1940, after the Nazi occupation of Poland, an underground operative called Witold Pilecki accepted a mission to uncover the fate of thousands of people being interred at a new concentration camp on the border of the Reich. His mission was to report on Nazi crimes and raise a secret army to stage an uprising. The name of the detention centre - Auschwitz. It was only after arriving at the camp that he started to discover the Nazis' terrifying designs.

> "Over the next two and half years, Witold forged an underground army that smuggled evidence of Nazi atrocities to the West, culminating in the mass murder of over a million Jews."

### [<cite>You'll Never See Me Again</cite>, by Lesley Pearce, read by Lucy Brownhill](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_699521&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Young Betty dreams of settling down to an ordinary life in Hallsands with her fisherman husband. But when he returns broken and haunted from the Great War, she finds herself persecuted by his distraught mother – and yearns to escape.

> "It is only when a storm devastates the village that Betty sees her chance. Fleeing to Bristol and changing her name to Mabel Brook, she seeks a new life – only to discover destiny has other plans.

> "Penniless and alone, Mabel suffers a brutal attack before being rescued by a psychic named Nora Nightingale. She gets her first taste of those who receive messages from the dead and realises she may have this power herself. But Mabel fears her gift may be a terrible curse as it becomes ever harder to hide from the truth about who she once was – and the tragic life she left behind.

> "Soon Mabel receives her own message and is forced back to the very place she has escaped. A place of heartbreak and perhaps even murder – but to secure her future Mabel must confront her past one last time."

### [<cite>Ghostland: in search of a haunted country</cite>, by Edward Parnell, read by Sam Woolf](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=HUA_687123&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "In his late thirties, Edward Parnell found himself trapped in the recurring nightmare of a family tragedy. For comfort, he turned to his bookshelves, back to the ghost stories that obsessed him as a boy, and to the writers through the ages who have attempted to confront what comes after death.

> "In <cite>Ghostland</cite>, Parnell goes in search of the ‘sequestered places’ of the British Isles, our lonely moors, our moss-covered cemeteries, our stark shores and our folkloric woodlands. He explores how these landscapes conjured and shaped a kaleidoscopic spectrum of literature and cinema, from the ghost stories and weird fiction of M. R. James, Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood to the children’s fantasy novels of Alan Garner and Susan Cooper; from W. G. Sebald’s <cite>The Rings of Saturn</cite> and Graham Swift’s <cite>Waterland</cite> to the archetypal ‘folk horror’ film <cite>The Wicker Man</cite>...

> "<cite>Ghostland</cite> is Parnell’s moving exploration of what has haunted our writers and artists – and what is haunting him."
