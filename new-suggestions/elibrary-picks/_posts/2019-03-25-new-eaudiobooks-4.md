## [<cite>Becoming</cite>, written and read by Michelle Obama](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_591751&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerising storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms.

> "Warm, wise, and revelatory, <cite>Becoming</cite> is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations - and whose story inspires us to do the same."

> "When three female schoolteachers go missing in San Francisco, Detective Lindsay Boxer must unravel the mystery of their disappearance. But what starts as a missing person case quickly escalates to a troubling murder investigation.

> "As pressure at work mounts, Lindsay must rely on her husband Joe to support her at home. Yet Joe is pursuing a mysterious case himself, as a woman running from her past brings him terrifying information – the notorious war criminal from her Eastern European home country has appeared on the streets of San Francisco.

> "As Lindsay searches for the three missing women, a frightening new twist forces her and Joe's investigations to collide. His mystery informant has gone missing, and all four abducted women are in grave danger. As shocking revelations emerge, Lindsay and Joe find themselves caught up in an international crime operation unlike anything they've seen before.

> "With the help of her fierce and courageous friends in the Women's Murder Club, Lindsay and Joe fight to save their city from the corrupt clutches of a monster."

## [<cite>Come a Little Closer</cite>, by Rachel Abbott, read by Lisa Coleman](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_597146&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Snow is falling softly as a young woman takes her last breath.

> "Fifteen miles away, two women sit silently in a dark kitchen. They don't speak, because there is nothing left to be said.

> "Another woman boards a plane to escape the man who is trying to steal her life. But she will have to return, sooner or later.

> "These strangers have one thing in common. They each made one bad choice – and now they have no choices left. Soon they won't be strangers, they'll be family..."

> "When DCI Tom Douglas is called to the cold, lonely scene of a suspicious death, he is baffled. Who is she? Where did she come from? How did she get there? How many more must die? Who is controlling them, and how can they be stopped?"

## [<cite>The Flower Girls</cite>, by Alice Clark-Platts, read by Emilia Fox](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_583507&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Three children went out to play. Only two came back.

> "The Flower Girls. Laurel and Primrose. One convicted of murder, the other given a new identity.

## [<cite>Gingerbread</cite>, written and read by Helen Oyeyemi](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_596598&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Perdita Lee may appear your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor flat with some surprisingly verbal vegetation.

> "And then there’s the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it’s very popular in Druhástrana, the far-away (and, according to Wikipedia, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee’s early youth. In fact, the world’s truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread is Harriet’s charismatic childhood friend, Gretel Kercheval – a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.

> "Years later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother’s long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet’s story, as well as a reunion or two. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value."

## [<cite>Love You Dead</cite>, by Peter James, read by Daniel Weyman](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=MDA_501211&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "An ugly duckling as a child, Jodie Bentley had two dreams in life - to be beautiful and rich. She's achieved the first, with a little help from a plastic surgeon, and now she's working hard on the second. Her philosophy on money is simple: you can either earn it or marry it. Marrying is easy, it's getting rid of the husband afterwards that's harder, that takes real skill. But hey, practice makes perfect...

> "Detective Superintendent Roy Grace is feeling the pressure from his superiors, his previous case is still giving him sleepless nights, there have been major developments with his missing wife Sandy, and an old adversary is back. But worse than all of this, he now believes a Black Widow is operating in his city. One with a venomous mind... and venomous skills. Soon Grace comes to the frightening realisation that he may have underestimated just how dangerous this lady is."
