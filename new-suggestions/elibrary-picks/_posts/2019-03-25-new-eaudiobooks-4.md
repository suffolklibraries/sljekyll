> "In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerising storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms.

Yet Joe is pursuing a mysterious case himself, as a woman running from her past brings him terrifying information – the notorious war criminal from her Eastern European home country has appeared on the streets of San Francisco.

> "As Lindsay searches for the three missing women, a frightening new twist forces her and Joe's investigations to collide. His mystery informant has gone missing, and all four abducted women are in grave danger. As shocking revelations emerge, Lindsay and Joe find themselves caught up in an international crime operation unlike anything they've seen before.

> "Another woman boards a plane to escape the man who is trying to steal her life. But she will have to return, sooner or later.

> "When DCI Tom Douglas is called to the cold, lonely scene of a suspicious death, he is baffled. Who is she? Where did she come from? How did she get there? How many more must die? Who is controlling them, and how can they be stopped?"

### [<cite>Daughters of Courage</cite>, by Margaret Dickinson, read by Julie Teal](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=MDA_500835&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Perdita Lee may appear your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor flat with some surprisingly verbal vegetation.

> "And then there’s the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it’s very popular in Druhástrana, the far-away (and, according to Wikipedia, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee’s early youth. In fact, the world’s truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread is Harriet’s charismatic childhood friend, Gretel Kercheval – a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.

> "Years later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother’s long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet’s story, as well as a reunion or two. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value."

### [<cite>Love You Dead</cite>, by Peter James, read by Daniel Weyman](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=MDA_501211&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "An ugly duckling as a child, Jodie Bentley had two dreams in life - to be beautiful and rich. She's achieved the first, with a little help from a plastic surgeon, and now she's working hard on the second. Her philosophy on money is simple: you can either earn it or marry it. Marrying is easy, it's getting rid of the husband afterwards that's harder, that takes real skill. But hey, practice makes perfect...

> "Detective Superintendent Roy Grace is feeling the pressure from his superiors, his previous case is still giving him sleepless nights, there have been major developments with his missing wife Sandy, and an old adversary is back. But worse than all of this, he now believes a Black Widow is operating in his city. One with a venomous mind... and venomous skills. Soon Grace comes to the frightening realisation that he may have underestimated just how dangerous this lady is."

### [<cite>Monsters</cite>, written and read by Lee Evans](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=RBE_501448&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

### [<cite>Safe With Me</cite>, by K. L. Slater, read by Lucy Price-Lewis](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_585359&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Thirteen years ago someone did something very bad to Anna. Now it’s her turn to get even.

> "Anna lives a solitary existence, taking solace in order and routine. Her only friend is the lonely old lady next door. She doesn’t like to let people to get too close – she knows how much damage they can do.

> "Then one ordinary day Anna witnesses a devastating road accident and recognises the driver as Carla, the woman who ruined her life all those years ago. Now it’s Anna’s chance to set things straight but her revenge needs to be executed carefully. First she needs to get to know Liam, the man injured in the accident. She needs to follow the police investigation. She needs to watch Carla from the shadows.

> "But as Anna’s obsession with Carla escalates, her own secrets start to unravel. Is Carla really dangerous or does Anna need to worry about someone far closer to home?"

### [<cite>The Suspect</cite>, by Fiona Barton, read by Mark Meadows, Sian Thomas, Ria Zmitrowicz & Clare Corbett](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_591786&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "When two 18-year-old girls go missing on their gap year in Thailand, their families are thrust into the international spotlight: desperate, bereft and frantic with worry.

> "Journalist Kate Waters always does everything she can to be first to the story, first with the exclusive, first to discover the truth – and this time is no exception. But she can’t help but think of her own son, who she hasn’t seen in two years, since he left home to go travelling. This time it’s personal.

> "And as the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think..."

### [<cite>Brit(ish)</cite>, written and read by Afua Hirsch](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_576704&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Afua Hirsch is British. Her parents are British. She was raised, educated and socialised in Britain. Her partner, daughter, sister and the vast majority of her friends are British. So why is her identity and sense of belonging a subject of debate? The reason is simply because of the colour of her skin.

> "Blending history, memoir and individual experiences, Afua Hirsch reveals the identity crisis at the heart of Britain today. Far from affecting only minority people, Britain is a nation in denial about its past and its present. We believe we are the nation of abolition, but forget we are the nation of slavery. We sit proudly at the apex of the Commonwealth, but we flinch from the legacy of the Empire. We are convinced that fairness is one of our values, but that immigration is one of our problems.

> "<cite>Brit(ish)</cite> is the story of how and why this came to be, and an urgent call for change."

### [<cite>Everyday Sexism</cite>, by Laura Bates, read by the author and Sarah Brown](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_571947&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "In 2012, after being sexually harassed on London public transport Laura Bates, a young journalist, started a project called Everyday Sexism to collect stories for a piece she was writing on the issue. Astounded by the response she received and the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, she quickly realised that the situation was far worse than she'd initially thought. Enough was enough. From being leered at and wolf-whistled on the street, to aggravation in the work place and serious sexual assault, it was clear that sexism had been normalised. Bates decided it was time for change.

> "This bold, jaunty, and ultimately intelligent book is the first to give a collective voice to the protest against sexism. This game-changing book is a juggernaut of stories, often shocking, sometimes amusing, and always poignant - it is a must-listen for every inquisitive, no-nonsense modern woman. Welcome to the fourth wave of feminism."

### [<cite>No Logo</cite>, by Naomi Klein, read by Nicola Barber](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_571260&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons.

> "In this provocative study we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic, status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labour, how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how culture jammers utilise spray paint, computer hacking acumen and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads."

### [<cite>One of Us is Lying</cite>, by Karen McManus, read by Robbie Daymond, Kim Mai Guest & MacLeod Andrews](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_576406&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention. Bronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing. Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher. And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.

> "These five strangers walk in, but only four come out alive. All of them have something to hide, but how far have they gone to protect it?"

### [<cite>Talking to My Daughter About the Economy: a brief history of capitalism</cite>, by Yanis Varoufakis, read by Leighton Pugh](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_565092&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Why is there so much inequality? In this short book, world famous economist Yanis Varoufakis sets out to answer his daughter Xenia’s deceptively simple question. Using personal stories and famous myths – from Oedipus and Faust to Frankenstein and The Matrix – he explains what the economy is and why it has the power to shape our lives."

> "Witchfinder Shadwell and his assistant Newton Pulsifier are also en route to Tadfield to investigate unusual phenomena in the area, while Anathema Device, descendent of prophetess Agnes Nutter, tries to decipher her ancestor’s cryptic predictions.

> "Atlantis is rising; fish are falling from the sky; everything seems to be going to the Divine Plan. Everything, that is, but for an unlikely angel and demon duo, who have been living on Earth for several millennia and have become rather fond of the place. If they are to prevent Armageddon they’ve got to find and kill the one who will bring it about: the Antichrist himself. There’s just one small problem: someone seems to have mislaid him..."

### [<cite>What My Best Friend Did</cite>, by Lucy Dawson, read by Georgia Maguire](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_587535&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

### [<cite>Heroes</cite>, written and read by Stephen Fry](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4289883)

> "There are Heroes - and then there are Greek Heroes. Few mere mortals have ever embarked on such bold and heart-stirring adventures, overcome myriad monstrous perils, or outwitted scheming vengeful gods, quite as stylishly and triumphantly as Greek heroes.

> "In this companion to his bestselling [<cite>Mythos</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3512899), Stephen Fry brilliantly retells these dramatic, funny, tragic and timeless tales. Join Jason aboard the Argo as he quests for the Golden Fleece. See Atalanta - who was raised by bears - outrun any man before being tricked with golden apples. Witness wily Oedipus solve the riddle of the Sphinx and discover how Bellerophon captures the winged horse Pegasus to help him slay the monster Chimera.

> "Filled with white-knuckle chases and battles, impossible puzzles and riddles, acts of base cowardice and real bravery, not to mention murders and selfless sacrifices, <cite>Heroes</cite> is the story of what we mortals are truly capable of - at our worst and our very best."

### [<cite>The Quaker</cite>, by Liam McIlvanney, read by Angus King](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3728188)

> "It is 1969 and Glasgow has been brought to its knees by a serial killer spreading fear throughout the city. The Quaker has taken three women from the same nightclub and brutally murdered them in the backstreets.

> "Soon another woman is found murdered in a run-down tenement flat. And McCormack follows a trail of secrets that will change the city – and his life – forever..."

### [<cite>The Silence of the Girls</cite>, by Pat Barker, read by Kristin Atherton](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3956046)

> "The great city of Troy is under siege as Greek heroes Achilles and Agamemnon wage bloody war over a stolen woman. In the Greek camp, another woman is watching and waiting: Briseis. She was a queen of this land until Achilles sacked her city and murdered her husband and sons. Now she is Achilles' concubine: a prize of battle.

> "Briseis is just one among thousands of women backstage in this war - the slaves and prostitutes, the nurses, the women who lay out the dead - all of them voiceless in history. But, though no one knows it yet, they are just ten weeks away from the death of Achilles and the Fall of Troy, an end to this long and bitter conflict. Briseis will see it all - and she will bear witness."

### [<cite>Erebus</cite>, written and read by Michael Palin](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3982067)

> "In September 2014 the wreck of a sailing vessel was discovered at the bottom of the sea in the frozen wastes of the Canadian Arctic. It was broken at the stern and covered in a woolly coat of underwater vegetation. Its whereabouts had been a mystery for over a century and a half. Its name was HMS Erebus.

> "Now Michael Palin – former Monty Python stalwart and much-loved television globetrotter – brings this extraordinary ship back to life, following it from its launch in 1826 to the epic voyages of discovery that led to glory in the Antarctic and to ultimate catastrophe in the Arctic. He explores the intertwined careers of the men who shared its journeys: the dashing James Clark Ross who charted much of the 'Great Southern Barrier' and oversaw some of the earliest scientific experiments to be conducted there; and the troubled John Franklin, who at the age of sixty and after a chequered career, commanded the ship on its final, disastrous expedition. And he vividly recounts the experiences of the men who first stepped ashore on Antarctica's Victoria Land, and those who, just a few years later, froze to death one by one in the Arctic wastes as rescue missions desperately tried to reach them."

### [<cite>The House Swap</cite>, by Rebecca Fleet, read by Sian Brooke](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3645210)

> "When Caroline and Francis receive an offer to house swap, they jump at the chance for a week away from home. After the difficulties of the past few years, they've worked hard to rebuild their marriage for their son's sake; now they want to reconnect as a couple.

> "On arrival, they find a house that is stark and sinister in its emptiness – it's hard to imagine what kind of person lives here. Then, gradually, Caroline begins to uncover some signs of life – signs of her life. The flowers in the bathroom or the music in the CD player might seem innocent to her husband but to her they are anything but. It seems the person they have swapped with is someone she used to know; someone she's desperate to leave in her past.

> "But that person is now in her home – and they want to make sure she'll never forget..."

### [<cite>Pulp</cite>, by Robin Talley, read by Stephanie Cannon](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4250051)

> "In 1955, eighteen-year-old Janet Jones keeps the love she shares with her best friend Marie a secret. It's not easy being gay in Washington, DC, in the age of McCarthyism, but when she discovers a series of books about women falling in love with other women, it awakens something in Janet. As she juggles a romance she must keep hidden and a newfound ambition to write and publish her own story, she risks exposing herself — and Marie — to a danger all too real.

> "Sixty-two years later, Abby Zimet can't stop thinking about her senior project and its subject: classic 1950s lesbian pulp fiction. Between the pages of her favourite book, the stresses of Abby's own life are lost to the fictional hopes, desires and tragedies of the characters she's reading about. She feels especially connected to one author, a woman who wrote under the pseudonym "Marian Love," and becomes determined to track her down and discover her true identity."

> "While the Blitz has united the nation, there is an enemy hiding in plain sight. A group of British citizens is gathering secret information to aid Hitler's war machine. Jack Hoste has become entangled in this treachery, but he also has a particular mission: to locate the most dangerous Nazi agent in the country.

> "Hoste soon receives a promising lead. Amy Strallen, who works in a Mayfair marriage bureau, was once close to this elusive figure. Her life is a world away from the machinations of Nazi sympathisers, yet when Hoste pays a visit to Amy's office, everything changes in a heartbeat.

> "Breathtakingly tense and trip-wired with surprises, <cite>Our Friends in Berlin</cite> is inspired by true events. It is a story about deception and loyalty – and about people in love who watch each other as closely as spies."

When a renegade necromancer wrenches him from eternal slumber and into a world gone terribly, bizarrely wrong, all Jim wants is to find a way to die properly, once and for all.

> "On his side, he's got a few shambling corpses, an inept thief, and a powerful death wish. But he's up against tough odds: angry mobs of adventurers, a body falling apart at the seams and a team of programmers racing a deadline to hammer out the last few bugs in their AI."

### [<cite>Size Matters Not</cite>, written and read by Warwick Davis](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/653944)

> "Actors work their entire careers hoping to achieve the kind of cult movie hero status that Davis achieved at the age of eleven playing Wicket W. Warrick, the lead ewok in <cite>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</cite>. In this lively and down-to-earth memoir, Davis offers personal stories on the making of some of the most popular films of the last few decades—including the Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Leprechaun movie franchises, among many others — and shares the unique perspective of life as experienced by someone with a one-in-a-million genetic condition."
