## [<cite>Akin</cite>, by Emma Donoghue](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4678171)

> "Noah is only days away from his first trip back to Nice since he was a child when a social worker calls looking for a temporary home for Michael, his eleven-year-old great-nephew. Though he has never met the boy, he gets talked into taking him along to France.

> "This odd couple, suffering from jet lag and culture shock, argue about everything from steak haché to screen time, and the trip is looking like a disaster. But as Michael's sharp eye and ease with tech help Noah unearth troubling details about their family's past, both come to grasp the risks that loved ones take for one another, and find they are more akin than they knew."

## [<cite>BOSH! How to Live Vegan</cite>, by Henry Firth & Ian Theasby](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4680786)

BOSH!, the pioneers of simple, easy and delicious plant-based cooking, are here to help and make a sustainable and ethical lifestyle accessible to everyone.

> "<cite>BOSH! How to Live Vegan</cite> covers all aspects of vegan living, everything from food to toiletries to travel. Should you be eating avocados? Is it still ok to wear an old leather belt? What do you tell your friends when they offer you a glass of non-vegan wine? Henry and Ian will answer these questions and more in this fully-comprehensive guide to a plant-based lifestyle.

> "Whether you are a committed vegan, looking to improve your vegan lifestyle or starting out for the first time, this book has all the know-how and inspiration you need."

## [<cite>A Day Like Today</cite>, by John Humphrys](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4639761)

> "For more than three decades, millions of Britons have woken to the sound of John Humphrys' voice. As presenter of Radio 4's <cite>Today</cite>, the nation's most popular news programme, he is famed for his tough interviewing, his deep misgivings about authority in its many forms and his passionate commitment to a variety of causes.

> "<cite>A Day Like Today</cite> charts John's journey from the poverty of his post-war childhood in Cardiff, leaving school at fifteen, to the summits of broadcasting. Humphrys was the BBC's youngest foreign correspondent; he was the first reporter at the catastrophe of Aberfan, an experience that marked him for ever; he was in the White House when Richard Nixon became the first American president to resign; in South Africa during the dying years of apartheid; and in war zones around the globe throughout his career. John was also the first journalist to present the <cite>Nine O'Clock News</cite> on television.

> "Humphrys pulls no punches and now, freed from the restrictions of being a BBC journalist, he reflects on the politicians he has interrogated and the controversies he has reported on and been involved in, including the interview that forced the resignation of his own boss, the director general. In typically candid style, he also weighs in on the role the BBC itself has played in our national life – for good and ill – and the broader health of the political system today."

## [<cite>Deadly Dance</cite>, by Hilary Bonner](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4733307)

> "DI David Vogel is first on the scene when Melanie Cooke's bruised and strangled body is discovered in Bristol's red-light district. The evidence points to Melanie's father being the killer, but Vogel's on edge. The quick arrest is too easy, too straightforward.

> "When two new murders are reported, Vogel's team broaden the search: new evidence suggests that there are three different, disturbed criminals. Any one of them could have killed Melanie, but which one did? Vogel's team inch towards the answer, never suspecting that the killer is watching them too, waiting for his moment to strike."

## [<cite>Cilka's Journey</cite>, by Heather Morris](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4957548)

> "In 1942 Cilka Klein is just sixteen years old when she is taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp. The Commandant at Birkenau, Schwarzhuber, notices her long beautiful hair, and forces her separation from the other women prisoners. Cilka learns quickly that power, even unwillingly given, equals survival.

> "After liberation, Cilka is charged as a collaborator by the Russians and sent to a desolate, brutal prison camp in Siberia known as Vorkuta, inside the Arctic Circle.
Innocent, imprisoned once again, Cilka faces challenges both new and horribly familiar, each day a battle for survival.

> "Cilka befriends a woman doctor, and learns to nurse the ill in the camp, struggling to care for them under unimaginable conditions. And when she tends to a man called Alexandr, Cilka finds that despite everything, there is room in her heart for love."

## [<cite>Find Me</cite>, by André Aciman](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4668376)

Sequel to [<cite>Call Me By Your Name</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/861098).

> "In <cite>Find Me</cite>, Aciman shows us Elio’s father, Samuel, on a trip from Florence to Rome to visit Elio, now a gifted classical pianist. A chance encounter on the train upends Sami’s visit and changes his life forever. Elio soon moves to Paris, where he, too, has a consequential affair, while Oliver, a New England college professor with a family, suddenly finds himself contemplating a return trip across the Atlantic."

## [<cite>The Life-Changing Manga of Tidying Up</cite>, by Marie Kondo & Yuko Uramoto](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4959914)

> "In <cite>The Life-Changing Manga of Tidying Up</cite>, Marie Kondo presents the fictional story of Chiaki, a young woman in Tokyo who struggles with a cluttered apartment, messy love life, and lack of direction. After receiving a complaint from her attractive next-door neighbour about the sad state of her balcony, Chiaki gets Kondo to take her on as a client. Through a series of entertaining and insightful lessons, Kondo helps Chiaki get her home - and life - in order.

> "This insightful, illustrated case study is perfect for people looking for a fun introduction to the KonMari Method of tidying up, as well as tried-and-true fans of Marie Kondo eager for a new way to think about what sparks joy. Featuring illustrations by award-winning manga artist Yuko Uramoto, this book also makes a great read for manga and graphic novel lovers of all ages."
