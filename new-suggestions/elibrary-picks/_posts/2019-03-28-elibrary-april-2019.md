## OverDrive eBooks

### [<cite>Adele</cite>, by Leila Slimani](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4347856?cid=243946)

> "Adèle appears to have the perfect life. A respected journalist, she lives in a flawless Parisian apartment with her surgeon husband and their young son. But beneath the veneer of 'having it all', she is bored - and consumed by an insatiable need for sex, whatever the cost.

> "Struggling to contain the twin forces of compulsion and desire, she begins to orchestrate her life around her one night stands and extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she's been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making."

### [<cite>If I Die Before I Wake</cite>, by Emily Koch](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3658215?cid=243946)

> "Everyone believes Alex is in a coma, unlikely to ever wake up. As his family debate withdrawing life support, he can only listen.

> "But he soon begins to suspect that his accident wasn't really an accident. Even worse, the perpetrator is still out there and Alex is not the only one in danger.

> "Alex must use a series of clues from his past to solve the mystery of who tried to kill him. He needs to protect those he loves – before they decide to let him go..."

### [<cite>Mad Blood Stirring</cite>, by Simon Mayo](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3910215?cid=243946)

> "On the eve of the year 1815, the American sailors of the Eagle finally arrive at Dartmoor prison; bedraggled, exhausted but burning with hope. They've only had one thing to sustain them – a snatched whisper overheard along the way: The war is over.

> "Joe Hill thought he'd left the war outside these walls but it's quickly clear that there's a different type of fight to be had within. The seven prison blocks surrounding him have been segregated; six white and one black. As his voice rings out across the courtyard, announcing the peace, the redcoat guards bristle and the inmates stir. The powder keg was already fixed to blow and Joe has just lit the fuse.

> "Elizabeth Shortland, wife of the Governor, looks down at the swirling crowd from the window of her own personal prison. The peace means the end is near, that she needn't be here for ever. But suddenly, she cannot bear the thought of leaving."

### [<cite>The Story of Brexit (A Ladybird Book)</cite>, by Jason Hazeley & Joel Morris](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4262433?cid=243946)

> "This delightful book is the latest in the series of Ladybird books which have been specially planned to help grown-ups with the world about them.

> "The large clear script, the careful choice of words, the frequent repetition and the thoughtful matching of text with pictures all enable grown-ups to think they have taught themselves to cope. Featuring original Ladybird artwork alongside brilliantly funny, brand new text."

### [<cite>An American Marriage</cite>, by Tayari Jones](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3901401?cid=243946)

> "Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of the American Dream. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. Until one day they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years for a crime Celestial knows he didn't commit.

> "Devastated and unmoored, Celestial finds herself struggling to hold on to the love that has been her centre, taking comfort in Andre, their closest friend. When Roy's conviction is suddenly overturned, he returns home ready to resume their life together."

### [<cite>The Priory of the Orange Tree</cite>, by Samantha Shannon](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4473301?cid=243946)

> "A world divided. A queendom without an heir. An ancient enemy awakens.

> "The House of Berethnet has ruled Inys for a thousand years. Still unwed, Queen Sabran the Ninth must conceive a daughter to protect her realm from destruction – but assassins are getting closer to her door.

> "Ead Duryan is an outsider at court. Though she has risen to the position of lady-in-waiting, she is loyal to a hidden society of mages. Ead keeps a watchful eye on Sabran, secretly protecting her with forbidden magic.

> "Across the dark sea, Tané has trained to be a dragonrider since she was a child, but is forced to make a choice that could see her life unravel.

> "Meanwhile, the divided East and West refuse to parley, and forces of chaos are rising from their sleep."

### [<cite>The Border</cite>, by Don Winslow](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4281483?cid=243946)

> "For more than forty years, Art Keller has been on the front lines of America's longest conflict: the war on drugs. His obsession with defeating the godfather of the Sinaloa Cartel – Adán Barrera – has cost him the people he loves, even taken a piece of his soul. Now Keller is elevated to the highest ranks of the DEA, only to find that in destroying one monster he has created thirty more that are wreaking chaos in his beloved Mexico.

> "And not just there. Fighting to end the heroin epidemic scourging America, Keller finds himself surrounded by an incoming administration that's in bed with the very drug traffickers that Keller is trying to bring down."

### [<cite>On the Front Line with the Women Who Fight Back</cite>, by Stacey Dooley](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3824428?cid=243946)

> "Over her ten years of documentary film making, Stacey Dooley has covered a variety of topics, from sex trafficking in Cambodia to Yazidi women fighting back in Syria.

> "At the heart of all her reporting are incredible women in extraordinary situations: sex workers in Russia, victims of domestic violence in Honduras, and many more.

> "<cite>On the Frontline with the Women who Fight Back</cite> draws on Stacey's encounters with the brave, wonderful women she has met over her career to explore the issues of gender equality, domestic violence, sexual identity and, at its centre, womanhood in the world today."

### [<cite>A Country Escape</cite>, by Katie Fforde](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/3702877?cid=243946)

> "Fran has always wanted to be a farmer. And now it looks as if her childhood dream is about to come true. She has just moved in to a beautiful but very run-down farm in the Cotswolds, currently owned by an old aunt who has told Fran that if she manages to turn the place around in a year, the farm will be hers.

> "But Fran knows nothing about farming. She might even be afraid of cows.

> "She's going to need a lot of help from her best friend Issi, and also from her wealthy and very eligible neighbour - who might just have his own reasons for being so supportive. Is it the farm he is interested in? Or Fran herself?"

### [<cite>Swan Song</cite>, by Kelleigh Greenberg-Jephcott](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4073356?cid=243946)

> "They told him everything.

> "He told everyone else.

> "Over countless martini-soaked Manhattan lunches, they shared their deepest secrets and greatest fears. On exclusive yachts sailing the Mediterranean, on private jets streaming towards Jamaica, on Yucatán beaches in secluded bays, they gossiped about sex, power, money, love and fame. They never imagined he would betray them so absolutely.

> "In the autumn of 1975, after two decades of intimate friendships, Truman Capote detonated a literary grenade, forever rupturing the elite circle he'd worked so hard to infiltrate. Why did he do it, knowing what he stood to lose? Was it to punish them? To make them pay for their manners, money and celebrated names? Or did he simply refuse to believe that they could ever stop loving him?

> "Whatever the motive, one thing remains indisputable: nine years after achieving wild success with <cite>In Cold Blood</cite>, Capote committed an act of professional and social suicide with his most lethal of weapons ... words."

### [<cite>War Doctor: surgery on the front line</cite>, by David Nott](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4263189?cid=243946)

> "For more than twenty-five years, David Nott has taken unpaid leave from his job as a general and vascular surgeon with the NHS to volunteer in some of the world's most dangerous war zones. From Sarajevo under siege in 1993, to clandestine hospitals in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, he has carried out life-saving operations and field surgery in the most challenging conditions, and with none of the resources of a major London teaching hospital.

> "The conflicts he has worked in form a chronology of twenty-first-century combat: Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Darfur, Congo, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Gaza and Syria. But he has also volunteered in areas blighted by natural disasters, such as the earthquakes in Haiti and Nepal.

> "Driven both by compassion and passion, the desire to help others and the thrill of extreme personal danger, he is now widely acknowledged to be the most experienced trauma surgeon in the world. But as time went on, David Nott began to realise that flying into a catastrophe – whether war or natural disaster – was not enough. Doctors on the ground needed to learn how to treat the appalling injuries that war inflicts upon its victims. Since 2015, the foundation he set up with his wife, Elly, has disseminated the knowledge he has gained, training other doctors in the art of saving lives threatened by bombs and bullets.

> "<cite>War Doctor</cite> is his extraordinary story."

### [<cite>The Wilderness</cite>, by Samantha Harvey](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/217873?cid=243946)

> "It's Jake's birthday. He has lost his wife, his son is in prison and he is about to lose his past. Jake has Alzheimer's.

> "As the disease takes hold of him, the key events of his life shift, and what until recently seemed solid fact melts into surreal imaginings. Is his daughter alive or long dead? And why exactly is his son in prison? There was a cherry tree once, and a yellow dress, but what do they mean? Is there anything he'll be able to salvage from the wreckage?"
