### [<cite>The Beekeeper of Aleppo</cite>, by Christy Lefteri, read by Art Malik](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BON_611654&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Nuri is a beekeeper; his wife, Afra, an artist. They live a simple life, rich in family and friends, in the beautiful Syrian city of Aleppo - until the unthinkable happens. When all they care for is destroyed by war, they are forced to escape.

> "Afra has lost her sight, and so they embark on a perilous journey towards an uncertain future in Britain. As they travel, Nuri is sustained by the knowledge that waiting for them is his beekeeper cousin Mustafa, who is teaching fellow refugees in Yorkshire to keep bees.

> "Nuri and Afra set off through a broken world, on a dangerous journey in which they will confront the pain of their unfathomable loss, and in doing so find a way back to each other again."

### [<cite>The Doll Factory</cite>, by Elizabeth Macneal, read by Tuppence Middleton](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=MDA_607483&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "London. 1850. The greatest spectacle the city has ever seen is being built in Hyde Park, and among the crowd watching two people meet.

> "When Iris is asked to model for pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint. Suddenly her world begins to expand, to become a place of art and love.

> "But Silas has only thought of one thing since their meeting, and his obsession is darkening..."

### [<cite>Enlightenment Now: the case for reason, science, humanism, and progress</cite>, by Steven Pinker, read by Arthur Morey](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_578716&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Is modernity really failing? Or have we failed to appreciate progress and the ideals that make it possible?

> "If you follow the headlines, the world in the 21st century appears to be sinking into chaos, hatred and irrationality. Yet, as Steven Pinker shows, if you follow the trendlines, you discover that our lives have become longer, healthier, safer and more prosperous - not just in the West, but worldwide. Such progress is no accident: it's the gift of a coherent value system that many of us embrace without even realizing it. These are the values of the Enlightenment: of reason, science, humanism and progress.

> "The challenges we face today are formidable. But the way to deal with them is not to sink into despair or try to lurch back to a mythical idyllic past; it's to treat them as problems we can solve, as we have solved other problems in the past. This is the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century."

### [<cite>The Forgotten Sister</cite>, by Caroline Bond, read by Emma Harrold](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_617859&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

In uncovering her real identity Cassie learns her adoptive parents have kept a terrible secret from her her whole life, which now threatens to destroy everything she has ever held dear."

### [<cite>Homo Deus: a brief history of tomorrow</cite>, by Yuval Noah Harari, read by Derek Perkins](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_568373&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "During the 20th century, humankind has managed to do the impossible: we have brought famine, plague and war under control. Today, more people die from obesity than from starvation; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed in war. We are the only species in earth’s long history that has single-handedly changed the entire planet, and we no longer expect any higher being to shape our destinies for us.

> "As the self-made gods of planet earth, which projects should we undertake, and how will we protect this fragile planet and humankind itself from our own destructive powers? Yuval Noah Harari examines the implications of our newly acquired divine capabilities, from our desperate pursuit of happiness to our dogged quest for immortality."

> "When DS Joanna Harper picks up the list of overnight incidents that have been reported, she expects the usual calls from drunks and wrong numbers. But then a report of an attempted abduction catches her eye. The only thing is that it was flagged as a false alarm just fifteen minutes later.

> "Harper's superior officer tells her there's no case here, but Harper can’t let it go so she visits the hospital anyway. There's nothing on the CCTV. No one believes this woman was ever there. And yet, Lauren claims that she keeps seeing the woman and that her babies are in danger, and soon Harper is sucked into Lauren's spiral of fear. But how far will they go to save children who may not even be in danger?"
