### [<cite>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</cite>, by Yuval Noah Harari, read by Derek Perkins](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_574786&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "How can we protect ourselves from nuclear war, ecological cataclysms and technological disruptions? What can we do about the epidemic of fake news or the threat of terrorism? What should we teach our children?

> "Yuval Noah Harari takes us on a thrilling journey through today’s most urgent issues. The golden thread running through his exhilarating new book is the challenge of maintaining our collective and individual focus in the face of constant and disorienting change. Are we still capable of understanding the world we have created?"

### [<cite>Brooklyn</cite>, by Colm Tóibin, read by Niamh Cusack](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_565671&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "It is Ireland in the early 1950s and for Eilis Lacey, as for so many young Irish girls, opportunities are scarce. So when her sister arranges for her to emigrate to New York, Eilis knows she must go, leaving behind her family and her home for the first time.

> "Arriving in a crowded lodging house in Brooklyn, Eilis can only be reminded of what she has sacrificed. She is far from home - and homesick. And just as she takes tentative steps towards friendship, and perhaps something more, Eilis receives news which sends her back to Ireland. There she will be confronted by a terrible dilemma - a devastating choice between duty and one great love."

### [<cite>Dear Evan Hansen</cite>, by Benj Pasek, Justin Paul, Steven Levenson & Val Emmich, read by Ben Levi Ross](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_579634&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "When a letter that was never meant to be seen by anyone draws high school senior Evan Hansen into a family's grief over the loss of their son, he is given the chance of a lifetime: to belong. He just has to stick to a lie he never meant to tell, that the notoriously troubled Connor Murphy was his secret best friend.

> "Suddenly, Evan isn't invisible anymore - even to the girl of his dreams. And Connor Murphy's parents, with their beautiful home on the other side of town, have taken him in like he was their own, desperate to know more about their enigmatic son from his closest friend. As Evan gets pulled deeper into their swirl of anger, regret, and confusion, he knows that what he's doing can't be right, but if he's helping people, how wrong can it be?

> "No longer tangled in his once-incapacitating anxiety, this new Evan has a purpose. And a website. He's confident. He's a viral phenomenon. Every day is amazing. Until everything is in danger of unraveling and he comes face to face with his greatest obstacle: himself."

### [<cite>How to be Human</cite>, by Ruby Wax, read by Ruby Wax, Ash Ranpura & Gelong Thubten](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_576652&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "It took us 4 billion years to evolve to where we are now. No question, anyone reading this has won the evolutionary Hunger Games by the fact you're on all twos and not some fossil. This should make us all the happiest species alive - most of us aren't, what's gone wrong? We've started treating ourselves more like machines and less like humans. We're so used to upgrading things like our iPhones: as soon as the new one comes out, we don't think twice, we dump it. (Many people I know are now on iWife4 or iHusband8, the motto being, if it's new, it's better.)

> "We can't stop the future from arriving, no matter what drugs we're on. But even if nearly every part of us becomes robotic, we'll still, fingers crossed, have our minds, which, hopefully, we'll be able use for things like compassion, rather than chasing what's 'better', and if we can do that we're on the yellow brick road to happiness.

> "I wrote this book with a little help from a monk, who explains how the mind works, and also gives some mindfulness exercises, and a neuroscientist who explains what makes us 'us' in the brain. We answer every question you've ever had about: evolution, thoughts, emotions, the body, addictions, relationships, kids, the future and compassion."

### [<cite>The Language of Kindness: a nurse's story</cite>, written and read by Christie Watson](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_565351&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Christie Watson was a nurse for twenty years. Taking us from birth to death and from A&E to the mortuary, <cite>The Language of Kindness</cite> is an astonishing account of a profession defined by acts of care, compassion and kindness.

> "We watch Christie as she nurses a premature baby who has miraculously made it through the night, we stand by her side during her patient’s agonising heart-lung transplant, and we hold our breath as she washes the hair of a child fatally injured in a fire, attempting to remove the toxic smell of smoke before the grieving family arrive."

### [<cite>A Legacy of Spies</cite>, by John le Carré, read by Tom Hollander](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_576917&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Peter Guillam, former disciple of George Smiley in the British Secret Service, has long retired to Brittany when a letter arrives, summoning him to London. The reason? Cold War ghosts have come back to haunt him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of the Service are to be dissected by a generation with no memory of the Berlin Wall. Somebody must pay for innocent blood spilt in the name of the greater good..."

### [<cite>The Mars Room</cite>, written and read by Rachel Kushner](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_574816&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Romy Hall is at the start of two consecutive life sentences, plus six years, at Stanville Women’s Correctional Facility. Outside is the world from which she has been permanently severed: the San Francisco of her youth, changed almost beyond recognition. The Mars Room strip club where she once gave lap dances for a living. And her seven-year-old son, Jackson, now in the care of Romy’s estranged mother.

> "Inside is a new reality to adapt to: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive. The deadpan absurdities of institutional living, which Kushner details with humour and precision. Daily acts of violence by guards and prisoners alike. Allegiances formed over liquor brewed in socks, and stories shared through sewage pipes.

> "Romy sees the future stretch out ahead of her in a long, unwavering line – until news from outside brings a ferocious urgency to her existence, challenging her to escape her own destiny and culminating in a climax of almost unbearable intensity."

### [<cite>The Mistake</cite>, by K. L. Slater, read by Lucy Price-Lewis](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_585357&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Eight-year-old Billy goes missing one day, out flying his kite with his sister Rose. Two days later, he is found dead.

> "Sixteen years on, Rose still blames herself for Billy’s death. How could she have failed to protect her little brother?

> "Rose has never fully recovered from the trauma, and one of the few people she trusts is her neighbour Ronnie, who she has known all her life. But one day Ronnie falls ill, and Rose goes next door to help him... and what she finds in his attic room turns her world upside down.

> "Rose thought she knew the truth about what happened to Billy. She thought she knew her neighbour. Now the only thing she knows is that she is in danger..."

### [<cite>Roaring Forties</cite>, written and read by Ed Byrne](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=RBE_501087&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Ed Byrne is now one of the most successful comedians around. A familiar face - and voice - on many TV programmes, he has appeared in all of the best-known shows and, with great friend Dara Ó Briain, starred in Dara and Ed's Big Adventure, about their journey along the Pan-American Highway. This great show was recorded live."

### [<cite>The Rosie Project</cite>, by Graeme Simsion, read by Dan O'Grady](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_559551&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Meet Don. Don is a genetics professor who just might be somewhere on the autistic spectrum. He looks a little like Gregory Peck and is getting married. He just doesn't know who to yet. But he has designed a very detailed questionnaire to help him find the perfect woman.

> "And it's definitely not Rosie. Absolutely, completely, definitely not.

> "Rosie, meanwhile, isn't looking for love; she's looking for her biological father.
Sometimes, though, you don't find love; love finds you..."

### [<cite>The Secret History</cite>, written and read by Donna Tartt](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_559629&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "A misfit at an exclusive New England college, Richard finds kindred spirits in the five eccentric students of his ancient Greek class. But his new friends have a horrific secret.

> "When blackmail and violence threaten to blow their privileged lives apart, they drag Richard into the nightmare that engulfs them. And soon they enter a terrifying heart of darkness from which they may never return..."
