> "They have almost no money for food or shelter and must carry only the essentials for survival on their backs as they live wild in the ancient, weathered landscape of cliffs, sea and sky. Yet through every step, every encounter, and every test along the way, their walk becomes a remarkable journey."

### [<cite>The Way of All Flesh</cite>, by Ambrose Parry, read by Bryan Dick & Louise Brealey](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=CGA_659049&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Simpson's patients range from the richest to the poorest of this divided city. His house is like no other, full of visiting luminaries and daring experiments in the new medical frontier of anaesthesia. It is here that Raven meets housemaid Sarah Fisher, who recognises trouble when she sees it and takes an immediate dislike to him. She has all of his intelligence but none of his privileges, in particular his medical education.

> "With each having their own motive to look deeper into these deaths, Raven and Sarah find themselves propelled headlong into the darkest shadows of Edinburgh's underworld, where they will have to overcome their differences if they are to make it out alive."

> "But there is trouble in paradise. Kate suspects that her husband is having an affair, and that the other woman is one of her best friends.

> "They were the new icons of rock and roll, fated to burn bright and not fade away. But on 12 July 1979, it all came crashing down.

> "There was Daisy, rock and roll force of nature, brilliant songwriter and unapologetic drug addict, the half-feral child who rose to superstardom. There was Camila, the frontman’s wife, too strong-willed to let the band implode – and all too aware of the electric connection between her husband and Daisy. There was Karen, ice-cool keyboardist, a ferociously independent woman in a world that wasn’t ready for her.

> "And there were the men surrounding them: the feuding, egotistical Dunne brothers, the angry guitarist chafing on the sidelines, the drummer binge-drinking on his boat, the bassist trying to start a family amid a hedonistic world tour. They were creative minds striking sparks from each other, ready to go up in flames.

> "It’s never just about the music..."

### [<cite>Once Upon a River</cite>, by Diane Setterfield, read by Juliet Stevenson](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_625142&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

### [<cite>Diary of a Drag Queen</cite>, by Crystal Rasmussen, read by Tom Rasmussen](https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=PRH_645160&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172)

> "Crystal writes candidly about her search for ‘the one’; sleeping with an editor in an attempt to become a world famous journalist; getting hired and fired by a well-known fashion magazine; being torn between losing weight and gorging on KFC; and her need for constant sexual satisfaction (and where that takes her).

> "Charting her day-to-day adventures over the course of a year, we encounter tucks, twists and sucks, heinous overspending and endless nights spent sprinting from problem to problem in a full face of makeup.

> "This is a place where the previously unspeakable becomes the commendable – a unique portrayal of the queer experience."

> "Following the lost boy's scent from one ancient city to another, into dense forests and across deep rivers, Tracker starts to wonder: Who is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And most important of all, who is telling the truth and who is lying?

> "Drawing from vivid African history and mythology, Marlon James weaves a saga of breathtaking adventure and powerful intrigue - a mesmerizing, unique meditation on the nature of truth and power."

### [<cite>Boy Swallows Universe</cite>, by Trent Dalton, read by Stig Wemyss](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4281988)

> "Brisbane, 1983: A lost father, a mute brother, a mum in jail, a heroin dealer for a stepfather and a notorious criminal for a babysitter. It's not as if Eli's life isn't complicated enough already. He's just trying to follow his heart, learning what it takes to be a good man, but life just keeps throwing obstacles in the way – not least of which is Tytus Broz, legendary drug dealer.

> "But Eli's life is about to get a whole lot more serious. He's about to fall in love. And he has to break into prison on Christmas Day, to save his mum."

### [<cite>The Confessions of Frannie Langton</cite>, written and read by Sara Collins](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4184280)

> "They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don't believe I've done?

> "1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning - slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth.

> "But they are not the whole truth. For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed. But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?"

### [<cite>Doggerland</cite>, by Ben Smith, read by Peter Noble](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4335556)

> "In the North Sea, far from what remains of the coastline, a wind farm stretches for thousands of acres.

> "The Boy, who is no longer really a boy, and the Old Man, whose age is unguessable, are charged with its maintenance. They carry out their never-ending work, scoured by wind and salt, as the waves roll, dragging strange shoals of flotsam through the turbine fields. Land is only a memory.

> "So too is the Boy’s father, who worked on the turbines before him, and disappeared. The boy has been sent by the Company to take his place, but the question of where he went and why is one for which the Old Man will give no answer.

> "As his companion dredges the sea for lost things, the Boy sifts for the truth of his missing father. Until one day, from the limitless water, a plan for escape emerges..."

### [<cite>The Glass Woman</cite>, by Caroline Lea, read by Smari Gunn & Heiða Reed](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4331021)

> "1686, Iceland. An isolated, windswept landscape.

> "Rósa is newly betrothed to Jón.

> "Alone and far from home, Rósa sees the darkness coming. She fears she will be its next victim..."

### [<cite>The Librarian of Auschwitz</cite>, by Antonio Iturbe & Lilit Zekulin Thwaites (trans.), read by Marisa Calin Thwaites](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4595638)

> "Fourteen-year-old Dita is one of the many imprisoned by the Nazis at Auschwitz. Taken, along with her mother and father, from the Terezín ghetto in Prague, Dita is adjusting to the constant terror that is life in the camp. When Jewish leader Freddy Hirsch asks Dita to take charge of the eight precious books the prisoners have managed to smuggle past the guards, she agrees.

> "And so Dita becomes the secret librarian of Auschwitz, responsible for the safekeeping of the small collection of titles, as well as the 'living books' - prisoners of Auschwitz who know certain books so well, they too can be 'borrowed' to educate the children in the camp.

> "But books are extremely dangerous. They make people think. And nowhere are they more dangerous than in Block 31 of Auschwitz, the children's block, where the slightest transgression can result in execution, no matter how young the transgressor..."

### [<cite>Lost Children Archive</cite>, by Valeria Luiselle, read by Kivlighan de Montebello](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4265168)

> "Suppose you and Pa were gone, and we were lost. What would happen then?

> "A family in New York packs the car and sets out on a road trip. A mother, a father, a boy and a girl, they head south west, to the Apacheria, the regions of the US which used to be Mexico. They drive for hours through desert and mountains. They stop at diners when they’re hungry and sleep in motels when it gets dark. The little girl tells surreal knock knock jokes and makes them all laugh. The little boy educates them all and corrects them when they’re wrong. The mother and the father are barely speaking to each other."

### [<cite>The Mars Room</cite>, written and read by Rachel Kushner](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4184326)

> "Romy Hall is at the start of two consecutive life sentences, plus six years, at Stanville Women’s Correctional Facility. Outside is the world from which she has been permanently severed: the San Francisco of her youth, changed almost beyond recognition. The Mars Room strip club where she once gave lap dances for a living. And her seven-year-old son, Jackson, now in the care of Romy’s estranged mother. Inside is a new reality to adapt to: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive. These are the deadpan absurdities of institutional living, which Kushner details with humour and precision."

### [<cite>The Secretary</cite>, by Renée Knight, read by Victoria Hamilton](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4184332)

> "Look around you. Who holds the most power in the room? Is it the one who speaks loudest, who looks the part, who has the most money, who commands the most respect?

> "Or perhaps it's someone like Christine Butcher: a meek, overlooked figure, who silently bears witness as information is shared and secrets are whispered. Someone who quietly, perhaps even unwittingly, gathers together knowledge of the people she's there to serve – the ones who don't notice her, the ones who consider themselves to be important.

> "There's a fine line between loyalty and betrayal. And when someone like Christine Butcher is pushed to her limit, she might just become the most dangerous person in the room..."

### [<cite>The Snakes</cite>, by Sadie Jones, read by Abigail Thaw](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4361951)

> "Bea and Dan, recently married, rent out their tiny flat to escape London for a few precious months. Driving through France they visit Bea's dropout brother Alex at the hotel he runs in Burgundy. Disturbingly, they find him all alone and the ramshackle hotel deserted, apart from the nest of snakes in the attic.

> "When Alex and Bea's parents make a surprise visit, Dan can't understand why Bea is so appalled, or why she's never wanted him to know them; Liv and Griff Adamson are charming, and rich. They are the richest people he has ever met. Maybe Bea's ashamed of him, or maybe she regrets the secrets she's been keeping.

> "Tragedy strikes suddenly, brutally, and in its aftermath the family is stripped back to its heart, and then its rotten core, and even Bea with all her strength and goodness can't escape."
