Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, library and information advisor Helen Kerridge recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1637612"><cite>Mindfulness in Eight Weeks</cite></a>, by Michael Chaskalson.

An excellent introduction to the subject of how to introduce the ancient skill of Mindfulness into your life and how to progressively allow its potential to help you deal differently and more positively with stress. The writing style is easy to read and it is extremely well referenced.
