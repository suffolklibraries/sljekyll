Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Leiston Library manager Gayla Rowling recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1983205"><cite>Fresh India: 130 quick, easy and delicious vegetarian recipes for every day</cite></a>, by Meera Sodha.

I'll be giving this to my partner who's borrowed it from Suffolk Libraries and cooked some amazing food using Meera Sodha's recipes.  They're traditional Indian vegetarian recipes with a British twist. I will be looking forward to a New Year of having yummy food cooked for me...
