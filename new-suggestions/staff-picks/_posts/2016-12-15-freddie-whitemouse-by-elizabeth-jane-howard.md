Poor discontented Freddie Whitemouse, who lives at number 16, Skirting Board West with his large family, wants to be anything but a mouse.

Mice are small and afraid of everything and Freddie feels he isn't allowed to have any fun of any kind. Instead Freddie can imagine himself as a fierce jungle tiger or a family's much loved pet dog. So when a sorcerer toad hears his pleas and offers his assistance, there is little else Freddie can do but agree.

He is sensible enough, however, to keep his options open and initially agrees to a week trial period as each animal. What adventures will he have, and will he discover that a little mouse can be braver than he thinks?

The writing is old-fashioned yet beautiful throughout, displaying a pleasing gentleness that builds to a genuinely heart-warming conclusion. Ideal for children everywhere!

<cite>The Amazing Adventures of Freddie Whitemouse</cite> is the charming first children's book from critically acclaimed author, Elizabeth Jane Howard, who died in 2014 and was a famous patron of Bungay Library.
