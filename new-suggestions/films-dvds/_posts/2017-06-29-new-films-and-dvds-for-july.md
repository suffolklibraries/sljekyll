## [<cite>Beauty and the Beast</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2242827)

> "Bill Condon co-writes and directs this fantasy adaptation of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's fairy tale which stars Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the title roles.

> "When a prince is turned into a hideous beast by a magical spell, he finds that the only way out of his predicament is to win the love of the beautiful Belle (Watson). Belle agrees to stay at his castle in exchange for the freedom of her father, whom the Beast (Stevens) had previously captured after finding him in the castle grounds.

> "At first she is repulsed by his hideous features, but as time passes she learns to recognise his true inner beauty, much to the disgust of local hunter Gaston (Luke Evans), who wants to take Belle for himself. In a fit of jealous rage, Gaston rallies the local villagers into a mob by convincing them that the Beast is an evil monster, and attempts to storm the castle in a bid to get rid of him once and for all."

When Tim discovers that the baby can not only talk but is also the head of a secret organisation of babies plotting to escape their mundane lives, Tim himself tries to escape in order to tell his parents and reclaim their affection.

> "When the baby uncovers a plot by the CEO of Puppy Co. however, Tim puts his truth-telling on hold to help save the world from the evil Francis E. Francis (Buscemi)."

> "It's the year 2024 and Logan's age is finally catching up with him, with his ability to heal rapidly slowing. When Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), whose advancing years are also causing issues with his abilities, tells Logan of a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), who has been cloned from Wolverine's DNA, they realise that she may be their only hope of saving the world from the evil corporation that is set on destroying everything in its path."

## [<cite>Kong: Skull Island</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2244071)

> "Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson star in this action adventure reboot that tells the origin story of giant gorilla Kong.

> "For decades, Bill Randa (John Goodman) has hunted for the proof he needs to convince the world of what he already knows: monsters are real. And in a group of US servicemen commanded by Lt. Col. Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), he thinks he has found the opportunity to get it. The crew, including photographer Weaver (Larson) and Cpt. James Conrad (Hiddleston), set out for a remote island in the Pacific shrouded in mystery. But when they arrive, they are met with the unassailable Kong. Packard confronts Randa, demanding he reveal what he knows before they are all slaughtered.

> "Caught between the fearsome Kong who rules the island and the terrifying creatures that live below, the group must act quickly if they are to survive, and if Randa is to finally reveal the secret of the giant gorilla to the world."

> "With their relationship becoming serious, Rose (Williams) invites her African-American boyfriend Chris (Kaluuya) to meet her parents Missy and Dean (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford) as part of a weekend getaway at her family home. Initially, Chris thinks that the family's overly friendly behaviour is due to their nervousness about their daughter's interracial relationship, but when he then finds out that a number of black people have recently gone missing in the neighbourhood, he begins to realise there is something much more sinister going on."

## [<cite>Hidden Figures</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2157664)

> "As NASA's leading minds struggle to work out complicated maths problems in the lead-up to the launch of John Glenn (Glen Powell)'s Apollo 11 space mission, the Agency brings in a group of African-American women with the reputation of being human computers. As Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer), Katherine Johnson (Henson) and Mary Jackson (Janelle MonaÃÅe) put their brains to the test, calculating the flight trajectories for Project Mercury and the mission to the moon, their jobs must be done while also trying to prove wrong those who think women, especially black women, do not belong in the workplace."
