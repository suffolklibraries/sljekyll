> "Olivia Colman stars in this bawdy period drama directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

> "Queen Anne (Colman) may occupy the throne but it is her co-dependent, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who makes most of the Monarch's decisions, leaving The Queen to get on with eating pineapples and racing ducks.

> "When Lady Sarah's cousin, Abigal Masham (Emma Stone), arrives and is given work at the palace as a servant she quickly endears herself to The Queen and threatens Lady Sarah's status as the favourite. Lady Sarah cannot hide her jealously and a bitter and petty rivalry ensues as both ladies vie for The Queen's affections."

> "After marrying Parisian writer Henry Gauthier-Villars (Dominic West), Gabrielle Colette moves to the French capital where she writes her first novel, an autobiographical tale entitled 'Claudine', which is published under her husband's pen name, Willy, and becomes an instant bestseller. The novel's success thrusts the couple's scandalous marriage into the spotlight and inspires a further series of stories.
