Having grown up to become obsessed by the eccentric character he played in the 1980s, Bratt has hatched a scheme for world domination and will seemingly do anything to achieve his goal. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, it once again falls to the unique talents of Gru and his Minions to step up to the plate and save the day."

When he meets with Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), a seasoned superhero who tries to pass on some words of wisdom, Peter is told that his priority should be working hard at school to get good grades, not donning his Spider-Man suit and fighting crime, but for Peter the urge to stop bad guys is just too overwhelming and he tries to find a way to do both."
