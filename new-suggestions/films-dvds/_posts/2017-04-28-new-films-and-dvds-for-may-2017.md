> "Damien Chazelle writes and directs this romantic musical starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Aspiring actress Mia (Stone) and jazz musician Sebastian (Gosling) are both down on their luck in Los Angeles, a city of broken dreams. Tired of being rejected in auditions and reduced to serving stars their coffees, Mia stumbles into a jazz club to the entrancing melody of a piano being played within; there she finds Sebastian, who is being discarded by his boss. The two soon fall in love as they strive to truly make something of themselves. But the rocky road of pursuing their dreams may prove too much strain for their budding romance to bear."

Winner of five BAFTAs, seven Golden Globe Awards and six Academy Awards.

> "Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is the highly optimistic koala proprieter of a venerable theatre. But as the splendour of his theatre begins to fade and Buster's life ambition with it, he must quickly devise a way to save his playhouse. Despite the reservations of his sheep friend Eddie (John C. Reilly), Buster decides to hold a singing contest in the hopes of raising enough money and attention to save his ailing theatre.

> "With most of the town signing up to take part, the most promising contestants are Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), an overworked pig housewife, Mike (Seth MacFarlane), an arrogant, larger-than-life mouse, Ashley (Scarlett Johansson), a punk-rock porcupine, Meena (Tori Kelly), a stage-frightened elephant, and Johnny (Taron Egerton), a British gorilla pressured by his father's criminal exploits. How will they fare? And will Buster be able to save his theatre?"

When more than 5,000 people volunteer to help set up a new colony on a faraway planet known as Homestead II, they board the Starship Avalon spaceship and embark on their 120-year journey, throughout which they will settle into a cryogenic sleep.

> "When two of the sleep chambers malfunction and awaken passengers Jim (Pratt) and Aurora (Lawrence) just 30 years into their voyage, they are faced with the prospect of dying alone before reaching the planet, with just each other and robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) for company. When they realise that there is something wrong with the ship, they must work together if they are to have any chance of saving the thousands of people on board."

> "Andrew Garfield and Sam Worthington star in this biographical drama directed by Mel Gibson. The film recounts the heroism of conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) amid the blood and thunder of the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. When most in his town are enlisted to the army, Doss is motivated to sign up as well. However, due to his beliefs, he refuses to handle a weapon and instead intends to serve in the field as a medic.

> "After campaigning to be allowed to go into battle unarmed, Doss is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and sent to Okinawa to fight under Captain Glover (Worthington). With the American forces suffering severe casualties in their assault on the Japanese, Doss springs into action by selflessly putting himself in the line of fire in a heroic attempt to save the lives of his injured comrades."

> "This fantasy drama adaptation is directed by J.A. Bayona and written by Patrick Ness. Young Conor (Lewis MacDougall) struggles to deal with his mother (Felicity Jones)'s terminal illness, the heartless grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) he must stay with, and the bullying he receives at school from Harry (James Melville).

> "Gripped by guilt, anger and fear, Conor is given support from a quite unlikely source: a drawing of a great, ancient tree monster (voice of Liam Neeson) that comes to life. The monster visits Conor at night to tell him stories and help him come to terms with his difficult situation. With the monster at his back, Conor faces his problems directly with courage and conviction."
