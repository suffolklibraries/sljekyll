In 1961, Bailey, a Golden Retriever puppy, is adopted by a young boy named Ethan (Quaid/K.J. Apa/Bryce Gheisar), who quickly falls in love with his new pet. As the years pass, Bailey grows up alongside Ethan until his family regretfully have to get him put down in old age.

> "However, Bailey soon wakes up in the body of a young, female dog named Ellie who works for the Chicago Police Department before being reincarnated again as a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, all the while remembering each of his past lives. When he is again reincarnated as an abusive couple's new pet, Bailey heads back to the old town he used to live in with Ethan, where he might finally find the purpose he's always longed for in life."
