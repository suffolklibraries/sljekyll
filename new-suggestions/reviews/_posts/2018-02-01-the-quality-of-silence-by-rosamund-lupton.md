> "On 24th November Yasmin and her deaf daughter Ruby arrived in Alaska. Within hours they were driving alone across a frozen wilderness where nothing grows, where no one lives, where tears freeze and night will last for another 54 days. They are looking for Ruby's father. Travelling deeper into a silent land. They still cannot find him. And someone is watching them in the dark."

<cite>The Quality of Silence</cite> makes a jolly good read for a book group as it has a bit of everything. The story is thrilling, tingles with suspense, features really well-written relationships, including romance, and is beautifully expressive.

The setting of Alaska is both atmospheric and dramatic and this unusual and alien environment adds to the intensity of the thriller as well as conveying an ecological message.

This story is enriched with some lovely characters, and the way the story unfolds through Yasmin and Ruby is well handled. Ruby helps both her mother and father rediscover themselves, and is portrayed in a remarkable way. Lupton draws upon her own experience of deafness to perceptively and descriptively reveal how a deaf person senses the world.

We thoroughly recommend this gripping book.
