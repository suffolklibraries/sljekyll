**[See <cite>Anatomy of a Scandal</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2407274)**

In <cite>Anatomy of a Scandal</cite>, a successful, good-looking and charismatic politician is accused of rape. The prosecuting lawyer at his trial knows that the clues to his culpability are in his background as an Oxford undergraduate.

We unanimously agreed that this was a readable and thought-provoking page-turner, dealing with topical issues. We enjoyed the unexpected twists in the plot and well-rounded characterisation, especially that of barrister Kate, who became part of the establishment in order to beat it.

We identified with all the female characters and the political situation described resonated with us. In the words of one of our group, "thank heavens for this book."
