In <cite>The Stopped Heart</cite>, two stories intertwine. In the present day, Mary and Graham have moved to a house in the Suffolk countryside following the tragic death of their two daughters. In the 19th century, 13-year-old Eliza and her large farming family's lives take a dramatic turn after James, a mysterious red-haired stranger, starts working on the farm after he is nearly crushed to death by their tree during a storm.

<cite>The Stopped Heart</cite> is a brilliant novel I was reluctant to finish. It features the kind of paranormal occurrences I really enjoy reading about: ghostly apparitions, timeslips and a small child talking about people and events she could not possibly have any knowledge of and seeing things other people can't.

I thought that Myerson's frequent alternating between the two stories worked well, especially because they were linked by location and ghostly apparitions. I found the novel very difficult to put down due to the author's technique of releasing information sparingly over the course of the book; I wanted to read on to find out more about Mary and Graham's lost daughters in particular. Lots of Suffolk locations are mentioned in the book - Framlingham Library gets a reference!

There were some disturbing, graphic scenes, and I'd warn more sensitive readers to be aware of those. I did feel that these were necessary as they served to build up James' menace, threat and evil very well, heightening the tension until his final, shocking acts of violence.

Overall, <cite>The Stopped Heart</cite> is a particularly eerie and resonant example of a ghost story, but it also works well as a novel as Myerson has masterfully created an excellent cast of complex characters, skilfully weaved two rich stories together, and keeps surprising the reader throughout.
