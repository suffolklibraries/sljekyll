In <cite>The Stopped Heart</cite>, two stories intertwine. In the present day, Mary and Graham have moved to a house in the Suffolk countryside following the tragic death of their two daughters. In the 19th century, 13-year-old Eliza and her large farming family's lives are changed by James, a mysterious red-haired stranger who is nearly crushed to death by their tree during a storm and stays on to work as a labourer.

Mary and Graham have to deal with their grief as well as Ruby, Graham's troubled teenage daughter from a previous marriage, and an overly-friendly neighbour. Eliza is abused and manipulated by James, whose dark character and capabilities soon become very evident. The stories bleed into one another as Eliza's 4-year-old sister, Lottie, eerily describes Mary and Ruby, and they in turn are spooked by sightings of James and the children.

<cite>The Stopped Heart</cite> is a brilliant novel I was reluctant to finish. It features the kind of paranormal occurrences I particularly enjoy reading about: ghostly apparitions, timeslips and small children talking about people and events they could not possibly have any knowledge of and seeing things other people can't see.

I thought that Myerson's frequent alternating between the two stories worked well, not least because they were linked by location and apparitions. I found the novel very difficult to put down due to her technique of releasing information sparingly over the course of the book; I wanted to read on to find out more about Mary and Graham's lost daughters in particular. Lots of Suffolk locations are mentioned in the book - Framlingham Library gets a reference!

There were some disturbing, graphic scenes, and I'd warn more sensitive readers to be aware of those. I did feel that they served to build up James' menace, threat and evil very well, heightening the tension until his final, shocking acts of violence.

Overall, <cite>The Stopped Heart</cite> is a particularly eerie and resonant example of a ghost story, but it also works well as a novel as Myerson has masterfully created an excellent cast of complex characters, skilfully weaved two rich stories together, and keeps surprising the reader throughout.
