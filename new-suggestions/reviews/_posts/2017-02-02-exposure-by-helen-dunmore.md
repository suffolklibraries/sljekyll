**[See <cite>Exposure</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2014816).**

In <cite>Exposure</cite>, a seemingly ordinary family is torn apart when Simon responds to a request by a homosexual lover from the past. As his lover lies ill in hospital, Simon is imprisoned on charges of espionage, and more fearful of personal scandal.

This can be read as a 1960s spy thriller but is also a story of love and commitment, concentrating on the way Simon's wife and children deal with difficult circumstances.

One of the group thought it was written from a modern perspective and did not reflect the 60s, but others found it a real page-turner, and empathised with all the characters in the family.

We discussed the different levels of exposure in the novel and the how our attitudes to sexuality had changed in the last 50 years.
