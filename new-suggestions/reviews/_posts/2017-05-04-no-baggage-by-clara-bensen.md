One dress, three weeks, eight countries, zero baggage.

This book is a modern romance travelogue: a lighthearted read which will leaving you wander-lusting.

Initially intrigued by how someone could travel for weeks with only one outfit and no baggage, I was quickly captivated by what I was reading. Clara's adventures seemed to happily slot into place without the need of forward planning and organisation.

<cite>No Baggage</cite> was very refreshing to read, describing a simpler and relaxed way of travelling. By travelling this way, Clara found interesting places and experiences by accident, making her adventures even more exciting.

A perfect read for anyone interested in travelling and exploring new places.
