Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today is a little different, as library and information advisor Andrew Miller recommends the board game <cite>Ticket To Ride: Europe</cite>, which can be hired from the branch's Board Games Library.

Travel to the great cities of Europe by steam train with this fun, easy-to-learn board game. Suitable for all the family with simple rules, lovely art work and plastic trains! My family and friends have played this many, many times with plenty of laughter, and the games finish with a "shall we have another go?!"

Great social alternative to falling asleep in front of the TV or tapping away on your iPad - now available to play at Ipswich County Library as part of the new Board Games Library.
