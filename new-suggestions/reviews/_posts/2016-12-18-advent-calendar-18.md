This is a thrilling, charming little story and one that stays in the mind. The main character, Maud ,is an elderly lady with signs of dementia and this book is very cleverly written. It gives a clear sense of the person behind the illness and how they perceive the world around them. We follow Maud in her quest to solve the fact that her friend Elizabeth is missing and her trials and tribulations along the way.
