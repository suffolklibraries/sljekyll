This enjoyable book is about a widower discovering and coming to terms with the life of his wife before he met her. It explores the process of grief and friendship through a very likeable main character.

Although fanciful and somewhat sentimental, this charming book is written with humour and some depths of insight. It stimulated a surprising amount of discussion due to the wide range of locations and situations it features.

A charming and gentle story, this makes a good holiday book with the read-on factor.
