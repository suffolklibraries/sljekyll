Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Lakenheath Library manager Chris Howard recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1673013"><cite>The Last of the Spirits</cite></a>, by Chris Priestley.

<cite>The Times</cite> proclaimed Cambridge author Chris Priestley as a "modern master of suspense" for his ghoulish and often grisly ghost stories for the Young Adult market, and the <cite>Tales of Terror</cite> scribe certainly doesn’t disappoint with this imaginative spin on Charles Dickens' most famous festive frightener.

Released a couple of years ago, 2016 will be the third Christmas in succession I have returned to <cite>The Last of the Spirits</cite> for a seasonal shot of snow, spooks, Scrooge and Victorian scruples – and the first I will be giving it as a gift to those who appreciate a fresh perspective on an endearing and classic yuletide yarn.
