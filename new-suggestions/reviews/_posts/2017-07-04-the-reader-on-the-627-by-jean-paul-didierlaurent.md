> "Guylain Vignolles lives on the edge of existence. Working at a book pulping factory in a job he hates, he has but one pleasure in life. Sitting on the 6.27 train each day, Guylain recites aloud from pages he has saved from the jaws of his monstrous pulping machine. And it's this release of words into the world that starts our hero on a journey that will finally bring meaning into his life. For one morning, Guylain discovers the diary of a lonely young woman: Julie. A woman who feels as lost in the world as he does. As he reads from these pages to a rapt audience, Guylain finds himself falling hopelessly in love with their enchanting author."

This book went down very well with us. It was just the right length and featured amazing and loveable characters and typical French humour.

The only criticisms we had were that the story was so fantastical as to be unbelieveable, and some of the original puns may have sadly been lost in translation.

Overall, <cite>The Reader on the 6.27</cite> is a larger-than-life, unique, original and absolutely delightful story.
