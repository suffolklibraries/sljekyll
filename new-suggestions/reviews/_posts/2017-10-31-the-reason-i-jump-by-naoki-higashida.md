**[See <cite>The Reason I Jump</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1550932)**

Written by Naoki Higashida when he was 13 years old, this fascinating book beautifully describes an insight into the behaviour of autistic children.

Higashida explains things like what causes him to have panic attacks, why he repeats the same questions and why he likes to jump. He gives the reader a chance to enter the mind of another and see the world from a different perspective.

<cite>The Reason I Jump</cite> is the most important book I have read this year. I would highly recommend it to anyone, particularly anyone one living or working with autism. It really makes you think.
