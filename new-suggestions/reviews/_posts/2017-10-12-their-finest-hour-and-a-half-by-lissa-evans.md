I need to start this review by saying I apologise unreservedly to Lissa Evans. An odd start to a book review, I’ll admit, but over the past few years, I’ve committed that age-old offence of judging a book by its cover and therefore decided that her books weren’t for me. How wrong I have been and I can only say how sorry I am.

I came to this book via the brilliant film adaptation, [<cite>Their Finest</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2201811), and I loved the book just as much, if not a little bit more. During World War II, Catrin Cole is drafted into the Ministry of Information to write “the slop” (women’s dialogue) in propaganda films. Hopelessly out of her depth, patronised and belittled by the men from the Ministry and the world of film, she soon finds her feet and her voice.

This was a brilliant book, well researched, I learnt so much about film making and cinema during World War II. It is funny, moving, romantic and uplifting but it doesn’t shy away from tragedy, be it in the bombing raids on London or accidents that occur. I loved it and I’ll be seeking out other Lissa Evans titles.
