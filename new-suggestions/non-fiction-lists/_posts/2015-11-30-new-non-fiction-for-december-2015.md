      If you remember the 1991 film <cite>Not without my daughter</cite> starring Sally Field, you will be interested in what happened next. Now the daughter tells the whole story, not only of her imprisonment and escape but of life after fleeing Iran: living in fear of re-abduction, battling recurring nightmares and panic attacks, taking on an assumed name, surviving life-threatening illness — all under the menacing shadow of her father. This is the story of an extraordinary young woman&#8217;s triumph over life-crushing trauma to build a life of peace and forgiveness.
