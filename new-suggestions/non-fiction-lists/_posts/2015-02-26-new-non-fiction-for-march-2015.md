      In June 2013 Sean Conway set out from Land&#8217;s End in his bid to be the first person to swim the length of Britain. It was a challenge so extreme that most of the sponsors Sean approached turned him down as they were worried that he would die trying.

      In 1938, with the Japanese army approaching from Nanking, Huan Hsu&#8217;s great-great grandfather, Liu, and his five granddaughters were forced to flee their hometown on the banks of the Yangtze River. But before they left, a hole was dug deep, in which was stowed the family heirlooms. Huan Hsu&#8217;s fascinating record of his family history combines with accounts of great change in China, and perhaps reveals the secret hiding place of his grandfather&#8217;s porcelain.
