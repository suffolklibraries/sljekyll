      Nick Frost&#8217;s family life was difficult, blighted by alcoholism, illness and sudden misfortune meaning they lost everything overnight. He left school early and drifted from job to job dogged by his own personal demons. It&#8217;s something of a miracle that Nick survived and even more that he would achieve such success with his writing, acting and comedy.
