![B. A. Paris](/images/featured/featured-b-a-paris.jpg)

B. A. Paris grew up in England and lived in France for most of her adult life before returning to the UK. She has previously worked as a trader with an international bank and a language school teacher. Her bestselling novels, which include [<cite>Behind Closed Doors</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1893896) and [<cite>The Breakdown</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080745), have sold in 37 territories around the world.

Paris' latest book, [<cite>The Dilemma</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2670938), is published by HQ, HarperCollins and is available to reserve from the library, or to buy as a paperback, eBook or audiobook.

## 1. Who were your literary heroes and influences growing up?

In order of my age – Enid Blyton, C. S. Lewis and Agatha Christie.

## 2.  Your new book <cite>The Dilemma</cite> is out this month. Can you give us a flavour of what to expect?

<a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2670938"><img src="/images/featured/featured-the-dilemma.jpg" alt="The Dilemma" class="mw-40 {% include /c/img-float-right.html %}" /></a>

It’s a family drama centred around secrets and lies and asks the question – ‘How far would you go to give someone you love a last few hours of happiness?’

## 3. Your books tend to be an emotional rollercoaster ride for the reader. Do you plot them in advance or allow them to unfold?

I’m not a plotter. I know the beginning and the end that I want to get to. The part in-between remains a mystery until I start writing.

## 4. How much research do you do for your books?

It depends on the book and what I need to know. Sometimes the only thing I need is my imagination. But if I do need to do some research, the internet makes everything easy.

## 5. What is your writing routine?

I love to start writing as soon as I wake up and will begin by editing what I wrote the day before. In an ideal world, I’d write all day, every day. I don’t even like stopping to eat!

## 6. Can you tell us anything about your latest project?

I’ve just finished a first draft of Book Five. It’s a psychological thriller set around a murder that happened some years before.

## 7. What was the last book you read that you would pass on as a recommendation?

[<cite>Mr Nobody</cite>, by Catherine Steadman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2677363). It’s a dark and twisty psychological thriller and so well-written that it’s a delight to read.

## 8. Do you have a message for your Suffolk library readers?

I’m grateful to everyone who reads my books – thank you so much! - and borrowing them from libraries is the best way to keep one of our great institutions alive. I have so many happy memories of the travelling library that used to park near our house when I was young.

## 9. Can you share one thing about yourself that your readers may not know?

I started writing when I was fifty years old and it look me another seven to get published. If you really want to do something, it’s never too late.
