![Andy Weir](/images/featured/featured-andy-weir.jpg)

Andy Weir is an American novelist whose debut novel, [<cite>The Martian</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1641851), became a word-of-mouth hit. Initially self-published, it sold five million copies and was made into a blockbuster film by Ridley Scott.  

His second and latest novel, [<cite>Artemis</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2267665), was published in 2017. Set in the late 2080s, it follows the life of porter and smuggler Jasmine "Jazz" Bashara as she gets caught up in a conspiracy for control of Artemis, the first and only city on the moon.

## 1. Who were your literary influences as you were growing up?

Mainly Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke. I grew up reading my dad's sci-fi collection, so I'm a generation off on which books influenced me.

## 2. How did Mark Watney in <cite>The Martian</cite> take shape in your mind? When did you find his ‘voice’?

Mark is based on my own personality. Though he’s smarter and braver than I am and he doesn’t have my flaws. I guess he’s what I wish I were like.

## 3. What is your writing routine? You created a whole city on the moon in <cite>Artemis</cite>. Was this in your head or did you have a wall or floor full of information?

Tons of research. I love worldbuilding. That part is fun for me. Especially when there's a bunch of physics involved. So making a moon city was a real treat :)

And yes, I had a wall full of information.

## 4. Is there anything you can tell us about your latest ‘work in progress’?

Nothing firm, yet. I'm still pitching ideas to my editor.

## 5. How do we get more regular readers to take a chance on reading sci-fi?

I think a good start would be for sci-fi authors to make things other than dystopian, fascist misery worlds. There's a place for that, sure, but right now the sci-fi shelves are littered with that and the concept has completely saturated the whole genre.

I think we need more old-school sci-fi, where it was a hopeful, awesome future. One you'd want to live in.

## 6. What is on your ‘to read’ list at the moment?

Lately I haven't had time to read anything :(

## 7. Can you tell us one thing that your readers may not know about you?

I love woodworking and mixing cocktails. Though not at the same time.
