![Danya Kukafka](/images/featured/featured-danya-kukafka.jpg)

Danya Kukafka is an American writer and a graduate of New York University’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Her first novel, [<cite>Girl in Snow</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2309671), was recently a Radio 2 Book Club choice.

## 1. Who were your literary influences as you were growing up?

The most influential book for me as a child was [<cite>Harry Potter and the Philsopher’s Stone</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2165228) — then, of course, the rest of the series following.

I read these books at such a crucial age, and they taught me the direct power of world-building. J.K. Rowling was the first writer to show me that it’s possible to completely fall into a universe of someone else’s creation.

## 2. Your new novel is <cite>Girl in Snow</cite>. How did it take shape and what was it like ‘living’ with your characters during that period?

<cite>Girl in Snow</cite> began with just one character, and ended with three.

Cameron’s character came to me first, as I was thinking about the question: can you have a main character who truly does not know if he’s done something terrible? Can you ask a reader to love him anyway? The whole story unfolded from there, and I actually wrote a full draft just from Cameron’s perspective.

Jade came much later, when I realized something was missing, and Russ came after I thought the book was “finished.” Living with these characters was such a joy. I miss them often.

## 3. <cite>Girl in Snow</cite> is unusual as it is a murder mystery but solving the murder is almost incidental. Was it a conscious decision to play with some of the elements of the regular crime/thriller genre?

Yes, this was a very deliberate choice. By framing it within the context of a murder mystery, it helped me structure the story, but as I got further into the book, I found that I was much more interested in the characters on the periphery of the story than I was in the murder mystery itself.

Also, I wanted to give readers something new to chew on, and I wanted to talk about the trope of the “beautiful dead girl.” By focusing the story away from Lucinda, I was aiming to give her some privacy, and also to talk about how often these dead girls in media become spaces on which people, particularly men, project themselves.

## 4. Is there anything you can share about your latest 'work in progress'?

I’m working on another novel! I couldn’t tell you what it’s about — mostly because I still don’t quite know myself — but I know it will be similarly dark, and will also deal with young lives in a small community.

## 5. Do you have a message for your readers in Suffolk Libraries?

Libraries were a haven for me as a child, and some of my best memories growing up took place at my local library. I’m so grateful to every reader of <cite>Girl In Snow</cite>, and to the wonderful librarians who make it all possible.

## 6. What is on your 'to read' list at the moment?

I’m very excited to pick up a copy of <cite>The Recovering</cite>, Leslie Jamison's newest.

## 7. Can you tell us one thing that your readers may not know about you?

I really love pickles! I’ve started making them myself, and have found incredible joy in it. Watch out for a forthcoming pickle empire.
