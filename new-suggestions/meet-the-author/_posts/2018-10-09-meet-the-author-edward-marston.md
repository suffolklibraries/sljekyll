Edward Marston is the author of sixty crime novels, set in seven distinct periods of history. His books have been translated into many languages. His first historical mystery, [<cite>The Queen's Head</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=63221), was published in 1988, launching the Nicholas Bracewell series. Edward's latest book, [<cite>Points of Danger</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2440789), is part of his Railway Detective series.

## 1. Who were your literary influences and heroes as you were growing up?

Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson were early influences but, as a teenager, my favourite authors were Bernard Shaw and P. G. Wodehouse, two masters of the English language who were still turning out quality work in their nineties.

## 2. How did Nicholas Bracewell come about and when did you realise he was a character you could develop?

I was always fascinated by Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Plays of that period attracted every element in society, from members of the aristocracy to lowly apprentices. In Nicholas Bracewell, I had a hero who was harrying the actors one minute then conversing with Lord Westfield, their patron, the next.

As book holder in a theatre company, Nicholas has a pivotal role. From the start I thought of him as a man with the stamina and resourcefulness to hold a series of novels together.

## 3. <cite>Points of Danger</cite>, is set in East Anglia in 1861. What was it like to write and did it involve a lot of research?

<cite>Points of Danger</cite> was fun to write but did involve a lot of research. In 1861 there were several rival railway companies in East Anglia and a desperate need for someone to unify them and improve their woeful record. What would happen, I wondered, if the man most likely to bring together the various companies was murdered?

I come from a railway family and have always loved steam locomotives. For our wedding anniversary, my wife and I once had a day at Didcot, taking it in turns to drive a locomotive that was built in 1916 but was still in excellent condition.

## 4. When you read a mystery story by another writer, can you enjoy it as a reader or are you always thinking ‘I can see what you have done there’?

I judge every crime novel on its own merits and never try to guess what the author is up to. There's great pleasure in being caught up in a thrilling narrative.

## 5. You have written over 100 books now, including non-fiction. Where is the best place for a new reader to start with your work?

The first book in the Nicholas Bracewell series (<cite>The Queen's Head</cite>) and the first in the Colbeck series ([<cite>The Railway Detective</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=65941)).

## 6. Do you have a message for your many readers in Suffolk Libraries?

Fight hard to save your library. It's a vital public asset.

## 7. Can you tell us one thing your readers may not know about you?

I acted in the Turkish premiere of Harold Pinter's play, <cite>The Caretaker</cite>, in Istanbul.
