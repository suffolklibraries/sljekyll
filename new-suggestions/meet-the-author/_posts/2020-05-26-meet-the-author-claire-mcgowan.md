![Claire McGowan](/images/featured/featured-claire-mcgowan.jpg)

Claire McGowan was born in Northern Ireland. Her first novel <cite>The Fall</cite> was published in 2012. Claire's series of novels about forensic psychologist Paula Maguire will be familiar to many Suffolk readers. Claire's latest book is <cite>The Other Wife</cite>.

## 1. Who were your literary heroes as you were growing up and when did you first realise you wanted to write?

I always wanted to be a writer - I started into Agatha Christie quite early, about nine or so, and not long after that Stephen King (though I'm not sure why I was allowed to read this when my mother was very strict about TV!)

## 2.	Many Suffolk readers will be aware of your books about forensic psychologist Paula Maguire. Where did the inspiration for Paula come from and did your relationship with her as a character change as the series progressed?

I couldn't say where she came from - one of those nice experiences where the book just unfolds with ease. I loved seeing how she changed a lot throughout the series, making mistakes but also growing up a bit.

## 3. The Other Wife is your latest title. Can you tell us a little about it?

It's about three women who seem like strangers but as you find out, are intricately connected. The main character, Suzi, is pregnant and stuck in an isolated cottage with her controlling husband, and has done something she's terribly guilty about.

## 4. How do you balance your work as a lecturer with your literary career?

I actually don't lecture any more - just writing full-time now.   

## 5. Some of your readers will not be aware that you have also written romantic fiction as Eva Woods. How do you step between the two genres?

I don't find this difficult as I read lots of different things, so it seems natural to write them too. However I do often make the romance too plotty and have to take things out!

## 6. I remember watching one of your pieces online where you said you do not usually say much about what you are working on before it is out there but I'll ask it anyway. Is there anything you can share with us about your latest project?

I can as it's actually finished - the new book is called <cite>The Push</cite> and is about a murder in an ante-natal group. It's sort of a British <cite>Big Little Lies</cite> and will be out later this year.

## 7. Has a book ever changed your life or made you look at things differently?

I like to read non-fiction too and found Gloria Steinem's book, <cite>Revolution From Within</cite>, really changed how I thought about the world.

## 8. What is on your 'to read' pile at the moment?

So many things! My kindle is also groaning. I want to give the [<cite>Northern Lights</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/2110783) books a proper go soon.

## 9. Do you have a message for your Suffolk readers?

Thank you for reading and if you ever want to drop me a line I'll be sure to reply!

## 10. Can you tell us one thing your readers may not know about you?

I have lived overseas three times in my life - China, France, and America.
