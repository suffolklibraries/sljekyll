Katie Fforde is a British romantic novelist. Her first novel, [<cite>Living Dangerously</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=224280), was chosen as part of the WHSmith Fresh Talent promotion and she has published more than 18 novels since then. She has sold over 3 million books, and her work has been translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish and Swedish.

Her latest novel, [<cite>A Secret Garden</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2094631), was published in February and is still circulating very well in our libraries. Her 2016 novel [<cite>A Summer at Sea</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1897782) was recently chosen for our Suffolk Loves collection and is widely available.

## 1. Who were your literary influences as you were growing up?

I think Georgette Heyer has been my biggest literary influence. I started reading her books when I was quite young. I was a bit surprised when a reader spotted the influence after my first book but I have read them all so often I thought she was probably right.

## 2. I have heard that you take your research very seriously. Did you really go on a Ray Mears survival course to research a book?

I do take research very seriously. I like to get my hands in the clay - something I learnt from the potter friend who was helping me with my first book. Instead of having me taking notes in the corner while she threw a pot, she made me sit at the wheel and try. I realised then without that literally hands-on approach, it wouldn’t have worked so well. And yes, I certainly did go on a Ray Mears course. It was enormously good fun.

## 3. What are the essential ingredients of a feel-good romantic novel?

The essential elements of a good romantic novel are believable characters we can relate to, like and find attractive, a strong plot which is more than just the love story, a good, strongly portrayed setting and good secondary characters.

## 4. Is there anything you can tell us about your latest project?

My latest project is about farming and cheese. I love both (although am not actually a farmer.)

## 5. Do you have a message for your many readers in Suffolk Libraries?

I value my library readers even more than those who buy the books. They have to make a real effort to get the books and so I’m grateful that in the midst of so much choice, they choose my books (sometimes!).

## 6. Can you tell us one thing that your readers might not know about you?

Readers might not know that I am incredibly untidy, but they may have picked that up from my characters.

## 7. If you hadn’t become a writer what would you have liked to do?

I think if I hadn’t been a writer I would have been a counsellor or some job where I get to listen to people’s stories. I love doing that.
