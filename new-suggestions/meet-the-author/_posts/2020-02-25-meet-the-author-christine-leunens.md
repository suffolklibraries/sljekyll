![Christine Leunens](/images/featured/featured-christine-leunens.jpg)

Christine Leunens is a New Zealand-Belgian novelist. She is the author of [<cite>Primordial Soup</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2733274), [<cite>Caging Skies</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2656083), and <cite>A Can of Sunshine</cite>, which have been translated into over twenty languages. <cite>Caging Skies</cite> was the inspiration for the award-winning film <cite>Jojo Rabbit</cite>.

## 1. Who were your literary heroes and influences as you were growing up?

Lewis Carroll’s Alice, Jules Verne’s Lidenbrock, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Herman Melville’s Ishmael, then I remember when I came upon the book [<cite>The Stranger</cite>, by Albert Camus](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=315838), when I was around twelve years old and how the opening words shocked me, but the cynical tone of the anti-hero Meursault also stayed with me and propelled me into the even stranger world of adult literature.

## 2. What was your path to becoming a writer? Was writing something you always wanted to do?

I believe I was always destined to be one, having been excessively bookish from an early age. My mother kept saying, “Why don’t you go out and play instead of ruining your eyes reading all day?” My grandfather, a Belgian artist, insisted that I was going to be a writer. He said he could tell from my 20-page letters to him.

Ironically, to fund my studies and first book, I worked as a print model, the diametric opposite of a writer. As I posed for magazines and fashion ads, it was as if I was mute. All I could express was a limited range of emotions with merely my face, the main attention on my physical appearance. From there, it was such a relief not to be seen at all, to be almost invisible, so refreshing to express complex thoughts, true feelings and who I really am through writing alone.

## 3. I didn’t realise <cite>Caging Skies</cite> was written in 2004. How is it that it still feels so relevant? Were you surprised that there was all this interest in it 16 years after you wrote it?

It wasn’t as relevant in 2004, no one ever called it that. Back then, it was a historical novel which recorded both known and less known aspects of WWII so that people would never forget what had happened.

It’s only been in the past few years that <cite>Caging Skies</cite> has been suddenly called relevant, alas, and as a response taken in country after country where racism, antisemitism and the Far Right are on the rise.

## 4. <cite>Jojo Rabbit</cite> has put you centre stage on the Hollywood red carpet. Has the experience lived up to your expectations?

When researching and writing Caging Skies for five years at the Memorial de Caen, a WW2 Museum near the Landing Beaches of Normandy, I had no idea that the story would ever be adapted for the big screen, let alone be nominated for two Golden Globes, six Baftas, six Oscars, and being awarded a Humanitas Prize. Just being driven to such ceremonies in Hollywood, everything closed off and monitored by FBI agents, homeland security, dogs, drones, helicopters, then the strip of red carpet blinded by the flash of a hundred cameras, getting a bouquet of microphones thrust my way, it all feels like being in a film. It’s exciting, a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it still feels surreal and hasn’t fully sunk in.
