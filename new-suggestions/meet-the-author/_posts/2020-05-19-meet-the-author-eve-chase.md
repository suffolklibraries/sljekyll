Eve Chase was formerly a journalist before she began writing novels with great success. <cite>Black Rabbit Hall</cite> and <cite>The Vanishing of Audrey Wilde</cite> were bestsellers.

Eve's latest book is <cite>The Glass House</cite> is due 14th May.

## 1.	Who were your literary heroes and influences growing up?

I owe an immeasurable debt to my childhood library card. Growing up, the local library was my second home and I hungrily worked my way around its shelves, discovering many favourites including Judy Blume, Virginia Andrews, Agatha Christie and Oscar Wilde.

## 2.	Black Rabbit Hall was your debut and you employed a dual time frame to tell the story. Did this require a lot of plotting beforehand?

Black Rabbit Hall, not so much. But I’ve plotted out subsequent books in more detail, partly out of panic I won’t be able to pull it off again! The Glass House, my new novel, deviated wildly from its original outline, but the feel of it - a mystery set in a forest, with a young nanny at its heart - remained the same.

## 3. Can you give Suffolk readers a flavour of your new book The Glass House?

A baby is abandoned outside a remote manor house in a forest. The family inside take her in, and an explosive secret is forged.

## 4. Reading <cite>The Glass House</cite> I was strongly aware that the forest was almost a character in its own right. Was this something you were aware of as you were writing?

As a reader, I want to be transported, so I honour that in my writing, and always try to create a tangible, immersive sense of place. The forest definitely has its own character - mysterious, intense, and unpredictable - and moods.  

## 5. Can you share anything about what you are working on at the moment?

It’s a dual-time frame book set on the north coast of Cornwall, involving warring half-sisters, an inheritance and a deep dark mystery.

## 6. What is on your ‘to read’ pile at the moment?

I’m finally about to dive into Hilary Mantel’s [<cite>The Mirror and The Light</cite>](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/4754062). I may be some time! I’m also looking forward to Kate Riordan’s <cite>The Heatwave</cite>.

## 7. Is there a book you wish you had written and why?

Mantel’s [Bring Up The Bodies](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/715965). It’s just superlatively good. I’ve never read anything like it before or since. Also Helen Fielding’s <cite>Bridget Jones’s Diary</cite> because it was so fresh, and made me hoot with laughter.

## 8. Do you have a message for your readers in Suffolk?

Writers need readers. It’s you who make it all worthwhile. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Keep reading.

## 9. Can you tell us one thing about yourself that your readers may not know?

I’m a passionate gardener. I don’t think about writing or words at all when I’m gardening, and I absolutely love it.
