![Heather Morris](/images/featured/featured-heather-morris.jpg)

Heather Morris was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia as an adult. She took a degree in Political Science, worked in the social work department at a hospital, competed as a 'Veteran' athlete in shot-put, discus, javelin and hammer throwing and wrote screenplays before turning to writing the story of her friend Lale Solokov.

This story became the bestselling [<cite>The Tattooist of Auschwits</cite>](). Her second novel, [<cite>Cilka's Journey</cite>](), based on the life of another Holocaust survivor, Cilka Klein, was published earlier this month.
