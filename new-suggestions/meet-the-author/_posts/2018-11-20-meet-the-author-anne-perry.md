Anne Perry is an English author of historical detective fiction, best known for her Thomas Pitt and William Monk series. She lives in California. Her latest book is [<cite>A Christmas Revelation</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2446880).

## 1. Who were your literary influences and heroes as you were growing up?

Mostly poets of the Great War period. Rupert Brooke, Siegfried Sassoon, James Elroy Flecker, and all of G. K. Chesterton.  Also from a little earlier, Ryder Haggard. The poets I still love.

Childhood, definitely Lewis Carroll - [<cite>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2382853), [<cite>The Hunting of the Snark</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1975792). And A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh and friends.

## 2. What is your writing routine?

Monday through Saturday all day, 9 to 5 or 6, except as ordinary chores are necessary, and eating, of course!  

I get fairly frequent breaks for travel, signings etc. October just past, for example, was unusual, I went to another place in CA for four days to a convention, then to Paris to a book fair, then to Vancouver, and last week I went very briefly to Phoenix. Now I am looking forward to a good spell at home to work.

## 3. The character of Thomas Pitt has accompanied you on your journey as a writer. How do you feel about him nearly 40 years later?

I still enjoy Thomas Pitt, but after 33 novels, I am very happy to move on ten years to feature his son, grown up, and into the new century. Thomas is alive and well, but the stories are about Daniel, who is a junior lawyer. Working on the third one now.

## 4. I read somewhere that your books have never been out of print. What do you think it is about your books that connect so well with your readers?

I am not sure why the connection with readers is so strong, but very grateful for it. It may be just because the stories move in real time? Or because the moral and social problems are current ones that still trouble us?

## 5. Is there anything you can tell us about your latest work in progress?

Working on Daniel story \#3, to follow [<cite>Twenty-One Days</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2197334) and [<cite>Triple Jeopardy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2427181).

## 6. Do you have a message for your many readers in Suffolk Libraries?

Have a great winter reading, and enjoy the glories of spring when it comes. In spring I think of England: bluebell woods, wild primroses in bloom, and hawthorn hedges with perfume to make you dizzy!

## 7. What would be your ideal day?

One where I think I have done my best!
