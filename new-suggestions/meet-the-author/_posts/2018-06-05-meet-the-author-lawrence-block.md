Lawrence Block is a legendary American crime writer best known for two long-running New York–set series about the recovering alcoholic P.I. Matthew Scudder and the gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. He was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1994 and is the author of more than 150 books under several pseudonyms.

## 1. Who were your literary influences and heroes as you were growing up?

Initially, American realists of the first half of the 20th century — James T. Farrell, John Steinbeck, Thomas Wolfe, John O'Hara.

When I began writing, I read no end of crime fiction, and especially admired Fredric Brown, Evan Hunter, Rex Stout, and, oh, too many to mention.

## 2. What is your writing routine?

I don't know that I have one. Over the years I've tended to go off somewhere — a writers' colony, a rented apartment — and focus entirely on the writing. I've also written much of my work at home. Nowadays I write little, and infrequently.

## 3. Where did the character of Matt Scudder come from and what made you decide to keep revisiting him over the years?

An agent suggested I develop a series featuring a tough NYC cop. It didn't take me long to realize that I'm more comfortable with an outsider's perspective, so I made him an ex-cop.

I've been able to stay so long with Scudder (and have in fact just completed a new novella, <cite>A Time to Scatter Stones</cite>, 40+ years after his debut in [<cite>The Sins of the Fathers</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=255982)) because I've allowed him to change and grow over time. Typically, fictional detectives never changed much, and rarely aged, but I saw early on that the level of realism in the books demanded that Scudder be altered as a result of the experiences he undergoes.

I also elected to have the man age in real time. That's worked out well for the character — but I've followed his example and aged in real time myself, and that is something I really do not recommend.

## 4. If you could re-write anyone else’s book in your own style which would you choose?

Not something to which I've ever aspired, but it's an interesting question. Perhaps the Book of Job.

## 5. If someone read this and thought ‘I’d like to read some of his books’, where would be a good starting point for the new reader?

Probably the first volumes of each of my three major series: [<cite>The Sins of the Fathers</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=255982) (Matthew Scudder), [<cite>Burglars Can't be Choosers</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2446177) (Bernie Rhodenbarr), [<cite>Hit Man</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=254942) (Keller).

## 6. Do you have a message for your many readers in Suffolk Libraries?

Only that I hope you continue to enjoy them. I could add something saccharine about how important each and every one of you is to me, and how the writer is nothing without the reader, and — oh, that's all rot, isn't it? I'm having a good time, and hope you are as well.

## 7. Can you tell us one thing that your readers might not know about you?

My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.
