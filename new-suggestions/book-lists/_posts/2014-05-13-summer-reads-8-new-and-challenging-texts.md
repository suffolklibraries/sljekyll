      Tsukiko is in her late thirties and living alone when one night she happens to meet one of her former high school teachers, Sensei, in a bar. After their initial encounter, the pair continue to meet occasionally to share food and drink sake and come to develop a hesitant intimacy which tilts awkwardly into love.

      A vivid, funny and moving first collection of poems by a critically acclaimed contributor to <cite>New Poetries V</cite>. Letford’s wry humour and carefully constructed poems make this an absolute must for both newcomers and regular readers of poetry. His work as a manual labourer gives his poems a welcoming, grounded feel, yet the writing is wildly emotive and playful. Page after page, Letford’s beguiling voice takes you through a collection of gems. This poetry collection has that rare quality; it’s a page turner. <a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/CA4B0982-5502-4A44-AAF7-F06914218AA5/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=A55FC34C-CB82-400B-913C-7A3B9F85785C">Available from our Overdrive service</a>.

      Set in a rural landscape in 1831, Leyshon introduces us to Mary, a quick–witted, straight–talking farm girl who has a story to tell. By no means will she find it easy, but her sharp voice and stripped back prose will leave you gripped from beginning to end. Best served in one exhilarating sitting, this brutal story demands that you take Mary’s hand and follow her all the way to its brutal conclusion.

      Detectives Hawthorn and Child take us through a series of vignettes where no promises over narrative can be made. Characters and events slip and slide between the pages, but are held up by strong, compelling prose. This book demands your involvement – are you ready to pick up the pieces? Unnerving scenes of real, confused London life, the lives of functioning–but–marginal Londoners revealed in all their vulnerabilities and misapprehensions. Brilliantly observed.

    <p>
      With tragicomic bravado and psychological insight, <cite>Raptors</cite>, like a novel, tells the turbulent story of a father and his family. A very accessible collection about the ups and downs of a family held hostage by the looming moods of ‘Father’. The language of Raptors is deceptively childlike, in stark contrast to the relationships it describes, the ‘rusty, conniving father / who creaks, crunches and opens’. But there are no simple rights and wrongs in this world where ‘terrible moonlight’ tenderly illuminates a family pulling itself apart. <a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/76802395-C55A-47B4-AB2E-5932D709C252/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=9EFBA9D5-4926-4837-B127-9C545794B27D">Available from our Overdrive service</a>.

      A triptych capturing the ordinary life of Neville Lister during South Africa&#8217;s extraordinary revolution. Vladislavic lays moments side by side like photographs on a table. He lucidly portrays a city and its many lives through reflections on memory, art and what we should really be seeking. <a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/76802395-C55A-47B4-AB2E-5932D709C252/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=14FFF4B0-1CBD-49CC-8C06-0A068A2B1893">Available from our Overdrive service</a>.

      Jake Whyte is running from something. But what? Living alone on a British island, her only companion is Dog, who helps her tend her sheep. Dog’s whimpering and scared though; something is coming. Something that’s picking off the sheep one by one, creeping through the evening as a stranger lurks by the trees over the field… Flashing through it all there’s Jake’s former life in the heat and rough of Australian sheep farms, the life she ran away from overseas.
