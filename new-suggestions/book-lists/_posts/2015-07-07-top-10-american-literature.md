      This is a stream of conciousness novel which chronicles the decline of the American South through the experiences of Benjy Compson, who struggles to articulate his vision of life. The four parts of the novel relate many of the same episodes, each from a different point of view and therefore with emphasis on different themes and events. A challenging read.

      A 16-year-old American boy relates in his own words the experiences he goes through at school and after, and reveals with unusual candour the workings of his own mind. It is ironic that a book that connected with so many people was written by a man who became a recluse.

      Hemingway&#8217;s classic portrayal of the Spanish Civil War, seen through the eyes of an American fighting on the Republican side, captures the excitement and danger of war in a way few other works of fiction have been unable to do.
