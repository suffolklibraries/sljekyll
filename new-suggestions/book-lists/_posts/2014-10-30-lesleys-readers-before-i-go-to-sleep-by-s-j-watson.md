I read this book before I went to the cinema to see it and I would suggest that you carefully consider which you want to do first, as there is a big twist that may spoil the enjoyment of one or the other for you!

The main character of Christine is well written and you really feel her pain at not being able to remember the day before, when she wakes up. There is a slow build up as Christine starts to keep a diary and we gradually gain a more and more complete picture of what is going on. It is an extremely tense read and never resorts to becoming some boring Groundhog Day of a book. It makes this book a real page turner.

I enjoyed this book and would absolutely recommend it. As the reader approaches the end of the book, the tension is racked up so much that the narrative really does engross the reader and… well… to see if the ending is worth it, order the book now!

## Lesley Dolphins&#8217; review:

Of all the books we’ve read for Lesley’s Readers, this has been the one that’s made me skip the chores to keep turning the pages. I’m afraid I’m not someone who analyses books too much — as long as I enjoy them I read them. I definitely enjoyed this!

It’s a fascinating and horrifying thought that someone could forget all that’s happened to them every time they go to sleep and a brilliant theme for a story. Apparently this first time novel was written by an NHS audiologist in between shifts — I wonder if he’d met a patient with this condition?

I knew there had to be a twist at the end but didn’t see this one coming!
