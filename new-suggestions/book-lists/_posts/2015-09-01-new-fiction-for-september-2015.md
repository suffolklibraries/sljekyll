      Probably the most eagerly awaited fiction title in Suffolk! Jack Reacher arrives at a remote railroad stop and discovers a woman waiting for a missing private investigator, a cryptic note about 200 deaths, and a small town full of silent, watchful people. His one-day stopover looks like it is about to turn into something more complicated.

      Young Pip Tyler doesn&#8217;t know who she is. She knows that her real name is Purity, that she has $130,000 in student debt, that she&#8217;s squatting with anarchists in Oakland and that her relationship with her mother &#8211; her only family &#8211; is hazardous. But she doesn&#8217;t have a clue who her father is, why her mother has always concealed her own real name, or how she can ever have a normal life. An encounter with a German peace activist leads Pip to South America and The Sunlight Project, an organisation that traffics in all the secrets of the world &#8211; including, Pip hopes, the secret of her origins.

      East African Coast, 1670. The Golden Bough, captained by Henry &#8216;Hal&#8217; Courtney, is running south from Ethiopia to Zanzibar. Below deck, both his crew and his lover, the fearless warrior Judith Nazet, sleep. As the moon glints through clouds, Hal sights a ship passing close by. Although there is an uneasy truce between the warring English and Dutch, Hal scents danger. When the Bough is boarded, the crew must fight to defend their ship and their lives. But soon Hal will face even graver danger, as he discovers his mortal enemy still lives and is hell-bent on revenge.

      Lynda La Plante goes back in time to 1972 to introduce us to a young Jane Tennison, memorably portrayed by Helen Mirren in Prime Suspect as she leaves the Metropolitan Police Training Academy to be placed on probationary exercise in Hackney where criminality thrives. We witness her struggle to cope in a male-dominated, chauvinistic environment, learning fast to deal with shocking situations with no help or sympathy from her superiors. Then comes her involvement in her first murder case.
