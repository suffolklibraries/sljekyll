      It&#8217;s December in Boston, and Spenser is busy planning the menu for Christmas dinner when he&#8217;s confronted in his office by a young boy named Slide. Homeless and alone, Slide has found refuge with an organisation named Street Business, which gives shelter and seeks job opportunities for the homeless and lost. Spenser, aided by Hawk, finds a trail that leads to a dangerous drug kingpin, whose hold on the at-risk community Street Business serves threatens not just the boys&#8217; safety and security, but their lives as well. Unfinished at the time of his death, <cite>Silent Night</cite> was completed by Parker&#8217;s longtime agent, whose decades-long association with Parker&#8217;s work gives her unique insight and perspective to his voice and storytelling style.

      Growing up in the west of Ireland in the 1940s Tess is a shy introverted child. Beneath her quiet exterior lies a heart of fire that that will drive her to make her home among the hurly burly of 1960s New York. Over four decades and a life lived with quiet intensity on Academy Street in upper Manhattan, Tess encounters ferocious love and calamitous loss. Joyous and heart-breaking, restrained but sweeping, this is a profoundly moving story that charts one woman&#8217;s quest for belonging amid the dazzle and tumult of America&#8217;s greatest city.
