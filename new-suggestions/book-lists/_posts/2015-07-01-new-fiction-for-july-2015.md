      The biggest literary event of the year bar none. Harper Lee returns with her first book for 55 years. Scout (Jean Louise Finch) has returned to Maycomb from New York to visit her father Atticus. She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand both her father&#8217;s attitude toward society and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood.

      In 1883, Thaniel Steepleton returns to his flat to find the lock picked and a gold pocket watch on his pillow. He is a telegraphist at the Home Office, which has just received a threat for what could be the largest-scale Fenian bombing in history. When the watch saves Thaniel&#8217;s life in a blast that destroys Scotland Yard, he goes in search of its maker, Keita Mori &#8211; a kind, lonely immigrant who sweeps him into a new world of clockwork and music. Although Mori seems harmless at first, it is soon clear that Thaniel is out of his depth.
