> "Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow. Two centuries ago, in the small, isolated town, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town. Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return from the depths, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them down to their watery deaths.

> "Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters' return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into or the fact that his arrival will change everything."

<cite>The Wicked Deep</cite> is perfect for anyone looking to read something thatâ€™s a little different from your standard YA fantasy fare. Every character is unlikeable in some way and I absolutely adored the twisty nature of the book, especially the final sting in the tale.

Ernshaw has created a dark, eerie and atmospheric tale that is very visually stimulating. I can easily see this as a hit TV series. If you loved [<cite>We Were Liars</cite>, by E. Lockhart](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1615611), you certainly won't be disappointed by this book.
