> "Pisa, 1299. In the male-dominated world of Renaissance Italy, Netta is an ambitious young woman and the last in the line of a great family of sculptors and stone-carvers. Determined to throw off the shackles of marriage, Netta sets out to take up her family's legacy and work on fixing the city's leaning tower."

Netta is an engaging main character and <cite>Tilt</cite> is an enjoyable and quick read. I learned a lot about stonemasonry, architecture and the weathering of marble before using it in construction. As part of Barrington Stoke's range, it is suitable for a wide audience including readers with dyslexia and Irlen Syndrome.
