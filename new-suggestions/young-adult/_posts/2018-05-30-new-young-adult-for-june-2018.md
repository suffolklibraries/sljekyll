> "Taran and her twin Hari never wanted to move to Firestone House. But when the rent was doubled overnight and Dad's chemo meant he couldn't work, they had to make this tower block their home. It's good now though; they feel part of something here.

> "When they start noticing boarded-up flats and glossy fliers for expensive apartments, they don't think much of it - until Hari is caught up in a tragedy, and they are forced to go on the run. It's up to the teenagers to uncover the sinister truth behind what's going on in the block, before it blows their world apart."

Publisher Hachette describes this as "an adrenaline-fuelled, powerful YA novel about young people taking charge of their own destiny. A novel about standing up and being counted."
