> "Leave it to the heroes to save the world - villains just want to rule the world. In this unique anthology, 13 acclaimed, bestselling authors team up with 13 influential BookTubers to reimagine fairy tales from the oft-misunderstood villains' points of view."

I loved this anthology, as I’ve always been fascinated with villains, wanting to know their side of the story. Finally, a book has arrived that delivers that and more. Some of the stories are based on classic myths and books, but some are entirely new creations. All of them are fantastic, thought-provoking and have unforgettable characters.

Though all the stories were captivating, there were a few that stood out for me: <cite>Sea Witch</cite> by Marissa Meyer, <cite>Beautiful Venom</cite> by Cindy Pom, <cite>Sera</cite> by Nicola Yoon and <cite>You, You, It’s All About You</cite> by Adam Silvera. These just took my breath away with phenomenal characterisation, intricate stories and some shocking twists.

I loved the blend of popular and up-and-coming authors, and now have a lot of new books to read I might not otherwise have known about. The mix of genres was really interesting and lets readers try types of story that they might not usually read.

<cite>Because You Love To Hate Me</cite> is an engaging, unique YA anthology that is packed full of suspense, twists and betrayal. Just be warned that after you’ve read this book, you will never see some of your favourite fairytales in the same way again.
