> "Bennett's Bookshop has always been a haven for sixteen-year-old Paige Turner. It's a place where she can escape from her sleepy hometown, hang out with her best friend, Holly, and also earn some money.

> "But, like so many bookshops, Bennett's has become a 'casualty of the high street' - it's strapped for cash and going to be torn down. Paige is determined to save it but mobilising a small town like Greysworth is no mean feat. Time is ticking - but that's not the only problem Paige has. How is she going to fend off the attractions of beautiful fellow artist, Blaine? And, more importantly, will his anarchist ways make or break her bookshop campaign?"

I'm going to be honest - the only reason I was drawn to <cite>Bookshop Girl</cite> was because of the title. A YA read about a bookshop? Erm yes please! And the more I looked into this book, the more I knew I wanted to read it. So here we are...

This was a short, sweet story all about town spirit and fighting for what you believe in and I loved that. The way everyone rallied around to save the bookshop was so heart-warming and brought a big smile to my face. As someone who lives in a town where bookshops are on the decline (there are only two major bookshop chains and no independent bookshops in the town centre) it really did resonate with me on a personal level. Bookshops are amazing and need to stay as a staple on our high streets.

Paige was such a smart, bubbly character and I loved her determination and fight. She was quite comedic and reminded me of what I was like when I was a teenager. I laughed out load at few things that happened to her. Her unbreakable friendship with Holly was also a joy to read - yes, they had a few bickers, but in the end they came back together and that is what true friendship is all about.

<cite>Bookshop Girl</cite> is a really enjoyable, short read that had me smiling, laughing and reminiscing. And I cannot wait to read the next book featuring Paige and her adventures.
