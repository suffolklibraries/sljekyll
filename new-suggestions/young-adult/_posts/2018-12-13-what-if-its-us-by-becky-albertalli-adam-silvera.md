> "Meet Ben and Arthur. Ben is a battered dreamer who's shipping his ex-boyfriend's things back to him. Arthur is new to New York and struggling to fit in. After an memorable meet-cute in a New York post office, the boys lose touch only be be brought back together via a 'missed connection' advert. Is it fate? It looks like it. But after a series of disastrous first dates, Ben and Arthur may have to accept the universe should've minded its own business."

<cite>What If It's Us</cite> is an adorable LGBT+ romance about missed connections, friendship, college and Broadway. This is such a great one to pick up when you're in the mood for an easy read. With a whole host of fun characters and a really interesting premise, you're in for a treat.

This is the perfect book for someone looking for a really lighthearted read. While Albertalli and Silvera's individual novels tend to be heavily emotionally charged or deal with some tougher issues, this is a super cosy and quick book that I read in two sittings.
