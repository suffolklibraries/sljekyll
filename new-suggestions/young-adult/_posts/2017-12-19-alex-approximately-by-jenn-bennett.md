> "Bailey 'Mink' Rydell has met the boy of her dreams. They share a love of films and talk all day - Alex is perfect. Well, apart from the fact that they've never actually met - and neither of them knows the other's real name. When Bailey moves to sunny California to live with her dad, who happens to live in the same town as Alex, she decides to track him down.

> "But finding someone based on online conversations alone proves harder than Bailey thought, and with her irritating but charismatic colleague Porter Roth distracting her at every turn, will she ever get to meet the mysterious Alex?"

One of my favourite things about <cite>Alex, Approximately</cite> is how we get to see several things unfold: Bailey's rekindled relationship with her father, her friendship with her new best friend, Grace, and her summer-long efforts to figure out who 'Alex' is, which don't always go her way. While you develop your own suspicions while reading it, I personally did not expect many of the plot twists.

The only downside of the book is that some of the characters were hard to keep track of because Bailey meets so many people.

By following the changes in a teenage girl's life over a whole summer, <cite>Alex, Approximately</cite> really connects with and appeals to its audience.
