> "A princess, a traitor, a soldier, a hunter and a thief. Five teenagers with the fate of the world in their hands. Five nations destined for conflict.

> "In Brigant, Princess Catherine prepares for a political marriage arranged by her brutal and ambitious father, while her true love, Ambrose, faces the executioner's block. In Calidor, downtrodden servant March seeks revenge on the prince who betrayed his people. In Pitoria, feckless Edyon steals cheap baubles for cheaper thrills as he drifts from town to town. And in the barren northern territories, 13-year-old Tash is running for her life as she plays bait for the gruff demon hunter Gravell."

Anyone who knows me well knows I am really into YA Fantasy at the moment so when I heard about <cite>The Smoke Thieves</cite> I knew I had to read it. WOW! I am so glad I did!

This book had everything I look for in a YA Fantasy and more: magic, exciting kingdoms, a fast-paced plot and characters that I couldn't help but love. The demons' unique magic certainly helped the book stand out. The plot had me hooked from the first page and I literally couldn't stop reading.

I'm not usually one to like multiple points of view in fiction, but with <cite>The Smoke Thieves</cite> I think it worked. I'll admit, at first I was a bit confused about how all these characters were going to connect, but as I got further through the story I started to piece together how it may happen and I was shocked when I got the full picture.

If I was going to say anything negative, it would be that I wanted to find out more about the demons. I am, however, hoping this comes up further into the series.

<cite>The Smoke Thieves</cite> was a thrilling read that had me gripped. It has a unique take on the YA Fantasy genre and this is certainly a series that I can't wait to read more of.
