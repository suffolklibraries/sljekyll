> "Cousins Amy and Dee were kidnapped by a stranger as children. Now, 16-year-old Amy is back with her parents. Dressed in purple and clutching a plastic doll, she refuses to answer questions.

> "As Amy struggles towards a normal teenage life, her family - and the police - press her for information. Unable to escape her past, Amy realizes she has to confront the truth. How did she survive? How did she escape? And what happened to Dee?"

<cite>Amy Chelsea Stacie Dee</cite> is quite some book. It was riveting to the point that I really couldnâ€™t stop reading until I knew what had happened.

It hooks you in straight away with an explosive opening scene. I loved how the plot was like a puzzle and you gradually got the pieces.

This book is well-written and I really enjoyed it. I definitely would recommend it for older readers only, though, as it tackles some very dark and mature themes.
