Audrey is an aspiring actor, Harry is an aspiring film director. When they meet at the local independent cinema where they both work, romance must surely ensue. Well... in the fine tradition of romances and romantic comedies everywhere, that would be telling.

Hilarious, lovely, moving and heartbreaking, this book was brilliant, I just couldn’t put it down. I rooted for all the characters and I did find myself shouting at them when they let me down.

Plus, it contains so many of my favourite things: film, a love of independent cinema and avocado. How could I not love it? Cinnamon dust? Well, I can take it or leave that to be honest.

I would definitely recommend giving <cite>It Only Happens in the Movies</cite> a whirl. You won’t be disappointed, and if you love film, there’s a whole host of very satisfying cinematic nods.
