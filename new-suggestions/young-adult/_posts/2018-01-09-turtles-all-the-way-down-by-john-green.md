**[See <cite>Turtles All The Way Down</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2263773)**

> "It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. <cite>Turtles All the Way Down</cite> is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts."

I must admit that when I first heard about <cite>Turtles All The Way Down</cite>, I was worried that it would be dull compared with Green's last book, the phenomenal [<cite>The Fault in Our Stars</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1332782). Although nothing will ever live up to <cite>The Fault in Our Stars</cite> for me, though, this is an absolutely outstanding comeback that I loved. I'm certain this will be remembered as one of the books of 2017.

Aza is a brilliant character. Green has created a realistic, wonderful portrayal of someone with OCD (an illness he has himself) which was so refreshing to see. <cite>Turtles All The Way Down</cite> is part of a growing range of amazing Young Adult novels which accurately portray mental illness, and reminded me of Holly Bourne's [<cite>Am I Normal Yet</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1791948), another book about a protagonist with OCD that I loved. By including diverse characters such as Aza's Latinx best friend, Daisy, Green also helps establish diversity as a key characteristic of YA books.

<cite>Turtles All The Way Down</cite> is a smart book filled with dark humour which will stay with you long after the final page. It is a love letter to nerd culture, and I loved all the Star Wars references. I would strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a new YA read, though some of the themes might be a little too dark for younger readers.
