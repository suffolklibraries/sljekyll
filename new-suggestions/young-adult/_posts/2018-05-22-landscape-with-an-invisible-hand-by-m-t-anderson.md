> "When the vuvv first landed, it came as a surprise to aspiring artist Adam and the rest of planet Earth - but not necessarily an unwelcome one. Can it really be called an invasion when the vuvv generously offered free advanced technology and cures for every illness imaginable?

> "As it turns out, yes. With his parents' jobs replaced by alien tech and no money for food, clean water, or the vuvv's miraculous medicine, Adam and his girlfriend, Chloe, have to get creative to survive. And since the vuvv crave anything they deem classic Earth culture (doo-wop music, still life paintings of fruit, true love), recording 1950s-style dates for the vuvv to watch in a pay-per-minute format seems like a brilliant idea.

> "But it's hard for Adam and Chloe to sell true love when they hate each other more with every passing episode."

If, like me, you enjoy the science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, you will enjoy this book. In common with such retro science fiction, this is a biting social satire, bringing the genre into the present day by addressing the issues of the increasing divisions between rich and poor, first- and third-world, and haves and have-nots.
