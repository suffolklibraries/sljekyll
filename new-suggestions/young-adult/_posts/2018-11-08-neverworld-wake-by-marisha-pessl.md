> "Five friends - the beautiful elite at their exclusive prep school - reunite a year after graduation. After a night out, they narrowly avoid a collision with a car on a deserted road.

> "Back at the mansion belonging to one of the girls, a storm rages and a mysterious man knocks on the door, announcing something world-shattering. The friends must make a choice: one of them will live, and the rest will die. And the decision must be unanimous. So begins the 'Neverworld Wake'."

<cite>Neverworld Wake</cite> is the type of book that sucks you in and never really lets you go. The fast-paced plot kept me engrossed until the last page.

The best way I could describe this would be a dark, gripping mix of <cite>Groundhog Day</cite> and [<cite>The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle</cite>, by Stuart Turton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317303) - a fantastical Agatha Christie meets Doctor Who adult mystery that I loved.

The supernatural element is well done, but the real beauty of the book lay in the characters themselves. Every one, with possibly the exception of Jim, felt interesting and developed well over the course of the book.

The sci-fi aspect just amplified the claustrophobic atmosphere and the conflict between the characters for me, which was perfect for a YA mystery.

<cite>Neverworld Wake</cite> is a thought-provoking and original mystery that will continue to surprise you.
