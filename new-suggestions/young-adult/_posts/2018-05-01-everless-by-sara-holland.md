> "In the land of Sempera, the rich control everything - even time. Ever since the age of alchemy and sorcery, hours, days and years have been extracted from blood and bound to iron coins. The rich live for centuries; the poor bleed themselves dry.

> "Jules and her father are behind on their rent and low on hours. To stop him from draining himself to clear their debts, Jules takes a job at Everless, the grand estate of the cruel Gerling family. There, Jules encounters danger and temptation in the guise of the Gerling heir, Roan, who is soon to be married. But the web of secrets at Everless stretches beyond her desire and the truths Jules must uncover will change her life for ever - and possibly the future of time itself."

Wow, <cite>Everless</cite> was an awesome read. It just captivated me, with Sara Holland building a wonderful world that I didn’t want to leave. The whole concept is just brilliant and I was definitely left wanting more.

I was immediately drawn to this book by the fascinating idea of time as a currency. Beyond the gorgeous cover is a carefully-crafted world of secrets and lies. It is full of strong yet relateable and flawed characters, whom I loved. I also really liked the twists, which I didn’t see coming.

<cite>Everless</cite> is an awesome, fantastic and really riveting debut in a new fantasy series you should keep an eye out for.
