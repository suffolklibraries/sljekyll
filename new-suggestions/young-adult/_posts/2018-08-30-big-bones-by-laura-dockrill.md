> "Bluebelle, aka BB, aka Big Bones, is a sixteen-year-old girl encouraged to tackle her weight even though she's perfectly happy, thank you, and getting on with her life and in love with food. Then a tragedy in the family forces BB to find a new relationship with her body and herself."

Big Bones is a hilarious, sweet and memorable protagonist, and her story is a lovely, light, feel-good romance.

It's refreshing and brilliant to see a body-confident, self-loving main character in YA, and the book is very honest about body image issues. It's also really funny and feels very authentic. My fellow Suffolk Libraries YA reviewer Amy also enjoyed it.

<cite>Big Bones</cite> is an original, amazing YA contemporary. Laura Dockrill has created a beautiful ode to food and loving yourself no matter what.
