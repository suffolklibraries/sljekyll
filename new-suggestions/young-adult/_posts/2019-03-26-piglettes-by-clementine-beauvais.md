> "Awarded the Gold, Silver and Bronze trotters after a vote by their classmates on Facebook, Mireille, Astrid and Hakima are officially the three ugliest girls in their school, but does that mean they're going to sit around crying about it? Well, yes, a bit, but not for long! Climbing aboard their bikes, the trio set off on a summer road trip to Paris, their goal: a garden party with the French president.

> "As news of their trip spreads they become stars of social media and television. With the eyes of the nation upon them, the girls find fame, friendship and happiness, and still have time to consume an enormous amount of food along the way."

I discovered Clémentine Beauvais when I read [<cite>In Paris with You</cite>](/new-suggestions/young-adult/in-paris-with-you-by-clementine-beauvais/). <cite>Piglettes</cite> is her other novel for young adults, and it did not disappoint. I laughed out loud at times and was inspired and uplifted at others. If ever we needed a book about the power of friendship and sausages against the need for fame and beauty, this is the novel to read.

I loved this book, and will be keeping a keen eye on what Clémentine does next and grabbing for it with arms open wide!
