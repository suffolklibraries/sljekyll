Miss V Conroy is quiet and good at keeping secrets. She becomes the companion to Princess Victoria, and lives under a very strict regime, the 'Kensington System', instigated by her father Sir John Conroy.

Who will ultimately win her loyalty? Her best friend/sister or her father? Miss V begins to realise she is stronger then she may seem.

I had my reservations when I first started this book but grew to really enjoy it. Rather than sticking rigidly to facts, Lucy Worsley has created an alternative universe where two girls grow to womanhood in a repressive 'protective' system but ultimately turn it to their own advantage. The ending gives a very different take on a well-known period in history and will make you curious about the real Conroy family.

If you love the history of the monarchy, <cite>My Name is Victoria</cite> promises to be an enjoyable read.
