> "The Shadow Fold, a swathe of impenetrable darkness, crawling with monsters that feast on human flesh, is slowly destroying the once-great nation of Ravka. Alina, a pale, lonely orphan, discovers a unique power that thrusts her into the lavish world of the kingdom's magical elite - the Grisha. Could she be the key to unravelling the dark fabric of the Shadow Fold and setting Ravka free?"

Leigh Bardugo weaves a lush fantasy world with a wonderfully imaginative magic system in her debut, <cite>Shadow and Bone</cite>. This book is packed with magic, politics, characters you'll love, characters you'll hate and ones you'll love to hate. It's set in a Russian-inspired world and draws on that history and culture, so it feels a lot more grounded and real than a lot of other fantasy books. It's super fast-paced and exciting - I don't think I've read something so gripping and unputdownable in a long time.

<cite>Shadow and Bone</cite> is not hugely complicated or long like many high fantasies, so if you're just looking to get into fantasy or you're on the younger end of YA, I think this would be a perfect place to start. But be warned - this book only scratches the surface and once you're drawn in to Bardugo's world of 'Grisha' magic you won't be able to stop!

Netflix has just announced that it's developing a show based on Bardugo's GrishaVerse (this trilogy and the subsequent Six of Crows duology), so make sure you're ready for the big release by reading the books first!
