> "It's the accident season, the same time every year. Bones break, skin tears, bruises bloom.

> "Towards the end of October, foreshadowed by the deaths of many relatives before them, Cara's family becomes inexplicably accident-prone. They banish all dangers to locked drawers - but injuries follow wherever they go and the accident season becomes an ever-growing obsession and fear."

This phenomenal debut novel, packed full of exquisite imagery, magic and secrets, is one of those books that just grabs you and refuses to let go. It is edgy, dark and there are twists that will really shock and surprise you.

I adored the dreamy fairy-tale sequences that blurred between fantasy and reality; they added a sense of magic to the dark plot. Fowley-Doyle’s writing style is so beautiful and lyrical that I physically couldn’t put the book down.

This book is perfect for a cold, wintery day when you just want to snuggle up inside. I would strongly recommend it for fans of [<cite>We Were Liars</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1615611) or [<cite>The Graces</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1996828).

<cite>The Accident Season</cite> is a darkly beautiful tale with an ethereal, magical tone, strong narrative and twists that leave you breathless.
