## [<cite>Who Runs the World?</cite>, by Virginia Begin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160824)

> "Welcome to the Matriarchy. 60 years after a virus has wiped out almost all the men on the planet, things are pretty much just as you would imagine a world run by women might be: war has ended; greed is not tolerated; the ecological needs of the planet are always put first. In two generations, the female population has grieved, pulled together and moved on, and life really is pretty good - if you're a girl. It's not so great if you're a boy, but 14 year-old River wouldn't know that. Until she met Mason, she thought they were extinct."

A dystopian thriller with more than a touch of romance.

## [<cite>Tender Earth</cite>, by Sita Brahmachari](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2161451)

> "Returning to the world of [<cite>Artichoke Hearts</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160827), this story follows eleven-year-old Laila, the youngest of the Levenson family, as she adjusts to Mira and Krish, her two older siblings, leaving home, just as she is starting secondary school. At the same time she seems to be growing apart from her long-time best friend, Kez, who is branching out without her at their new school. Laila must find her own place at school and at home, make new friends and discover her voice as she steps out into the world."

## [<cite>Hero Rising</cite>, by Shane Hegarty](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2153952)

> "Things can't get any worse. Legends are running riot. Half-hunters are out of control. Darkmouth has been taken away from Finn and Emmie, and Finn's dad Hugo - proud Legend Hunter - is washing dogs for a living. But something even more terrifying lurks beneath the surface: an ancient horror threatening both our world and the Infested Side. So scratch that. Things can get worse. Much worse. More than ever, Darkmouth is going to need a hero. Sadly, all it's got is Finn."

This fourth title in the edge-of-the-seat supernatural series <cite>Darkmouth</cite> looks set to be the scariest yet. Too scary for me, but not for the legions of brave fans in Suffolk Libraries, who laugh in the face of fear!

## [<cite>Troublemakers</cite>, by Catherine Barter](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2152570)

> "Fifteen-year-old Alena never really knew her political activist mother, who died when she was a baby. She has grown up with her older half-brother Danny and his boyfriend Nick in the east end of London. Now the area is threatened by a bomber who has been leaving explosive devices in supermarkets. It is only a matter of time before a bomb goes off.

> "Against this increasingly fearful backdrop, Alena seeks to discover more about her past, while Danny takes a job working for a controversial politician. As her family life implodes, and the threat to Londoners mounts, Alena starts getting into trouble. Then she does something truly rebellious."

## [<cite>Day 7</cite>, by Kerry Drewery](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2153882)

> "Martha Honeydew has been released from the terrifying Cell 7. But despite her new freedom, the corrupt judicial system is still tracking Martha's every move. And Isaac, her only trusted friend, is now imprisoned in the very same cells she was. Isaac saved Martha's life, it is only right she now saves his.

> "But with Martha still a target, her chances of saving Isaac are remote. Martha begins to question whether it is ever possible to escape government scrutiny. Will Martha and Isaac ever reunite? Will they ever live in a better world?"

This is the tense sequel to the dystopian thriller [<cite>Cell 7</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2026617), where all decisions are made by public vote.

## [<cite>After The Fire</cite>, by Will Hill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2154036)

Set in a religious cult community in the Texas desert, this is "a powerful atmospheric tale of love, loss and courage".

Prequel to the bestselling <cite>Malediction</cite> trilogy.

## [<cite>Truth or Dare</cite>, by Non Pratt](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2154023)

> "Claire Casey hates being the centre of attention. But when she meets the charming Sef and finds out his older brother, Kam, has been paralyzed in an accident she wants to help them both. Claire and Sef start playing an online game of truth or dare to raise money for Kam's care, but as the dares become more dramatic, they discover that love can be the most dangerous game of all."

## [<cite>If Birds Fly Back</cite>, by Carlie Sorosiak](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160206)

If you like Rainbow Rowell, try this romance by a new author, set in sun-drenched Florida:

> "Linny has been living life in black and white since her sister Grace ran away, and she's scared that Grace might never come back. When Linny witnesses the return to Miami of a cult movie star long presumed dead, she is certain it's a sign. Surely Herrera, of all people, can tell her why people come back - and how to bring her sister home?

> "Sebastian has come to Miami seeking his father, a man whose name he's only just learned. An aspiring astrophysicist, he can tell Linny how many galaxies there are, how much plutonium weighs and how likely she is to be struck by a meteorite. But none of the theories he knows are enough to answer his own questions about why his father abandoned him, and why it left him in pieces"
