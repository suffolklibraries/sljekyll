> "Colin Fischer is 14 and has Asperger's. Although he struggles to understand human emotions, he's brilliant at logical deduction.

> "When a gun fires into the ceiling of the school cafeteria, everyone blames Wayne, school bully and usual suspect. But Colin Fischer turns detective; only he spots a connection between the gun and some birthday cake."

This is the story of Colin, who doesn't like to be touched or the colour blue. He has the opportunity to prove someone's innocence and make a best friend.

I particularly enjoyed the diary entries and footnotes that run alongside the story. Another highlight is the inclusion of the flashcards Colin uses to identify people's emotions in the book.

I was recommended <cite>Colin Fischer</cite>, by a colleague, and in turn would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Mark Haddon's [<cite>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1619086).
