> "After Will's brother is shot in a gang crime, he knows the next steps. Don't cry. Don't snitch. Get revenge. So he gets in the lift with Shawn's gun, determined to follow The Rules.

> "Only when the lift door opens, Buck walks in, Will's friend who died years ago. And Dani, who was shot years before that. As more people from his past arrive, Will has to ask himself if he really knows what he's doing."

This book will haunt me. It was just so powerful and beautiful that I can’t get it out of my head.

Every line is packed full of emotion and the prose just feels so visceral. Like Sarah Crossan, Reynolds uses verse to devastating effect.

This book deals with important topics in an outstanding, nuanced way. Every sentence shudders with raw emotion, which makes it an experience to read. You are swept up in the story completely, feeling everything the protagonist does. All the characters break out of the confines of the pages. They feel like real people, making the novel even more devastating.

<cite>Long Way Down</cite> is an unforgettable book that you won’t be able to put down.
