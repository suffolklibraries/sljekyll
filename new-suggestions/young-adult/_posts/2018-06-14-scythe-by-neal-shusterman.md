> "In a world where disease, war and crime have been eliminated, the only way to die is to be randomly killed by professional scythes. Citra and Rowan are teenagers who have been selected to be scythes' apprentices, and despite wanting nothing to do with the vocation, they must learn the art of killing and understand the necessity of what they do.

> "Only one of them will be chosen as a scythe's apprentice and as Citra and Rowan come up against a terrifyingly corrupt Scythedom, it becomes clear that the winning apprentice's first task will be to kill the loser."

<cite>Scythe</cite> is a force of nature. A brilliant, engrossing, clever series opener that makes you question the world around you. It deals with complex moral issues without seeming preachy.

Shusterman has created an engaging and layered world that draws you in from the first page. The concept is so original and interesting that you can’t help but take notice.

Throughout the story you come across cryptic journal excerpts that lead to one of the best twists in the book. Both narrators feel distinctive and unique and you can’t help but sympathise with them.

<cite>Scythe</cite> is a gripping book that I devoured in one sitting. Now I just need the sequel!
