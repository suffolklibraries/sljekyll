> "17-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice's life on the road, always a step ahead of the strange bad luck biting at their heels.

> "But when Alice's grandmother, the reclusive author of a book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate - the Hazel Wood - Alice learns how bad her luck can really get. Her mother is stolen away - by a figure who claims to come from the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set.

> "Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: 'Stay away from the Hazel Wood'. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began."

Fairytales just got darker. These aren’t the saccharine Disney versions of your childhood; these are dark, creepy and bizarre.

My favourite parts of <cite>The Hazel Wood</cite> are definitely the extracts from Alice's grandmother's book, <cite>Tales from the Hinterland</cite>. Albert plans to publish a full collection of the tales in 2020, and I can't wait. The stories are just so intoxicatingly creepy and dark.

<cite>The Hazel Wood</cite> is a mesmerizing, intriguing debut that will sweep you off your feet.
