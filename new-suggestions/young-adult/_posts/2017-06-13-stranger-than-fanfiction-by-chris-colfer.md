Chris Colfer has struck gold again with this fantastic exploration of our celebrity-obsessed modern culture and how our idols aren’t as perfect as we think.

Cash Carter is the young, world-famous lead actor of <cite>Wiz Kids</cite>, a zany <cite>Doctor Who</cite>–esque television show. When four fans jokingly invite him on a cross-country road trip, they are shocked that he actually takes them up on it. Chased by paparazzi and hounded by reporters, this unlikely crew takes off on a journey of a lifetime, but along the way they discover that the star they love has deep secrets he's been keeping. What they come to learn about the life of the mysterious person they thought they knew will teach them about the power of empathy and the unbreakable bond of true friendship.

This book was packed full of brilliant characters and highlighted several important issues in our society. It also reflects on the powerful culture of fans and the real price of celebrity, something that Colfer (of <cite>Glee</cite> fame) would know all about. It really took me on an emotional journey: there was wickedly sarcastic humour throughout the book but I also sobbed at the touching ending.

To sum up, <cite>Stranger Than Fanfiction</cite> is a brilliant novel that I would recommend for any YA fans who love a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour but also want to really connect with the characters and go on a journey with them.
