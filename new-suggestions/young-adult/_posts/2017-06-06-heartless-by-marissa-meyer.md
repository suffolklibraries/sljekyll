Prepare to travel down the rabbit hole once more, but not to the Wonderland you know...

<cite>Heartless</cite>, another fairytale with a twist from Marissa Meyer, is about the Queen of Hearts before Alice arrived in her kingdom. We meet Catherine, a sweet but fierce heroine who just wants to bake but, unluckily, the King of Hearts has fallen in love with her, and her status-obsessed parents stand in the way of her dreams.

At a royal ball where Cath is expected to receive the King’s marriage proposal, she meets handsome and mysterious Jest. For the first time, she feels the pull of true attraction. Cath is determined to choose her own destiny. But in a land laden with magic, madness, and monsters, fate has other plans.

I adored <cite>Heartless</cite>. Yes, it is another forbidden romance but it isn’t clichéd. There are twists around every corner and this book just throws a tornado of emotions straight at you. Elements of romance, murder-mystery and that elusive tinge of darkness made this book just perfect.

Throughout the book there are delightful comments on Victorian Britain, with particular emphasis on the social ideas of women and relationships. This was another brilliant touch that added to the overall effect of the story.

<cite>Heartless</cite> is a madcap, magical take on <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> that is heartbreaking and simply magnificent.
