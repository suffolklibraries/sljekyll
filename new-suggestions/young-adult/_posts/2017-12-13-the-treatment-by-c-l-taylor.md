> "All 16-year-old Drew Finch wants is to be left alone. She's not interested in spending time with her mum and stepdad, and when her disruptive little brother, Mason, is expelled from school for the third time and sent to a residential reform academy she's almost relieved.

> "Everything changes when she's followed home from school by the mysterious Dr Cobey, who claims to have a message from Mason. There is something sinister about the 'treatment' he is undergoing. The school is changing people. Determined to help her brother, Drew must infiltrate the academy and unearth its deepest, darkest secrets before it's too late."

I have enjoyed C. L. Taylor’s previous novels so was quite excited to see she had written a novel for young adults. True to form I was gripped from the very first sentence, "they’re still following me."

<cite>The Treatment</cite> is pacy, moving at a speed that keeps you hooked. I'd recommend it to thriller-lovers of any age. Will there be a sequel? See what you think once you get to the end!
