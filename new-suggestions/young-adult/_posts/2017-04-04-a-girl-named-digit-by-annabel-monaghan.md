> "Farrah 'Digit' Higgins has left her geek self behind in another school district so she can blend in with the popular crowd at Santa Monica High and actually enjoy her senior year. But when Farrah, the daughter of a UCLA math professor, unknowingly cracks a terrorist group's number sequence, her laid-back senior year gets a lot more interesting. Soon she is personally investigating the case, on the run from terrorists, and faking her own kidnapping-all while trying to convince a young, hot FBI agent to take her seriously."

This is a quick read and I enjoyed seeing where it would lead. Digit has spent her high school years hiding from who she really is. Having her life endangered makes her realise she is better off being her true self, and she may just fall in love at the same time.

A book full of adventure, mystery, love and humour ... it has it all.
