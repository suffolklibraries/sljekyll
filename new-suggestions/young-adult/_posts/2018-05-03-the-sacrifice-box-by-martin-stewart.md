> "Sep, Arkle, Mack, Lamb and Hadley: five friends, thrown together one hot, sultry summer. When they discover an ancient, mysterious stone box hidden in the forest, they decide to each make a sacrifice: something special to each of them, committed to the box for ever. And they make a pact: they will never return to the box at night; they'll never visit it alone; and they'll never take back their offerings.

> "Four years later, the gang have drifted apart. Then a series of strange and terrifying events take place, and Sep and his friends understand that one of them has broken the pact. As their sacrifices haunt them with increased violence and hunger, they soon realise that they are not the first children to have found the box in their town's history. And ultimately, the box may want the greatest sacrifice of all: one of them."

<cite>The Sacrifice Box</cite> is one heck of a book. It’s dark, mysterious and eerily atmospheric. Stewart has written an addictive and haunting tale that includes a great message about the power of friendship and coming of age.

The premise drew me in straight away with its spooky but unique nature. Luckily, the rest of the book lived up to the hook.

<cite>The Sacrifice Box</cite> is a frightening and gripping horror that’s perfect for a dark night.
