> "Tamar is admitted to Lime Grove, a psychiatric ward for teenagers, where the psychologists ask her endless questions. How did the self-harming start? Will you tell us what happened?

<cite>On A Scale Of One To Ten</cite> took my breath away.

Scott has created an honest portrayal of mental health problems thatâ€™s a quick, powerful read. I really, really liked it and devoured the story. Character Tamar is easy to engage with, so I kept wanting to know more about her.

<cite>On A Scale Of One To Ten</cite> is raw, dark and stunning. It puts [<cite>13 Reasons Why</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2147327) completely in the shade. Two words: utterly brilliant.
