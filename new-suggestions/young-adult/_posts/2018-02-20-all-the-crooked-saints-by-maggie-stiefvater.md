> "Any visitor to Bicho Raro, Colorado, is likely to find a landscape of dark saints, forbidden love, scientific dreams, miracle-mad owls, estranged affections, one or two orphans, and a sky full of watchful desert stars.

> "At the heart of this place you will find the Soria family, who all have the ability to perform unusual miracles. And at the heart of this family are three cousins longing to change its future: Beatriz, the girl without feelings, who wants only to be free to examine her thoughts; Daniel, the Saint of Bicho Raro, who performs miracles for everyone but himself; and Joaquin, who spends his nights running a renegade radio station under the name Diablo Diablo. They are all looking for a miracle. But the miracles of Bicho Raro are never quite what you expect."

How do I even begin to describe this book? Magical, miraculous, haunting, enigmatic, allegorical, fantastical and filled with owls doesn't seem to do it justice. What I will say is that if you borrow this book, you will get a story which grabs hold of you, draws you in and keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next.

The writing is so atmospheric I felt like I was in the Colorado desert with these extraordinary characters and I was completely satisfied by the way it turned out.

I will definitely be reading more Maggie Stiefvater.
