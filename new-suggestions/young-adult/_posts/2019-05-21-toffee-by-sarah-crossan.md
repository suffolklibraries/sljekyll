> "'I'm Allison. I'm here because I've nowhere else to go.'"

> "Allison is alone, Marla is alone. Soon they will come together.

> "Allison has run away from home and takes refuge in a shed in a house she thinks is abandoned. Marla lives in that house and thinks Allison is a friend from her past called Toffee. What follows is an 'exploration of identity, mental health & friendship' and a realisation that "'Weâ€™re alone together.'"

Have you ever read a verse novel? Sarah Crossan is the reason I love this style of writing. Since I read her Carnegie Medal winning book [<cite>One</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1976758) in 2016, I have devoured every verse novel she has published, and one she recommended as well!

I can confidently say that when I pick up one of Crossan's books, I won't put it down again easily. <cite>Toffee</cite> was no exception; like her other books, it is a quick read that nonetheless stays with you long after you have read the final page. I found it a very appropriate read for Mental Health Awareness Week, and page 365 in particular is an amazing example of the author's poetic talent.

I would definitely recommend <cite>Toffee</cite> to anyone - and that you go on to read the rest of Crossan's books if you haven't already!
