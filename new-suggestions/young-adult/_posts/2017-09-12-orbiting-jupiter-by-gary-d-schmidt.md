**[See <cite>Orbiting Jupiter</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1880837)**

Jack has a new foster brother, Joseph. Joseph almost killed a teacher, has been incarcerated and he has a daughter called Jupiter whom he has never seen. Oh, and he is only 14! As Jack learns more about Joseph and what has happened to him, he finds himself helping in ways he never knew he had in him in Joseph's quest to find Jupiter.

A very quick read that moves at a good pace, I read this book in less then 24 hours and could not put it down. I was with Jack and Joseph every step of the way to find Jupiter, going through a series of emotions along the way.

I loved this book and have recommended to others already. Reserve it now!
