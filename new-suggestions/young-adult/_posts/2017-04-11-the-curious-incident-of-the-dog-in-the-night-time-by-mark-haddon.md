**[See <cite>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1619086).**

In <cite>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</cite>, 15-year-old narrator Christopher John Francis Boone discovers the body of his neighbour's poodle, Wellington, on the neighbours' front lawn one morning and sets out to uncover the murderer.

All of the characters felt real to me. I loved reading about them because they are all very secretive and mysterious. However, I did find that some of them were hard to understand. My favourite character is Mr Shears, Christopher's mother's new partner, as he has a mysterious back story, leading Christopher to consider him a suspect in Wellington's murder.

Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book because of the amazing plot and characters, and would give it 4/5 stars.
