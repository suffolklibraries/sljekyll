<cite>Welcome to Nowhere</cite> is simply a beautiful book. It’s immersive, honest and carries a strong message.

Twelve-year-old Omar and his brothers and sisters were born and raised in the beautiful and bustling city of Bosra, Syria. They’re just a typical family until Omar’s clever older brother, Musa, gets mixed up with some young political activists. Then everything changes...

Before long, bombs are falling, people are dying, and Omar and his family have no choice but to flee their home with only what they can carry. Yet no matter how far they run, the shadow of war follows them - until they have no other choice than to attempt the dangerous journey to escape their homeland altogether. But where do you go when you can't go home?

This is one of the most important issues of our time and Laird tackles it head-on. It is a heart-wrenching tale with tenderly emotional scenes. Accompanying Laird’s powerful and immersive writing are some spectacular illustrations that made me love this book even more.

<cite>Welcome to Nowhere</cite> is an immensely well-researched book that fearlessly tackles a worldwide issue.
