> "Eugene and Tatiana could have fallen in love. If things had gone differently. If they had tried to really know each other. If it had just been them, and not the others.

> "But that was years ago and time has found them far apart, leading separate lives. Until they meet once more in Paris. What really happened back then? And now? Could they ever be together after everything?"

I am a huge fan of the verse novel, so I fell in love with this book from the very first pages. It is very cleverly written and beautifully presented (check out pages 332 and 333 especially). It definitely reminded me of the author Sarah Crossan, who I love.

Containing hints of Romeo and Juliet and many other star-crossed lovers besides, <cite>In Paris With You</cite> keeps you reading to find out if Eugene and Tatiana are destined to be together... you’ll have to read it yourself to find out!

<cite>In Paris With You</cite> is one of my favourite books of 2018. I would recommend it to older teens and adults as there are a lot of references of a sexual nature throughout.
