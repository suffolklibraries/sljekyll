## [<cite>The Empty Grave</cite>, by Jonathan Stroud](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2196162)

Jonathan Stroud, author of the brilliant Bartimaeus Sequence series, returns with a new addition to his thrilling ghost-hunting Lockwood and Co. series.

> "After their recent adventures, the Lockwood & Co team deserve a well-earned break, so naturally they decide to risk their lives breaking into a heavily-guarded crypt. A building full of unsettled souls, it's also the final resting place of Marissa Fittes, the legendary and (supposedly) long dead ghost hunter. What they discover their will change everything.

> "So begins a race to get to the truth behind 'the Problem', and an epic struggle against the Fittes agency. A struggle that will pit the team against the most terrifying enemy they have ever faced. Not even the dead will survive unscathed."

> "The Felmotte family have a dark and terrible secret: inheriting the title of Lord Felmotte means not only taking on centuries of family history, political allegiance and land, but also the souls of seven previous patriarchs - jostling for space within the poor beleaguered body of the heir. When civil war takes the Felmotte men into battle for King Charles, attention turns to 15-year-old Kate, the illegitimate child of the current heir, in possession of the family 'talent'.

> "Working as a servant and kept around in case of just such an emergency, Kate knows what that attention might mean and, rather than become a vessel for the bickering souls of generations of angry, volatile men, arms herself the best way she can - by taking on the spirit of a very angry, very dead bear."

Alone in space, she is the loneliest girl in the universe until she hears about a new ship which has launched from Earth - with a single passenger on board. A boy called J.

> "Their only communication is via email - and due to the distance between them, their messages take months to transmit. And yet Romy finds herself falling in love. But what does Romy really know about J? And what do the mysterious messages which have started arriving from Earth really mean? Sometimes, there's something worse than being alone."

In order to save the human race, she must literally fight the other species."

Evelyn is seventeen, and though she is rich and clever, she may never be allowed to follow her older brother to university. Enraged that she is expected to marry her childhood sweetheart rather than be educated, she joins the Suffragettes, and vows to pay the ultimate price for women's freedom. May is fifteen, and already sworn to the cause, though she and her fellow Suffragists refuse violence. When she meets Nell, a girl who's grown up in hardship, she sees a kindred spirit. Together and in love, the two girls start to dream of a world where all kinds of women have their place."

> "As 14-year-old Ella begins her first day at work she steps into a world of silks, seams, scissors, pins, hems and trimmings. She is a dressmaker, but this is no ordinary sewing workshop. Hers are no ordinary clients. Ella has joined the seamstresses of Birkenau-Auschwitz, as readers may recognise it. Every dress she makes could mean the difference between life and death. And this place is all about survival.

> "Ella seeks refuge from this reality, and from haunting memories, in her work and in the world of fashion and fabrics. She is faced with painful decisions about how far she is prepared to go to survive. Is her love of clothes and creativity nothing more than collaboration with her captors, or is it a means of staying alive?"
