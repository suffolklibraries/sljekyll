<cite>Here I Stand: stories that stand for freedom</cite> is a collection of stories by famous authors
such as Neil Gaiman, Matt Haig, Frances Hardinge and Jackie Kay. Edited by Amnesty International UK, it covers issues including suicide, child soldiers, LGBT, religious fanaticism, child trafficking, refugees and much more.

A colleague recommended this book to me and while I wasn't initially sure whether I'd like it, I ended up loving it, not least because one of the contributors is Sarah Crossan, one of my favourite authors.

<cite>Here I Stand</cite> is thought-provoking and deeply moving. I can't praise it enough and urge you to reserve a copy today.
