> "Lucy Hansson was ready for a perfect summer with her boyfriend, working at her childhood Bible camp on the lake and spending quality time with her parents. But when her mum's cancer reappears, Lucy falters - in her faith and in her ability to cope. When her boyfriend 'pauses' their relationship and her summer job switches to a different camp - one for troubled kids - Lucy isn't sure how much more she can handle.

> "Attempting to accept a new normal, Lucy slowly regains footing among her vibrant, diverse coworkers, Sundays with her mum, and a crush on a fellow counselor. But when long-hidden family secrets emerge, can Lucy set aside her problems and discover what grace really means?"

In <cite>The Names They Gave Us</cite>, Lord deals wonderfully with many issues such as LGBT, race, religion and cancer with with delicate precision and real thought behind her writing.

I loved how diverse the characters were and it was refreshing to see that they were all given backstories. None of them were like the standard walking clich√©s you get in a lot of contemporary YA fiction, which was brilliant.

Prepare for a classic summer romance packed full of love, heartache, friends and family from an author to watch.
