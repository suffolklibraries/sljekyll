> "Can a text message destroy your life? Carver Briggs never thought a simple text would cause a fatal crash, killing his three best friends, Mars, Eli, and Blake. Now Carver can't stop blaming himself for the accident and even worse, there could be a criminal investigation into the deaths.

> "Then Blake's grandmother asks Carver to remember her grandson with a 'goodbye day' together. Carver has his misgivings, but he starts to help the families of his lost friends grieve with their own memorial days, along with Eli's bereaved girlfriend Jesmyn. But not everyone is willing to forgive. Carver's own despair and guilt threatens to pull him under into panic and anxiety as he faces punishment for his terrible mistake. Can the goodbye days really help?"

Jeff Zentner caught my eye with his brilliant book [<cite>The Serpent King</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1926782) when I read it last year, so my hopes were high <cite>Goodbye Days</cite>. Luckily, Zentner managed to exceed my expectations with this simply beautiful book.

With <cite>Goodbye Days</cite>, Zentnerâ€™s delivered another emotionally-charged masterpiece that I am sure any fans of this genre will love. The story just resonated with me and the characters in the pages have stayed with me, particularly Carver. He was darkly funny, honest and so fragile.

<cite>Goodbye Days</cite> is a heart-breaking but magnificent novel by a writer to watch.
