## [<cite>Somebody Give This Heart a Pen</cite>, by Sophia Thakur](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2640293)

> "From internationally acclaimed performance poet Sophia Thakur comes a powerful collection of poems exploring issues of identity, love, loss, family, and faith.

> "Sophia Thakur began performing poetry at the age of sixteen, and is known for her strong narrative voice and emotional empathy. Her remarkable debut encourages young people to look outside of themselves and to explore their own hearts' journeys through poetry."

## [<cite>Can You See Me?</cite>, by Libby Scott & Rebecca Westcott](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2556122)

> "People think that because Tally's autistic, she doesn't realise what they're thinking, but Tally sees and hears - and notices - all of it.

> "Endearing, insightful and warmly uplifting, this is a story of autism, empathy and kindness that will touch readers of all ages."

## [<cite>Furious Thing</cite>, by Jenny Downham](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2590876)

> "<em>Bad things happen when you're around, Lex...</em>

> "That's what her stepfather tells her. That's what she believes about herself.

> "But how can she convince herself and everyone around her that her anger doesn't make her a monster? If only she could stop losing her temper and behave herself, her step-father would accept her, her mum would love her like she used to and her step-brother would declare his crushing desire to spend the rest of his life with her. She wants these things so badly she determines to swallow her anger and make her family proud. But pushing fury down doesn’t make it disappear. Instead, it simmers below the surface waiting to erupt. There’ll be fireworks when it does."

Stevie's mum teases her that someday they'll get married, but Stevie knows that won't ever happen. There's a girl at school that she likes more. A lot more. Actually, she's a bit confused about how much she likes her. It's nothing like the way she likes Andrew. It makes her fizz inside. That's a new feeling, one she doesn't understand.

> "Stevie needs to find out if girls can like girls - love them, even - but it's hard to get any information, and she's too shy to ask out loud about it. But maybe she can find an answer in a book. With the help of a librarian, Stevie finds stories of girls loving girls, and builds up her courage to share the truth with her mum."

> "Serving detention one day, Ilyas finds a kindred spirit in Kelly Matthews, who is fed up with being pigeonholed as the good girl, and their friendship blows the social strata of high school wide open. But when Kelly catches the eye of one of the local bad boys, Imran, he decides to seduce her for a bet - and Ilyas is faced with losing the only person who understands him. Standing up to Imran puts Ilyas' family at risk, but it's time for him to be the superhero he draws in his comic-books, and go kick the moon."

> "Frank Li is a high school senior living in Southern California. Frank's parents emigrated from Korea, and have pretty much one big rule for Frank - he must only date Korean girls. But he's got strong feelings for a girl in his class, Brit - and she's not Korean. His friend Joy Song is in the same boat and knows her parents will never accept her Chinese American boyfriend, so they make a pact: they'll pretend to date each other in order to gain their freedom.

> "Frank thinks fake-dating is the perfect plan, but it leaves him wondering if he ever really understood love - or himself - at all."

> "Jemima Small finds it hard to measure up. Especially because she's the very opposite of her name. And being forced to join a healthy eating group at school means no one will let her forget that. But if there's one big thing she has going for her it's her attitude - and she's determined to prove that Jemima Small is a Big Deal."
