> "She will become a legend but first she is Diana, Princess of the Amazons. And her fight is just beginning.

> "Diana is desperate to prove herself to her warrior sisters. But when the opportunity comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law to save a mere mortal, Alia Keralis. With this single heroic act, Diana may have just doomed the world. Alia is a Warbringer - a descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.

> "Diana and Alia will face an army of enemies, mortal and divine, determined to destroy or possess the Warbringer. To save the world, they must stand side by side against the tide of war."

I am a massive comic book fan, so I had high expectations for this book as it was a new take on Wonder Woman and the first of the new series (DC Icons) that match famous DC characters with YA authors. Luckily, it smashed every expectation I had.

I adored the way Bardugo blends mythology and the modern world, making Wonder Woman very relevant to her audience. The dual narration is excellent, as we really get to see the characters grow and it helps us understand their actions more.

The protagonists are strong but flawed teenage girls navigating a strange new world and I loved how as a reader, I could relate to an Amazonian!

As you would expect from a comic-book-inspired novel, it is action-packed, but that is secondary to the character growth of the protagonists. That was a refreshing change that I really enjoyed.

<cite>Wonder Woman: Warbringer</cite> is simply phenomenal and itâ€™s definitely one of my favourite books of 2017.
