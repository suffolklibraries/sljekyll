## [<cite>Floored: when seven lives collide</cite>, by Sara Barnard (ed.)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2395065)

Seven top UKYA authors write seven narrators in this collaboration.

## [<cite>Night Flights</cite>, by Philip Reeve](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2393768)

Three short stories set in the Mortal Engines universe.

> "In a dangerous future world where gigantic, motorised cities attack and devour each other, London hunts where no other predator dares. But Anna Fang - pilot, adventurer, spy - isn't afraid. These three stories show gripping, moving, exciting moments in Anna's life: her childhood as a slave aboard the moving city Arkangel, a showdown against a robotic Stalker that is terrifyingly out-of-control and her free life as an intelligence agent for the Anti-Traction league that might not be quite as free as she hoped."

## [<cite>Everything All At Once</cite>, by Steven Camden](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2394384)

> "Zooming in across our cast of characters, we share moments that span everything from hoping to make it to the end of the week, facing it, fitting in, finding friends and falling out, to loving lessons, losing it, and worrying, wearing it well and worshipping from afar. Steven Camden's poems speak to the kaleidoscope of teen experience and life at 'big school'."

## [<cite>Payback</cite>, by M. A. Griffin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2393828)

From the author of [<cite>Lifers</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1941612).

> "Payback has one mission: to steal from the rich and give to the poor. Its dramatic heists create a sensation. When Payback fan Tom is recruited, he accidentally brings with him a shady money man - who's not the only one on their tail. As the net closes in, the teenagers of Payback fight to stay alive. Being Robin Hood has never been this hard!"

## [<cite>A Sky Painted Gold</cite>, by Laura Wood](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392789)

> "Growing up in her sleepy Cornish village dreaming of being a writer, 16-year-old Lou has always wondered about the grand Cardew house which has stood empty for years. And when the owners arrive for the summer - a handsome, dashing brother and sister - Lou is quite swept off her feet and into a world of moonlit cocktail parties and glamour beyond her wildest dreams. But, as she grows closer to the Cardews, is she abandoning her own ambitions - and is there something darker lurking at the heart of the Cardew family?"

"Evokes a Gatsby-esque glamour with echoes of coming-of-age stories like <cite>I Capture the Castle</cite>" - <cite>The Bookseller</cite>

> "So when her school's super-exclusive secret society extends a mysterious invitation, Charlie's determination to get in is matched only by her conviction that she belongs there. But their secrets go deeper than she knows."

## [<cite>AWOL: Agent Without Licence</cite>, by Andrew Lane](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2394735)

> "Kieron and his friend Sam are shocked to see a man kidnapped in a Newcastle shopping centre right in front of their eyes. The boys quickly realise that the kidnapped man left something behind in the scuffle - an earpiece and glasses. Kieron puts them on and realises he can see not what is front of him, but a busy, tourist city, somewhere very hot - in Mumbai.

> "Kieron has accidentally stumbled upon the undercover world of Rebecca 'Bex' Wilson - a freelance agent working for the British Secret Intelligence Service. And without her handler Bradley (the man who was kidnapped), Bex is in trouble. She doesn't know who of her usual contacts she can trust, and like it or not, she is going to have to use teenage Kieron to get her out of danger. Before Kieron and Sam know it, they are part of a mission to stop a weapon of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands."

High octane action and adventure from the author of the Young Sherlock Holmes series. This should appeal to fans of James Bond and Alex Rider.

Embarrassed and annoyed, Hope is on a mission to get drunk, and with the alcohol flowing, Hope starts having a great time.
