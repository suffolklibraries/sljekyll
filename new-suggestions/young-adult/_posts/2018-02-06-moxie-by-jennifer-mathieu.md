> "Vivian Carter is fed up. Fed up with her high school teachers who think the football team can do no wrong. Fed up with sexist dress codes, hallway harassment and gross comments from guys during class. But most of all, Viv Carter is fed up with always following the rules.

> "Viv's mum was a tough-as-nails, punk rock Riot Grrrl in the '90s, and now Viv takes a page from her mother's past and creates Moxie, a feminist zine that she distributes anonymously to her classmates. She's just blowing off steam, but other girls respond and spread the Moxie message.

> "As Viv forges friendships with other young women across the divides of cliques and popularity rankings, she realises that what she has started is nothing short of a girl revolution."

<cite>Moxie</cite> is a powerful and brilliant book and real call to action, making it a must-read. It has such a good message of girl power and promotes the strength that comes from unity, especially in a particularly smart section about intersectionality.

It’s a gateway into feminism that is perfect for any teenagers fed up of the ‘banter’ that is frequently used to belittle and humiliate people. For me, it was a real eye-opener into different forms of protest and shows how feminism means something different to each person.

The characters are diverse, vivacious and whip-smart, and all of them develop over the course of the book. It is so refreshing to see diverse characters become more common in YA, though there is definitely a long way still to go.

<cite>Moxie</cite> is definitely one of the best books of last year. Remember, Moxie girls fight back!
