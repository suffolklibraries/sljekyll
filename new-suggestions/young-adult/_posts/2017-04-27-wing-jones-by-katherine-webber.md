**[See <cite>Wing Jones</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078815).**

Wing has always been in the shadow of her football-playing popular brother. She doesn't look like anyone else, and the one friend she did have moved away. When tragedy strikes the family, Wing discovers she can run - fast!

Wing finds a place to fit in, makes new friends, and Aaron becomes more than just her brother's best friend. Wing discovers against incredible pain you can find happiness - and her talent might just help her family too.

I loved <cite>Wing Jones</cite>, and I couldn't put it down. I will be keeping an eye out for anything else Katherine Webber writes. Read this book, it's one of my favourites so far this year!
