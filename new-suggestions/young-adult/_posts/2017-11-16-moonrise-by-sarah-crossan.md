> "Joe hasn't seen his brother for ten years, and it's for the most brutal of reasons. Ed is on death row. But now Ed's execution date has been set, and Joe is determined to spend those last weeks with him, no matter what other people think. What value do you place on life? What can you forgive? And just how do you say goodbye?"

This was a very powerful and moving book, told in Sarah Crossanâ€™s usual beautiful lyrical poetry that intertwines with the story. I loved how strong the characterisation was, despite it being told in short, sharp bursts.

This was a very challenging topic that Crossan dealt with well, leaving the details open to interpretation, adding to the poignant atmosphere. The way that the past and present was woven together was done very well; it really stuck with me.

<cite>Moonrise</cite> is a powerful, poignant story that will stay with you long after the final page.
