To mark LGBT History Month 2017, we've expanded our [list of LGBT books for children and young people from 2016](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/lgbt-history-month-for-young-people-in-2016/) to make a bumper list of recommended titles for young adults.

First published in 1985, this title has retained its relevance and fully deserves to be called a 'classic'.

## [<cite>Adaptation</cite>, by Malinda Lo](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1566985)

> "Flocks of birds are hurling themselves at aeroplanes across America. Thousands of people die. On Reese's long drive home, a bird flies into their headlights. The car flips over. When they wake up in a military hospital, the doctor won't tell them what happened. For Reese, though, this is just the start. She can't remember anything from the time between her accident and the day she woke up almost a month later. She only knows one thing: she's different now. Torn between longtime crush David and new girl Amber, the real question is: who can she trust?"

> "Reese and David are not normal teens - not since they were adapted with alien DNA by the Imria, an extraterrestrial race that has been secretly visiting Earth for decades.

Sequel to <cite>Adaptation</cite>.

## [<cite>Tony Hogan Bought Me an Ice Cream Float Before He Stole My Ma</cite>, by Kerry Hudson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=339563)

> "This is the story of a Scottish childhood of sordid council flats and B&Bs, screeching women, feckless men, fags and booze and drugs, the dole queue and bread and marge sandwiches. It is also the story of an irresistible, irrepressible heroine, a dysfunctional family you can't help but adore, and the absurdities of the 80s."

> "This bold, irreverent novel powerfully asks what if you weren't the 'chosen one'? The one who's supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death? What if you were like Mikey? Who just wants to graduate and go to prom and maybe finally work up the courage to ask Henna out before someone goes and blows up his high school. Again. Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this week's end of the world and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life. Even if your best friend might just be the God of mountain lions!"
