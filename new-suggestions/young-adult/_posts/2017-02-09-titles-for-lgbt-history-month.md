To mark LGBT History Month 2017, we've expanded our [list of LGBT books for children and young people from 2016](/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/2015-12-16-lgbt-history-month-for-young-people-in-2016/) to make a bumper list of recommended titles for young adults.

A lot of these books have come from [Juno Dawson's list of diverse YA books](http://www.junodawson.com/2015/06/28/yougotdiversebooks/).

## [<cite>Oranges are not the Only Fruit</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=253573)

> "Jeanette is adopted and brought up by her mother as one of God's elect. Zealous and passionate, she seems destined for life as a missionary, but then she falls for one of her converts. At sixteen, Jeanette decides to leave the church, her home and her family, for the young woman she loves."

First published in 1985, this title has retained its relevance and fully deserves to be called a 'classic'.

## [<cite>Ash</cite>, by Malinda Lo](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=332554)

> "With her parents both gone, Ash finds herself a servant in the house of her ruthless stepmother and there seems no hope of finding happiness again. But Ash is unaware of her mother's legacy, and that it will lead her to a magical place. A place where love, identity and belonging are all waiting."

## [<cite>Trumpet</cite>, by Jackie Kay](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=200552)

> "Joss Moody has died and the jazz world is in mourning. But in death, Joss can no longer guard the secret he kept all his life, and Colman, his son, must confront the truth: the man he believed to be his father was, in fact, a woman."

## [<cite>Girl Meets Boy</cite>, by Ali Smith](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=529720)

> "Girl meets boy. It's a story as old as time. But what happens when an old story meets a brand new set of circumstances?

> "Ali Smith's re-mix of Ovid's most joyful metamorphosis is a story about the kind of fluidity that can't be bottled and sold.

> "It is about girls and boys, girls and girls, love and transformation, a story of puns and doubles, reversals and revelations."

## [<cite>Tony Hogan Bought Me an Ice Cream Float Before He Stole My Ma</cite>, by Kerry Hudson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=339563)

> "This is the story of a Scottish childhood of sordid council flats and B&Bs, screeching women, feckless men, fags and booze and drugs, the dole queue and bread and marge sandwiches. It is also the story of an irresistible, irrepressible heroine, a dysfunctional family you can't help but adore, and the absurdities of the 80s."

## [<cite>George</cite>, by Alex Gino](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1819835)

> "A bright, bold debut about a girl who happens to have been born a boy but refuses to let that stand in the way of her dream, <cite>George</cite> is a pertinent and poignant middle-grade read for kids of all backgrounds."

## [<cite>Beautiful Music for Ugly Children</cite>, by Kirstin Cronn-Mills](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1286511)

> "Gabe has always identified as a boy, but he was born with a girl's body. With his new public access radio show gaining in popularity, Gabe struggles with romance, friendships, and parents - all while trying to come out as transgendered. An audition for a station in Minneapolis looks like his ticket to a better life in the big city. But his entire future is threatened when several violent guys find out Gabe the popular DJ is also Elizabeth from school."

## [<cite>Golden Boy</cite>, by Abigail Tarttelin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1508944)

> "Max Walker is the golden boy. He's the perfect son, the perfect friend and the perfect crush for the girls at his school. He's attractive, he's intelligent, he's athletic. He's even nice to his little brother. But he has a terrible secret. If his secret gets out, his perfect life will be blown apart."

## [<cite>What We Left Behind</cite>, by Robin Talley](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1857759)

> "What if discovering who you really are means letting go of who you've been? Toni and Gretchen are the couple everyone envied in high school. They've been together forever. They never fight. They're hopelessly in love. When they separate for their first year at college they're sure their relationship will stay rock solid.

> "The reality of being apart, however, is very different. Toni's discovering a new world - and a new gender identity - but Gretchen struggles to remember who she is outside of their relationship. While Toni worries that she won't understand Toni's shifting identity, Gretchen begins to wonder where she fits in to this puzzle. Now they must decide if their love is strong enough to last."

## [<cite>If I Was Your Girl</cite>, by Meredith Russo](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1977504)

> "My name is Amanda. I'm 18. When you look at me, you might see that I'm pretty and popular, you might think my life is easy. But being me has never been easy - because I haven't always been Amanda. When I was born, I was named Andrew. Now, at my new school, I finally feel like myself. But do I owe my new friends the truth about my past?"
