> "But Frey is weary of the death trade and dreams of a life bigger than the one she's been dealt. So when she hears of an unstoppable monster slaughtering men, women, and children in a nearby town, she decides this is the Mercies' one chance out. The fame and fortune of bringing down such a beast would ensure a new future, far from the death trade, for all the Mercies.

> "But Frey soon learns the real meaning of sacrifice, and the cost of guts and glory. Her actions may change the fate of girls in the world forever."

**And some classics...**

## [<cite>Frankenstein</cite>, by Mary Wollstonecraft](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1615550)

> "Victor Frankenstein, a Swiss scientist, has a great ambition: to create intelligent life. But when his creature first stirs, he realises he has made a monster. A monster which, abandoned by his master and shunned by everyone who sees it, follows Dr Frankenstein with murder and horrors to the very ends of the earth."

## [<cite>Dracula</cite>, by Bram Stoker](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1615549)

> "Beware Count Dracula. He has been dead for centuries, yet still he walks the Earth. His Transylvanian castle is a dark and mysterious place, where terror is constant and survival is rare. Visitors are always welcome, to a fate worse than death."

## [<cite>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde and other tales</cite>, by Robert Louis Stevenson & Roger Luckhurst](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=162894)

> "This dark psychological fantasy is more than a moral tale. It is also a product of its time, drawing on contemporary theories of class, evolution and criminality and the secret lives behind Victorian propriety, to create a unique form of urban Gothic."

## [<cite>The Island of Doctor Moreau</cite>, by H. G. Wells](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=68652)

> "Prendick, a naturalist, is shipwrecked on the island retreat of notorious vivisector, Dr Moreau. In a laboratory called the House of Pain, Moreau manufactures 'humanised' animals known as the Beast People, whom he controls through fear - until the terrifying day when one of his degraded victims turns against him."
