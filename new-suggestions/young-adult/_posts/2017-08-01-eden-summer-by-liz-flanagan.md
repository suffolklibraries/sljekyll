**[See <cite>Eden Summer</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1996595).**

When Eden goes missing from her Yorkshire town, her best friend Jess starts to think that she may not know everything about Eden. As Jess beings to piece together the reasons for Eden’s disappearance, she starts to question her memories of the last summer and what really happened.

I really liked this book. I found it easy to picture the two main characters, Jess and Eden, because they were described so well that I could really connect with and understand how they were feeling. By telling the story from the perspective of Jess rather than Eden, the author showed how much Jess cared about Eden, which I really enjoyed.

I liked the fact that as the book progresses, not only Jess but also the reader becomes aware that the summer wasn’t as good as it had originally seemed. The use of flashbacks was a good way to help the reader piece more of the story together.

This book kept me intrigued right up until the end and I would definitely recommend it as it shows the value of a true friendship.
