Louise O’Neill has truly established herself as a firecracker author whose prose cuts as sharply and precisely as a knife. <cite>The Surface Breaks</cite> just continues her dark, feminist brand of YA.

This is <cite>The Little Mermaid</cite> retold for teens today: fierce, awesome and empowering. It rips apart so many ideas from the beauty myth to the silencing of women. Also, the cover is one of the most gorgeous ones I’ve seen this year.
