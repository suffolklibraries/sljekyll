This is definitely a book you want to go into without knowing much, so I’ll keep this brief. <cite>Warcross</cite> is a fantastic book that is packed full of memorable characters and casual diversity. The issues that are handled are very timely and relevant to a teenage audience. Moreover, the actual game of <cite>Warcross</cite> seemed awesome and I really wanted to play it.

If you haven’t heard of Marie Lu before, her Legend series and recent [Batman adaptation](/new-suggestions/young-adult/batman-nightwalker-by-marie-lu/) are definitely worth a read if you enjoy YA with a twist.

<cite>Warcross</cite> is a fast-paced, thrilling discussion of complex moral issues and a brilliant set up for a series to watch.
