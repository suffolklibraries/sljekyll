> "Ellie Frias disappeared long before she vanished. Tormented throughout middle school, she begins her freshman year with new clothes, new hair, and a plan: she doesn't need to be popular, she just needs to blend in with the wallpaper. It's a lonely existence, but at least no one's tripping her in the halls.

> "In fact, no one notices her at all. Until Caleb Breward, tells her she's beautiful and makes her believe it. Ellie loves Caleb, but sometimes she doesn't like him that much - his awkward smile, the possessive way he touches her, the tone he uses, how he ignores her one minute and can't get enough the next. And on one black night, she discovers the monster her boyfriend really is.

> "Ellie wasn't the first victim, but now, trapped, she has to watch it happen again and again. She tries to hold onto her happier memories in order to get past the cold days, waiting for someone to find her."

<cite>I Stop Somewhere</cite> should be essential reading for older teenage readers. It is a bleak but enthralling exploration of a culture where rape and violence against women are normalised, so itâ€™s incredibly dark but powerful.

I devoured this book in one sitting. Carter has created a protagonist with a distinctive and devastating voice that will stay with you for ages.

<cite>I Stop Somewhere</cite> is dark and at times hard to read, but fantastic and completely necessary.
