> "In this novel, the world of Moby Dick is turned upside down, and we see the story through the eyes of the whale.

But is he really the devil that Bathsheba seeks?"

Publisher HarperCollins says: 'Patrick Ness turns the familiar tale of <cite>Moby Dick</cite> upside down and tells a story all its own with epic triumph and devastating fate.'

They are preparing for the final battle and it’s Jeet’s task to record the events.

Killer T is a synthetic virus with a ninety per-cent mortality rate, and the terrorists who created it want a billion dollars before they'll release a vaccine."

> "When Rona Blackburn landed on Anathema Island more than a century ago, her otherworldly skills might have benefited friendlier neighbours. Instead, guilt and fear led the island's original eight settlers to burn 'the witch' out of her home. So Rona invoked the privileges of a witch; she cursed them.

> "But such a spell always comes with a terrible price, and in punishing the island's residents, Rona also bound her family ever tighter to them. Fast-forward to the present day and all Nor Blackburn wants is to live an unremarkable teenage life. And she has reason to hope that she may have escaped the thorny side-effects of the family matriach's curse.

> "But then a mysterious book comes out, promising to cast any spell for the right price. The author - Nor's own mother - seems capable of performing magic that should be far beyond her capabilities. And such magic always requires a sacrifice. A storm is coming."

American magazine <cite>Kirkus Reviews</cite> calls this 'an atmospheric, blood-drenched dark fantasy for a cold and stormy night.'

## [<cite>Rosie Loves Jack</cite>, by Mel Darbon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2424937)

> "Rosie loves Jack. Jack loves Rosie. So when they're split up, Rosie will do anything to find the boy who makes the sun shine in her head. Even run away from home. Even cross London and travel to Brighton alone, though the trains are cancelled and the snow is falling. Even though any girl might find that hard, let alone a girl with Down's syndrome."

## [<cite>It Ends With You</cite>, by S. K. Wright](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2425629)

> "Everyone loves Eva. Beautiful, bright, fun, generous - she's perfect. So when her dead body is found in a ditch in the local woods the only thing anyone wants to know is: Who could have done this? It has to be Luke, her boyfriend. He has the motive, the means, the opportunity and he's no stranger to the police. Even though the picture is incomplete, the pieces fit. But as time passes, stories change.

> "Told from six narrative strands, this cleverly woven and utterly compulsive novel challenges preconceptions; makes you second, third and fourth guess yourself; and holds an uncomfortable mirror up to the way societies and systems treat those they perceive to be on the outside."

Publisher Little, Brown calls this 'a chilling modern thriller for fans of E. Lockhart, [<cite>One Of Us Is Lying</cite>](/new-suggestions/young-adult/one-of-us-is-lying-by-karen-m-mcmanus/) and [<cite>13 Reasons Why</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2147327).'
