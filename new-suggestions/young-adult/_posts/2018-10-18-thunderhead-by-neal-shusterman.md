> "It's been a year since Rowan went off-grid. Hunted by the Scythedom, he has become an urban legend, a vigilante snuffing out corrupt scythes in a trial by fire. Citra, meanwhile, is forging her path as Scythe Anastasia, gleaning with compassion. However, conflict within the Scythedom is growing by the day, and when Citra's life is threatened, it becomes clear that there is a truly terrifying plot afoot.

> "The Thunderhead observes everything, and it does not like what it sees. Will it intervene? Or will it simply watch as this perfect world begins to unravel?"

<cite>Thunderhead</cite> has confirmed what I already thought; I am obsessed with the [<cite>Scythe</cite>](/new-suggestions/young-adult/scythe-by-neal-shusterman/) series.

Shusterman's amazingly clever and original concept has spawned a wonderfully crafted series. Every detail intrigues me more and I honestly feel like I could read about this world forever.

The ending is shocking and brilliant, and leaves you with so many questions. It’s the perfect addition to a book that’s jam-packed with so many twists and turns.

<cite>Thunderhead</cite> is a phenomenal and gripping addition to a series that’s quickly becoming one of my favourites.
