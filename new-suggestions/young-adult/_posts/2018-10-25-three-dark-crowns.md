> "In every generation on the island of Fennbirn, a set of triplets is born: three queens, all equal heirs to the crown and each possessor of a coveted magic. Mirabella is a fierce elemental, able to spark hungry flames or vicious storms at the snap of her fingers. Katharine is a poisoner, one who can ingest the deadliest poisons without so much as a stomach ache. Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions.

> "But becoming the Queen Crowned isn't solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And it's not just a game of win or lose - it's life or death. The night the sisters turn sixteen, the battle begins. The last queen standing gets the crown."

<cite>Three Dark Crowns</cite> is a deliciously dark, incredibly compelling and gripping story. I couldn’t help but root for every one of the sisters by reading their different perspectives. The political intrigue was just great, with all the different interactions between characters and the fiendish plots that were formed. It left me on tenterhooks and I couldn’t put the book down.

I physically need to read more from Fennbirn and I can’t wait to see what happens next for the three Queens and my personal favourite character, Jules. This is another series I’m definitely obsessed with.
