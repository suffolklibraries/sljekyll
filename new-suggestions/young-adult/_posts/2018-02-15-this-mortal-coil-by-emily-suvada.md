> "When a lone soldier, Cole, arrives with news of Lachlan Agatta's death, all hope seems lost for Catarina. Her father was the world's leading geneticist, and humanity's best hope of beating a devastating virus.

> "Then, hidden beneath Cole's genehacked enhancements she finds a message of hope: Lachlan created a vaccine. Only she can find and decrypt it, if she can unravel the clues he left for her. The closer she gets, the more she finds herself at risk from Cartaxus, a shadowy organization with a stranglehold on the world's genetic tech.

> "But it's too late to turn back. As the pieces fit together it's clear there is one final secret that Cat must unlock. A secret that will change everything."

In <cite>This Mortal Coil</cite>, teenager Cat faces a race against time to discover the vaccine for a virus called Hydra. It spreads through the air when those infected with it explode. Meanwhile mindless, cannibalistic humans called 'Lurkers' maintain their immunity to the disease by eating victims' flesh. The whole of humanity is in danger of extinction.

I really loved this book, especially because I am a fan of science and thrilling moments. The number of plot twists is incredible - it is amazing how just by turning a page, the whole story turns on itself and is completely different! This makes this an absolutely brilliant book.

I also loved the message at the heart of <cite>This Mortal Coil</cite>: that we are more than our genes dictate. We are not always who we think we are and we can be whoever we want to be when we try.
