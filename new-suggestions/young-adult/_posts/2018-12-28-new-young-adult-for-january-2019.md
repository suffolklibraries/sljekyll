## [<cite>The Twisted Tree</cite>, by Rachel Burge](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2486161)

Nordic chiller rooted in Scandinavian mythology.

> "Martha can tell things about a person just by touching their clothes, as if their emotions and memories have been absorbed into the material. It started the day she fell from the tree at her grandma's cabin and became blind in one eye.

> "Determined to understand her strange ability, Martha sets off to visit her grandmother, Mormor - only to discover Mormor is dead, a peculiar boy is in her cabin and a terrifying creature is on the loose. Then the spinning wheel starts creaking, books move around and terror creeps in."

## [<cite>The Curses</cite>, by Laure Eve](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2197312)

Sequel to the YA Book Prize-shortlisted [<cite>The Graces</cite>](/new-suggestions/young-adult/the-graces-by-laure-eve/).

> "Summer Grace has had enough of secrets. They've been tearing her family apart for generations, and one in particular caused the death of her best friend, Wolf.

> "But now Wolf is back. Supposedly returned from having run away - though Summer knows that's not what happened. He was resurrected, brought back to life by her ex-best friend - an ex-best friend who is now swearing revenge on her family. And her family won't believe that whatever this thing is, it's not Wolf. He's dangerous, and Summer is desperate - so desperate that she might just be forced to turn to the one friend she never thought she'd turn to again. Because something is stirring - something so powerful that even the Graces will fear it."

## [<cite>Lark</cite>, by Anthony McGowan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2492485)

Conclusion of the quartet which began with [<cite>Brock</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1377087), [<cite>Pike</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1752341) and the Carnegie-shortlisted [<cite>Rook</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2153898). All four stories have been collected together as [<cite>The Truth of Things</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2493021).

> "Things are tense at home for Nicky and Kenny. Their mum's coming to visit and it will be the first time they've seen her in years. A lot has changed since they were little and Nicky's not so sure he's ready to see her again.

> "When they head for a trek across the moors to take their minds off everything, a series of unforeseen circumstances leaves the brothers in a vulnerable and very dangerous position. There might even be a chance that this time not everyone will make it home alive..."

## [<cite>Paper Avalanche</cite>, by Lisa Williamson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2395747)

> "Ro Snow is the girl no-one notices - she doesn't go to parties and she doesn't have friends over. Besides, even if anyone tried to call on her they'd discover that no. 56 isn't her house at all - it's her decoy house, where she tells people to pick her up and drop her off so she can hide who she really is and where she really lives. And she certainly doesn't have a best friend because having friends means opening up, telling the truth and there is one secret she can never risk revealing again.

>" But when Tanvi turns up, Ro starts to put other things before her secret first - like her love of singing, her crush on good looking and popular Luke, her budding friendship with the adorable Tanvi - and it's only a matter of time before everything comes out and everything changes!"

> "Fall in love, break the curse. It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.

> "Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she's instead somehow sucked into Rhen's cursed world. Break the curse, save the kingdom."

Where a Homecoming Queen's murder five years ago made national news. And where Ellery now has to live with a grandmother she barely knows, after her failed-actress mother lands in rehab. No one knows what happened to either girl, and Ellery's family is still haunted by their loss.

> "Malcolm grew up in the shadow of the Homecoming Queen's death. His older brother was the prime suspect and left Echo Ridge in disgrace.

No one has forgotten Malcolm's brother - and nobody trusts him when he suddenly returns to town."
