> "Sarah has played many roles. Dutiful daughter. Talented gymnast. Persecuted Jew. Lost orphan. But now she faces her most challenging role of all. Now she must become the very thing she hates. For the only way she can survive as a spy at a boarding school for the cream of Nazi society is to become a monster like them. A monster who can destroy them."

To keep in with the mysterious nature of this book, I won’t give much away. All I will say is <cite>Orphan Monster Spy</cite> is completely engrossing, slick and stylish.

Sarah bursts off the page with her fearless and determined attitude. Also, the cover is absolutely stunning and gave me strong Gatsby vibes with its Art Deco style.

<cite>Orphan Monster Spy</cite> is a gripping, fast-paced novel that introduces a brilliant main character that I can’t wait to see more of.
