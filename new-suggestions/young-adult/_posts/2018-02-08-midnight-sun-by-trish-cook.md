> "Katie can't leave her house during the day: she has a rare disease that makes even the smallest amount of sunlight deadly. But everything changes when one evening, singing her heart out on a deserted station platform, she meets Charlie.

> "Before the night is out, Katie is smitten. But she hasn't told Charlie her secret. She just wants to have her normal love story, before reality kicks in. Lost in her night-time summer romance, Katie knows that love will light the way."

<cite>Midnight Sun</cite> definitely has vibes of John Green's [<cite>The Fault in our Stars</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1555738) about it. It is heartbreaking and wonderful, with the message ‘love conquers all’. This is due to become a movie in 2018 and I look forward to seeing it on the big screen.

If you love a girl meets boy story, give this book a read.
