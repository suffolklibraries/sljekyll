> "Olivia Mead is a headstrong, independent girl — a suffragist — in an age that prefers its girls to be docile.

> "It’s 1900 in Oregon, and Olivia’s father, concerned that she’s headed for trouble, convinces a stage mesmerist to try to hypnotize the rebellion out of her. But the hypnotist, an intriguing young man named Henri Reverie, gives her a terrible gift instead: she’s able to see people’s true natures, manifesting as visions of darkness and goodness, while also unable to speak her true thoughts out loud.

> "These supernatural challenges only make Olivia more determined to speak her mind, and so she’s drawn into a dangerous relationship with the hypnotist and his mysterious motives, all while secretly fighting for the rights of women."

If you have an interest in suffrage, equality, hypnotism or even Dracula, I urge you to read <cite>The Cure for Dreaming</cite>. I was transported to the dark side of Victorian Oregon. I felt as though I was with Olivia in her relationships with Henri/Henry and her father and so wanted her to escape to a better life. You’ll have to read it to find out if she does!

I really liked this book. It was completely not what I would normally go for, but I’m so glad I read it. I will definitely be giving Cat Winters' other books a read!
