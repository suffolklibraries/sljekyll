**[See <cite>One of Us is Lying</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2163913)**

On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention. Bronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing. Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher. And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.

These five strangers walk in, but only four come out alive. All of them have something to hide, but how far have they gone to protect it?

<cite>One of Us Is Lying</cite> is a perfect teen thriller; it has enough tension and drama to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it also features some brilliant character developments. All of the students grow beyond their respective stereotypes, creating a diverse cast of characters who are funny and smart. However, you can never quite trust everything they say and McManus’ writing keeps you guessing until the last page.

When I found out the premise of the book, I was instantly reminded of <cite>The Breakfast Club</cite>. Now that I’ve read it, it is like <cite>The Breakfast Club</cite> mixed with <cite>Pretty Little Liars</cite> with a healthy dash of murder.

I loved how each character narrates chapters from their perspective, as it gives you a lot more insight into their motivations and personalities. For me, this only added to the intrigue as I wanted to find out all their secrets.

Prepare to get sucked into a tangled web of secrets, lies and betrayal in this gripping debut novel.
