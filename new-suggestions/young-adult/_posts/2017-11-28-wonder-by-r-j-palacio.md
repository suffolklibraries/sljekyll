> "My name is August. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."

August Pullman is about to start fifth grade at school. Tough enough, but he has never been to school before. Until now, he has been homeschooled by his mum because he was born with a facial defect which makes people stare at him all the time. At school, he has trouble finding out who his friends are, between those who are feeling sorry and take pity on him. It is when he is truly vulnerable that he does find out.

I read this book in two days. If I could, I would have read it in one sitting. A lot of people had told me I needed to read this book and I can't thank them enough. This book is a 'Wonder'. It made me smile, laugh, feel sad and well up.

<cite>Wonder</cite> has an important message: being kind will always win the day and when it really comes to it, in your most darkest moments, the people you can truly depend on will be there for you. I would recommend this book to anyone.
