> "Zoe Bird is a lonely, disaffected teen growing up in rural Canada and going nowhere fast. Her only true friend is her granny, but now her Alzheimer's is worsening, Zoe's parents want to put her in a home. Zoe decides now is the time to break free. She decides to take her granny on a trip to find her estranged uncle. But what Zoe will find when they get there will shake her to her very core."

<cite>The Way Back Home</cite> is a quick read that covers so many topics - family dysfunction, bullying, discrimination, LGBT issues and bereavement - that you are sure to relate to one of the characters. I loved the character of Zoe and the love she has for her granny who is suffering from Alzheimer's.
