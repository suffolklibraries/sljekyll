Life is a circus. Donâ€™t miss the show.

Twins Finch & Birdie Franconi are flying trapeze artists in the family run circus. After Birdie has an accident, Finch has to become partners with Hector the new boy and try to help save the circus from financial ruin.

This is a story about friendship, first love in all its forms, trust and family relationships.

The title on its own pulled me towards this book. The fact it is about the circus further enticed me. I knew from the first few pages I would love it, and I did. The relationship Finch has with Birdie and then Hector kept me compelled all the way through. I was rooting for both relationships from the very beginning.

The uncertainty you feel at high school and the pressure to conform with rather than stand out from your peers were well-highlighted. The bravery it takes to stand up for what you believe and to let people know who you truly are also came across very well.

<cite>Flying Tips for Flightless Birds</cite> is definitely one of my favourite books of 2018 so far. It reminded me of [<cite>Wing Jones</cite> by Katherine Webber](/new-suggestions/young-adult/wing-jones-by-katherine-webber/); if you have read one of these books you will certainly like the other. Reserve them both now and enjoy!
