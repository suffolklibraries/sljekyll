Emily is bored of her suburban life in Cherry Grove. Things are starting to change with her current best friend since she got a boyfriend. When she is given the chance of a place on an art programme in Philadelphia Emily can't wait to get away from her current life.

One she starts the summer programme at Philadelphia College of Fine Art, Emily  struggles to find where she fits in. She meets the alluring Yates and the mysterious Fiona. Emily can feel her identity changing, but what is she going to lose and gain along the way?

I liked this book. It didn't take me long to read and I wanted to see where Emily's journey would lead her. This is the perfect book if you are trying to find your place in the world & you are asking the question 'who am I'?
