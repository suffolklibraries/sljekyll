The Loneliest Girl in the Universe is definitely what you would call lonely â€“ Romy Silvers is the only surviving person on board The Infinity. Her parents both died on board, leaving her heading towards a new, unexplored planet by herself. The only person she is able to contact, by voice message, is her counsellor back on Earth. Until one day, a new rocket ship is launched, bringing with it another person...

J is thoughtful, kind, caring, understanding - everything you could want in a boy! Romy finally thinks that when the two ships meet up, they will be more than just "pen-pals". However, when J does arrive, Romy realises there are worse things out there than being alone, and she won't always be protected by her spaceship.

<cite>The Loneliest Girl in the Universe</cite> is an enthralling book and I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of romance, sci-fi, adventure and heart-stopping moments.
