> "Astor, Ontario, 1904. A boy staggers out of the forest covered in blood and collapses at the feet of 16-year-old Emmy. While others are suspicious and afraid, Emmy is drawn to him. Is he really the monster the townsfolk say he is?

> "Astor, Ontario, 1994. Megan arrives from London for her great grandmother Emmy's 105th birthday. It should be a happy family occasion, but Megan is nursing a broken heart and carrying a secret she fears might consume her."

<cite>Stranger</cite> is a beautiful book which pieces together the connected stories from 1904 and 1994 all the way through. It is written in such a way that you can really empathise with the characters, even if you have nothing in common with them.

 Keren David has written a really enjoyable, suspenseful story that kept me hooked literally until the last page!
