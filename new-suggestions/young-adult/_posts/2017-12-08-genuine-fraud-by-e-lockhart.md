> "Imogen is a runaway heiress, an orphan, a cook and a cheat. Jule is a fighter, a social chameleon and an athlete.

> "An intense friendship. A disappearance. A murder, or maybe two. A bad romance, or maybe three. Blunt objects, disguises, blood and chocolate. The American dream, superheroes, spies and villains. A girl who refuses to give people what they want from her. A girl who refuses to be the person she once was."

<cite>Genuine Fraud</cite> is full of female empowerment and really smart insights into society. It also challenges your viewpoint on some things, especially later in the book.

It took me a while to get used to Lockhart's writing style, but I really enjoyed the book once I got into it. I loved how unreliable the narrator was and how you had to interpret details yourself to fully 'get' the story.

This is a great book, full of twists and turns.
