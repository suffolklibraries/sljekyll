> "Even among the many unusual members of the travelling circus that has always been her home, 16-year-old Sorina stands apart as the only illusion-worker born in hundreds of years. This rare talent allows her to create illusions that others can see, feel and touch, with personalities all of their own. Her creations are her family, and together they make up the cast of the festival's freak show.

> "But no matter how lifelike they may seem, her illusions are still just that - illusions, and not truly real. Or so she always believed - until one of them is murdered. Now she must unravel the horrifying truth before all her loved ones disappear."

I completely adored <cite>Daughter of the Burning City</cite>.

Every character leaps off the page. They are so engaging and Sorina’s family of illusions really feel like they could live down the street. They made it impossible to put the book down.

The plot is simply spellbinding. It’s everything you could want from a YA thriller: gripping plot, shocking twists and nail-bitingly tense scenes. You can never really tell who you can trust, which is just how I like my mysteries.

Foody weaves a brilliant world, expertly blending the futuristic time period and the vaguely creepy, magical atmosphere of the circus. I could happily read further books set in this universe, but the plot is wrapped up so well that another book may ruin it.

<cite>Daughter of the Burning City</cite> is an awe-inspiring and thrilling dark fantasy from a bold new voice in YA. What more could you ask for?
