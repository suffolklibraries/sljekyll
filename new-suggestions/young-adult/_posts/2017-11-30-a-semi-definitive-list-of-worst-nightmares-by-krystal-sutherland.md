> "Esther Solar's family is unusual. Her father hasn't left the basement in 6 years. Her brother is terrified of darkness. Esther isn't afraid of anything, a feat she achieves by avoiding pretty much everything. Elevators are off limits, as are open spaces, crowds, family pets, birds, needles, haircuts, dolls and mirrors.

> "Then Esther is mugged by her old classmate, Jonah Walker. Jonah is just as she remembers him: rude, cocky and from a broken family. He's also utterly fearless. Jonah's theft brings their lives crashing back together, and Esther and Jonah become surprising friends. Jonah sets a challenge: every week they must work their way through the world's 50 most common phobias."
