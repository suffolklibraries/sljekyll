> "Meet the patients of the Clarity Centre: Kendall, the trans anorexic model-wannabe, Vicodin addict Saif, OCD hoarder Guy, over-eater Ruby, washed-up reality TV survivor Brady, and last but definitely not least, spoiled heiress Lexi Volkov.

> "Lexi hit rock bottom. After almost overdosing in a penthouse suite her brother stages an intervention and takes her to the Clarity facility for troubled young people. After a gruelling and painful detox, Lexi enters group therapy and meets her fellow 'inmates'. Through her therapy sessions and a ten step programme, Lexi gradually opens up about her destructive life."

<cite>Clean</cite> is a raw, powerful and gritty story. It’s intoxicating and addictive with brilliantly casual diversity.

Lexi is one of the boldest, most interesting protagonists I’ve seen for a long time. She will stay with you long after the final page. Her voice just captivates you and makes this such a quick and enjoyable read. Trust me, you won’t be able to put it down.

The representation from the other characters is just an added bonus and every single person is well-developed and allowed to grow.

<cite>Clean</cite> is easily one of the best YA books I’ve read this year. This dark, compelling story is essential reading for any fans of YA.
