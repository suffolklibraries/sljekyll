> "Two years after a downward spiral took her as low as you can possibly go, Suzanne is starting again. Again. She's back in Brighton, the only place she felt she belonged, back with her best friends Caddy and Rosie. But they're about to leave for university.

> "When your friends have been your light in the darkness, what happens when you're the one left behind?"

I utterly loved reading <cite>Fierce Fragile Hearts</cite> because main character Suzanne has such a memorable and brilliant voice, and is allowed to be fragile and vulnerable, allowing room for growth and development. In fact, the beauty of Sara Barnard's writing is that all of her characters are flawed and relatable, and Suzanne is definitely no exception.

Suzanne's fragility lets Barnard have a frank and raw discussion of mental health and the rocky road of recovery. This story tackles some heavy issues, but with respect and clear consideration. It can be intense and dark, so I would only encourage older readers to pick this up, as it tackles abuse, depression and PTSD and refers to suicide.

<cite>Fierce Fragile Hearts</cite> is a heartbreaking and utterly beautiful story that I will treasure for a long time.
