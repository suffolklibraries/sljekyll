> "Izzy O'Neill here! Impoverished orphan, aspiring comedian and Slut Extraordinaire, if the gossip sites are anything to go by.

> "Izzy never expected to be 18 and internationally reviled. But when explicit photos involving her, a politician's son and a garden bench are published online, the trolls set out to take her apart. Armed with best friend Ajita and a metric ton of nachos, she tries to laugh it off - but as the daily slut-shaming intensifies, she soon learns the way the world treats teenage girls is not okay."

<cite>The Exact Opposite of Okay</cite> is a brilliant book. Laura Steven's writing is a perfect blend of Holly Bourne’s humour and Louise O’Neill's sharp insight.

Izzy is such a bold character: funny, fierce and fabulous, but also vulnerable. Her best friend Ajita is awesome and I’d love to see a spin-off book about her. The sarcastic, dry wit the teenage characters used throughout the book was very realistic!

Steven covers so many topics from sexuality and sex shaming to ‘nice guys’ and the ‘friend zone’. Introducing teenage readers to these feminist topics is so important and long may this new wave of feminist YA continue.
