> "From the author of <cite>Moxie</cite> comes a startling book about stereotypes, slut shaming and the battle for popularity. In this remarkable novel, four Healy High students - the party girl, the car accident survivor, the ex best friend and the boy next door - tell all they know. But exactly what is the truth about Alice? In the end there's only one person to ask: Alice herself."

Jennifer Mathieu is quickly making a name for herself within YA as a feminist voice to be reckoned with. <cite>The Truth About Alice</cite> is another smash-hit that deals with toxic masculinity and slut-shaming in an accessible and powerful way.

Mathieu's use of multiple perspectives took me on an emotional rollercoaster that made me unable to put the book down.

<cite>The Truth About Alice</cite> is a short and punchy burst of brilliant feminist YA that every teenager should read.
