**[See <cite>Murder in Midwinter</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2037898).**

Maya is travelling on a bus in Central London trying to take photos on her phone of the beautifully festive shop windows when a couple step into her viewfinder and start arguing. Through the camera flashes as Maya clicks away trying to get a decent photo for her sister, a glint of something else catches her eyes. The man has a gun. As Maya's flash releases, the man disappears. But not before he's seen her.

Then a dead body appears and all hell breaks loose. The police send Maya into hiding in rural Wales. She resolves to get to the bottom of the mystery. Then the snow comes and no one can get out. But what if someone can still get in?

Fleur Hitchcock is back with an atmospheric, wintry rollercoaster ride of a novel that throws you into a world of snow, sinister characters and spine-tingling moments of suspense.

The main character, Maya, is a fierce, funny and fearless heroine that stands out from the crowd. Hitchcock has created a great protagonist with an authentic, engaging and thoroughly enjoyable narrative. It’s the attention to little details, like Maya’s aunt repeatedly forgetting that Maya is a vegetarian, that just add a touch of humour to this taut murder mystery.

Throughout the book there are twists and turns that leave you guessing until the very last chapters.

I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to pre-teens who are looking for a taste of mystery and suspense.
