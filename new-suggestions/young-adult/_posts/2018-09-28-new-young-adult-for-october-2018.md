In the conclusion to the Throne of Glass fantasy series:

Also left to forge their own paths in order to change history are Chaol, the witch Manon, and the golden boy Dorian - while Aelin's mate, the fae male Rowan, searches the world over for his lost love.

> "As Aelin gathers the strength to save herself and fight the ultimate battle of her life, all of their destinies hang in the balance."

Third instalment in the Three Dark Crowns quartet.

> "The battle has been fought, blood has been spilt and a queen has been crowned, but not all are happy with the outcome. Katharine, the poisoner queen, has been crowned and is trying to ignore the whispers that call her illegitimate, undead, cursed. Mirabella and Arsinoe have escaped the island of Fennbirn, but how long before the island calls them back? Jules is returning to Fennbirn and has become the unlikely figurehead of a revolution threatening to topple Katharine's already unsteady rule. But what good is a revolution if something is wrong with the island itself?"

> "When a letter that was never meant to be seen by anyone draws high school senior Evan Hansen into a family's grief over the loss of their son, he is given the chance of a lifetime: to belong. He just has to stick to a lie he never meant to tell, that the notoriously troubled Connor Murphy was his secret best friend.

> "Suddenly, Evan isn't invisible anymore. And Connor's parents, with their beautiful home on the other side of town, have taken him in like he was their own, desperate to know more about their enigmatic son from his 'closest friend'. As Evan gets pulled deeper into their family, he knows that what he's doing can't be right, but if he's helping people, how wrong can it be?

> "No longer tangled in his once-incapacitating anxiety, this new Evan has a purpose. He's confident. He's a viral phenomenon. Until everything is in danger of unravelling and he comes face to face with his greatest obstacle: himself."

> "But carefree days of beach visits and normalling lessons are soon interrupted by a discovery - a subterranean bunker that belonged to Jacob's grandfather, Abe. Clues to Abe's double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he has inherited - truths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine's time loop.

> "Now, the stakes are higher than ever as Jacob and his friends are thrust into the untamed landscape of American peculiardom - a world with few ymbrynes, or rules - that none of them understand."

> "But a relationship with the girl next door isn't on the cards because Jupiter has been out of the closet for almost as long as she's known Courtney. Then Rae Chin moves to town, and Courtney thinks he's finally found a girl he could fall for who isn't Jupiter. The only problem: Jupiter is falling for Rae, too."

So when she hears of an unstoppable monster slaughtering men, women, and children in a nearby town, she decides this is the Mercies' one chance out.

> "The drought - or the Tap-Out, as everyone calls it - has been going on for a while now. Everyone's lives have become an endless list of don'ts: don't water the lawn, don't fill up your pool, don't take long showers. Until the taps run dry.

> "Suddenly, Alyssa's quiet suburban street spirals into a warzone of desperation; neighbours and families turned against each other on the hunt for water. And when her parents don't return and her life - and the life of her brother - is threatened, Alyssa has to make impossible choices if she's going to survive."

> "But what starts as a bit of fun to rile the cyber snoops soon spirals out of control. Revenge on Jordan's bullies could be classed as bullying itself. At best, Eli's school career is in jeopardy, at worst, once more lives are at risk."
