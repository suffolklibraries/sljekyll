**[See <cite>Goose</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1577945).**

<cite>Goose</cite> is the sequel to [<cite>Paper Aeroplanes</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1384858), in which confident and eccentric Renée and shy and retiring Flo form an unlikely close friendship after an event brings them together.

In <cite>Goose</cite>, we pick up with the friends who are now studying their A levels at the local grammar school. Flo is determined to get to university while Renée is trying to figure out a way to tell her she doesn't what to go. They both start to find other 'interests': Flo finds God & Renee finds men.

Just as they seem to be going in different directions, a catastrophe makes them realise they need each other more then ever. They may be going onto different chapters of their lives but they will be each other's 'Goose' for ever.  

I enjoyed both <cite>Paper Aeroplanes</cite> and <cite>Goose</cite> a lot. I was 15 in the 90s, so a lot of the references meant something to me. I did like The Spice Girls and I did own a shell suit (hides face in shame!). If you are or ever were a teenage girl, you will understand everything that happens to Renée and Flo in these books.
