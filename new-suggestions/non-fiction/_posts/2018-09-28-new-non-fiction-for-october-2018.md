Claire Harman, who some readers may remember for her fascinating [biography of Charlotte Bronte](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1832533), moves into a different area with her latest book.

## [<cite>The Railway Adventures: places, trains, people and stations</cite>, by Geoff Marshall & Vicki Pipe](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2454078)

This beautifully illustrated book is also an evocative and humorous read, each chapter offering up to 20 wonders of the British railways.

## [<cite>Blowing the Bloody Doors Off and other lessons in life</cite>, by Michael Caine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2444492)

## [<cite>Under the Wig: a lawyer's stories of murder, guilt and innocence</cite>, by William Clegg](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2455091)

> "What happens in the cells when a lawyer first meets a man accused of a horrific murder? How does a barrister sway a jury? What do barristers and judges really say in private?

Includes details about the acquittal of Colin Stagg and the murder of Jill Dando.

## [<cite>More Dashing: further letters of Patrick Leigh Fermor</cite>, by Patrick Leigh Fermor & Adam Sisman (ed.)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2443450)

> "[<cite>Dashing for the Post</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1976419), the first selection of letters from Patrick Leigh Fermor (known to all as 'Paddy'), delighted critics and public alike. Here now is a further selection offering equal pleasure.

> "Paddy's exuberant letters exude a zest characteristic of the man. They contain glimpses of the great and the good: a chance conversation with the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, when Paddy opens the wrong door, or a glass of ouzo under the pine trees with Harold Macmillan. They describe encounters with such varied figures as Jackie Onassis, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Oswald Mosley and Peter Mandelson; while also relating adventures with the humble: a 'pick-nick' with the stonemasons at Kardamyli, or a drunken celebration in the Cretan mountains with his old comrades from the resistance, most of them simple shepherds and goatherds."

## [<cite>Wally Funk's Race for Space: the extraordinary story of a female aviation pioneer</cite>, by Sue Nelson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2468009)

> "In 1961, Wally Funk was among the Mercury 13, the first group of American pilots to pass the 'Women in Space' programme. Wally sailed through a series of rigorous physical and mental tests, her scores beating many of the male candidates', including those of John Glenn, the first American in orbit.

> "But just one week before she was due to enter the final phase of training, the programme was abruptly cancelled. A combination of politics and prejudice meant that none of the women ever flew into space. Undettered, Wally went on to become one of America's first female aviation inspectors and civilian flight instructors, though her dream of being an astronaut never dimmed.

> "In this offbeat odyssey, journalist and fellow space buff Sue Nelson travels with Wally, now approaching her 80th birthday, as she races to make her giant leap - before it's too late."

Publication of this book coincides with a Netflix documentary about the Mercury programme.

## [<cite>My Love Story: the autobiography</cite>, by Tina Turner](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2444522)

From one remarkable woman to another.

> "Tina Turner is the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll, a musical icon celebrating her 60th year in the industry. In this dramatic autobiography, she tells the story of a truly remarkable life in the spotlight. From her early years picking cotton in Nutbush, Tennessee to her rise to fame alongside Ike Turner, and finally to her phenomenal success in the 1980s and beyond, Tina candidly examines her personal history, from her darkest hours to her happiest moments and everything in between.

> "Brimming with her trademark blend of strength, energy, heart and soul, this book is a gripping, surprising memoir, as memorable and entertaining as any of her greatest hits."
