![The Last Girl, Mythos, So Here It Is](/images/featured/featured-november-2017-non-fiction.jpg)

## [<cite>The Last Girl: my story of captivity and my fight against the Islamic State</cite>, by Nadia Murad with Jenna Krajeski](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2271259)

This is an amazing story:

> "Nadia Murad is a courageous young woman who has endured unimaginable tragedy (losing eighteen members of her family) and degradation through sexual enslavement to ISIS. But she has fought back. This inspiring memoir takes us from her peaceful childhood in a remote village in Iraq through loss and brutality to safety in Germany. Courage and testimony can change the world: this is one of those books."

## [<cite>Aviation Landmarks: Norfolk and Suffolk</cite>, by Peter B. Gunn](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2265109)

> "Peter Gunn brings together many aspects of aviation history in the two counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, chronicled by place name in alphabetical order. Subjects include airfields, war graves and memorials but also the less obvious aeronautical connections in, for example, country houses, churches, pubs, buildings and streets, and the local stories linked with them."

## [<cite>Daemon Voices: essays on storytelling</cite>, by Philip Pullman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2268083)

While this has not received the same fanfare as Pullman's new novel [<cite>La Belle Sauvage</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160757), it is a very interesting read for fans:

> "In over 30 essays, written over 20 years, one of the world's great storytellers meditates on storytelling. Warm, funny, generous, entertaining, and above all, deeply considered, they offer thoughts on a wide variety of topics, including the origin and composition of Philip's own stories, the craft of writing and the storytellers who have meant the most to him."

## [<cite>Mythos: a retelling of the myths of Ancient Greece</cite>, by Stephen Fry](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2265096)

> "The Greek myths are the greatest stories ever told, passed down through millennia and inspiring writers and artists as varied as Shakespeare, Michelangelo, James Joyce and Walt Disney. They are embedded deeply in the traditions, tales and cultural DNA of the West.

> "In Stephen Fry's hands the stories of the titans and gods become a brilliantly entertaining account of ribaldry and revelry, warfare and worship, debauchery, love affairs and life lessons, slayings and suicides, triumphs and tragedies. You'll fall in love with Zeus, marvel at the birth of Athena, wince at Cronus and Gaia's revenge on Ouranos, weep with King Midas and hunt with the beautiful and ferocious Artemis. Thoroughly spellbinding, informative and moving, Stephen Fry's <cite>Mythos</cite> perfectly captures these stories for the modern age - in all their rich and deeply human relevance."

Stephen Fry is 'touring' this book, so expect a lot of media coverage.

## [<cite>So Here It Is: how the boy from Wolverhampton rocked the world with Slade</cite>, by Dave Hill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2282483)

> "In the 1970s, when Slade were the biggest band in the UK, Dave Hill was always the one having the most fun. With twenty-three Top 20 hits, six consecutive number-one singles and the smash hit <cite>Merry Xmas Everybody</cite> (which has charted every year since), Slade were unstoppable. Now, for the first time, the man whose outlandish costumes, glittering make-up and unmistakable hairstyle made Slade one of the definitive acts of the Glam rock era tells his story."

Anyone who was into pop music in the 1970s will remember Dave Hill's outrageous costumes. After the success ended, the original band broke up amid much acrimony. Dave eventually reformed Slade with Don Powell and still tours today.

## [<cite>Battle for Brexit</cite>, by Tim Shipman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2254680)

> "By the bestselling author of [<cite>All Out War: the full story of Brexit</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138936), shortlisted for the Orwell Prize 2017, this is the unmissable account of politics covering Theresa May's time as PM through to the end of the election campaign."

## [<cite>Elizabeth's Rival: the tumultuous tale of Lettice Knollys, Countess of Leicester</cite>, by Nicola Tallis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2265332)

> "Cousin to Elizabeth I and grandniece to Anne Boleyn, Lettice Knollys was destined to be a prominent figure at court. But her life would be one of dizzying highs and pitiful lows - caught in a love triangle with Robert Dudley and Elizabeth I, banished from court, embroiled in treason, losing a husband to the executioner's axe and further husbands and children to war and sickness.

> "At different times Countess of Essex and Countess of Leicester, Lettice lived from the reign of Henry VIII through to Charles I, her story offering an extraordinary and intimate perspective on the history of the period."
