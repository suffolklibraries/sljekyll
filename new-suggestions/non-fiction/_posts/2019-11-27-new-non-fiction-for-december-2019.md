## [<cite>Shadow City: a woman walks Kabul</cite>, by Taran N. Khan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2654672)

Fascinating portrait of the city and the authorâ€™s heritage.

> "When Indian journalist Taran Khan arrives in Kabul in 2006, she imagines it as a return - a journey to the land her forebears hailed from centuries ago. She finds an unexpected guide in her grandfather who - despite never visiting the city - knows it intimately through books and stories, poetry and myth.

> "With his voice in her head, and falling in with poets, doctors and other Kabulis, Khan uncovers a place quite different from the one she anticipated. Her wanderings reveal a fragile city in a state of flux: stricken by near-constant war, but flickering with the promise of peace, a shape-shifting place governed by age-old codes but experimenting with new modes of living.

> "These walks take her to the unvisited tombs of the dead, and to the land of the living: the booksellers, archaeologists, intrepid film-makers and entrepreneurs who are remaking and rebuilding this ancient 3,000-year-old city."
