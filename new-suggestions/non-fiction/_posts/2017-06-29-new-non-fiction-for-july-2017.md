![The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books, Nadiya's British Food Adventure, Different Class: football, fashion and funk - the story of Laurie Cunningham](/images/featured/featured-july-non-fiction.jpg)

## [<cite>Comfort: delicious bakes and family treats</cite>, by Candice Brown](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2176488)

The <cite>Great British Bake Off</cite> champion for 2016 brings out her first cookbook. This is sure to be all over the media:

> "Secondary school teacher and pub landlord's daughter Candice Brown stole the show with her amazing bakes and weekly lipstick change in <cite>The Great British Bake Off</cite> tent of 2016. This year the <cite>Sunday Times</cite> columnist, <cite>Loose Women</cite> and <cite>This Morning</cite> favourite is bringing out her first cookbook - all about home comforts. These are the recipes Candice learned to bake from her nan and mum, recipes close to her heart, that should be served up as a big generous slice - and preferably on a vintage plate if you have one."

## [<cite>The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books</cite>, by Martin Edwards](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2181612)

> "The main aim of detective stories is to entertain, but the best cast a light on human behaviour and display both literary ambition and accomplishment. Even unpretentious detective stories, written for unashamedly commercial reasons, can give us clues to the past and give us insight into a long-vanished world that, for all its imperfections, continues to fascinate. This book, written by Martin Edwards, serves as a companion to the British Library's internationally acclaimed series of Crime Classics."

## [<cite>The Unwomanly Face of War: an oral history of women in World War II</cite>, by Svetlana Aleksievich, translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169353)

Long-awaited English translation of the oral history of women in the Second World War across Europe and Russia, which was the Nobel prize-winnerâ€™s first book. It was published in 1985 and has sold more than 2 million copies:

> "Bringing together dozens of voices in her distinctive style, Svetlana Alexievich shares stories of women's experiences in World War II - on the front lines, on the home front, and in occupied territories. <cite>The Unwomanly Face of War</cite> is a powerful history of the central conflict of the twentieth century, a kaleidoscopic portrait of the human side of war."

## [<cite>A Life in the Day</cite>, by Hunter Davies](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2172924)

> "In this much-anticipated sequel [<cite>The Co-op's Got Bananas!</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2100658), Hunter looks back across five decades of successful writing to reflect on his colourful memories of living in London during the height of the swinging sixties, becoming editor of Britain's first colour weekend supplement <cite>The Sunday Times Magazine</cite>, befriending The Beatles, and interviewing (and partying with) the biggest names in television, film and theatre of the day."

## [<cite>Fall Down Seven Times, Get Up Eight: a young man's voice from the silence of autism</cite>, by Naoki Higashida, translated by David Mitchell and Ka Yoshida](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2171446)

> "<cite>Fall Down Seven Times, Get Up Eight</cite> is Naoki Higashida's gently subversive follow-up to his phenomenally popular book [<cite>The Reason I Jump: one boy's voice from the silence of autism</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1550932), which he wrote as a 13-year-old boy with severe autism. Now he shares his thoughts and experiences as a young man, exploring a range of topics from education, identity, family and society to personal growth."

## [<cite>Nadiya's British Food Adventure</cite>, by Nadiya Hussain](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169423)

2015 <cite>Great British Bake Off</cite> winner Nadiya returns with a new book which ties in to her latest TV series. In it, she "transforms familiar home-cooked dishes into fresh and enticing recipes, inspired by her spice cupboard, Bangladeshi family roots and British upbringing."

## [<cite>Different Class: football, fashion and funk - the story of Laurie Cunningham</cite>, by Dermot Kavanagh](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2180927)

> "<cite>Different Class</cite> is not a typical football biography, it's also about a time of fashion, music, dance and race.

> "Laurie Cunningham is an important but overlooked figure. He helped change the perceptions not only of football fans but of society too. He won crowds over with his style and swagger and brought glamour to the game at a particularly dark time in its history. His is a very British story of defining yourself through your creativity and imagination regardless of what people think. He is a pioneer whose performances on the pitch meant that black players had to be taken seriously and proved they could succeed at the highest level."
