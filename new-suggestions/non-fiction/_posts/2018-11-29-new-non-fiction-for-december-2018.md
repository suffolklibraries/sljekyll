## [<cite>Tom Kerridge's Fresh Start</cite>, by Tom Kerridge](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2471754)

Tom Kerridgeâ€™s last book [<cite>Lose Weight for Good: full-flavour cooking for a low-calorie diet</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2284553) was a huge hit, as was his TV series.

His latest book has 100 recipes made for homemade, healthier versions of fast foods. Again there will be a BBC series to accompany the book.

## [<cite>Quiet: silencing the brain chatter and believing that you're good enough</cite>, by Fearne Cotton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2471728)

> "In <cite>Quiet</cite>, Fearne Cotton explores why so many of us question whether we are, or will ever be, 'good enough.' This beautiful book, filled with Fearne's creative hand-drawn illustrations and thought-provoking activities to still your mind, will silence your inner-critic and stop you from continually self-sabotaging.

> "<cite>Quiet</cite> includes interviews with people who have helped Fearne to accept her flaws and love her own imperfections, as well as advice on how to drown out misinformation and the, sometimes, pressurising noise from family, work and friends, which can fuel our insecurities and self-doubt. Fearne talks honestly and openly about what it's like to live in the public eye and shares some of the methods and practical activities she uses to ignore negative online chatter and trolls."

## [<cite>Jog On: how running saved my life</cite>, by Bella Mackie](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2472230)

> "Divorced and struggling with long-rooted mental health problems, Bella Mackie ended her 20s in tears, scared of everything imaginable. She could barely find the strength to get off the sofa, let alone piece her life back together. Until one day she did something she hadn't done before - she pulled on a pair of trainers and went for a run.

> "Over the previous decade, Bella was so paralysed by her fears that exercise was the very last thing on her mind. So that first run didn't last very long. But to her surprise, she was back out there the next day. And the day after that. She began to set herself small goals - to run 5k in under 30 minutes, to walk to work every day for a week, to attempt 10 push-ups in a row. Before she knew it, her mood was lifting for the first time in years, and she had swapped hiding in her house for fresh air, unknown roads and running tracks."

Kim-Julie Hansen is a blogger who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, making hers the most followed vegan account worldwide. The 28 day plan sets out day-to-day meal plans and recipes for anyone wanting to follow her lead.

## [<cite>The Louise Parker Method: the 6-week programme</cite>, by Louise Parker](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2472418)
