## [<cite>Only Fools and Stories: from Del Boy to Granville, Pop Larkin to Frost</cite>, by David Jason](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2254990)

This is likely to be on the bestseller lists in the celebrity biography section:

> "In his first book ([<cite>David Jason: my life</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1592315)), David Jason told us about himself from his early years training as an electrician through to making it as one of Britain's best-loved actors. This autumn, in a follow up autobiography, he tells us about the many other lives he has lived - his characters. From Del Boy to Granville, Pop Larkin to Frost, he takes us behind the scenes and under the skins of some of the best loved acts of his career."

## [<cite>Over and Out</cite>, by Henry Blofeld](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2260605)

> "Henry Blofeld's voice is the sound of the summer to thousands of cricket lovers all over the world, and this autobiographical book is a celebration of his career commentating on the sport he loves. Henry has been a summariser on Test Match Special for over 40 years and cricket fans all over the world adore him, in this book he relives his favourite moments in the sport and shares behind the scenes anecdotes and stories told in his unique style."

## [<cite>Joan: the remarkable life of Joan Leigh Fermor</cite>, by Simon Fenwick](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2253174)

So much has been written by and about Patrick Leigh Fermor, but his wife Joan is often overshadowed by her husband. It is often forgotten that she was a talented photographer in her own right. Joan left an archive of 3,000 pictures and many letters, which the archivist Simon Fenwick has used to put together this biography.

## [<cite>Going on the Turn</cite>, by Danny Baker](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2022761)

Third volume of the popular broadcasterâ€™s autobiography. This edition covers his six years on TFI Friday including many celebrity encounters:

> "Danny Baker is a national treasure with a colourful life. For over a quarter of a century he has amused and entertained audiences on both radio and television. Beginning his career at the age of 15 in a small record shop in the London's West End, Danny went on to become a music journalist and started his radio career on BBC GLR in 1989. With a unique take on life and a lot to say, Danny's latest book is full of his trademark warmth, wit and showbiz."

## [<cite>Dare Not Linger: the presidential years</cite>, by Nelson Mandela & Mandla Langa](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2172958)

This is being marketed as a kind of follow-up to [<cite>Long Walk to Freedom</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1496179):

> "<cite>Dare Not Linger</cite> is the story of Mandela's presidential years, drawing heavily on the memoir he began to write as he prepared to finish his term of office, but was unable to finish. Now, the acclaimed South African writer, Mandla Langa, has completed the task using Mandela's unfinished draft, detailed notes that Mandela made as events were unfolding and a wealth of previously unseen archival material."

## [<cite>Darling Pol: letters of Mary Wesley and Eric Siepmann, 1944-1967</cite>, by Patrick Marnham & Mary Wesley](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2257717)

Fascinating collection of letters between novelist Mary Wesley and the man who was to become her second husband:

> "Before her death in 2002, Mary Wesley told her biographer Patrick Marnham: 'after I met Eric I never looked at anyone else again. We lived our ups and downs but life was never boring.'

> "Their correspondence - lively, intimate, passionate, frustrated - charted their life together (and apart) with unusual candour and spirit. Marnham suggests that through these letters Mary, who famously blossomed as a novelist in her seventies, a decade after Eric's death, found her voice."

## [<cite>Football: my life, my passion</cite>, by Graeme Souness](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2254879)

Graeme Souness is a Liverpool football legend who writes the way he played. He is uncompromising and not afraid to make enemies to get his point across.

This book covers his views on the game based on his nearly fifty years of involvement at the highest level and as a TV pundit.
