## [<cite>The Colour of Time: a new history of the world, 1850-1960</cite>, by Dan Jones & Marina Amaral](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2408256)

This is a staggering work. Marina Amaral takes photographs from the past which were in black and white and painstakingly uses digital techniques to colour them so we see them as we would see the world around us. The effects are startling – look at the illustration of Lewis Powell or The Nine Kings and marvel at the work that must have gone into creating the coloured image. This is one of my favourite books of the year.

## [<cite>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</cite>, by Yuval Noah Harari](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2408924)

> "[<cite>Sapiens</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1739371) showed us where we came from. [<cite>Homo Deus</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2127350) looked to the future. <cite>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</cite> explores the present. How can we protect ourselves from nuclear war, ecological cataclysms and technological disruptions? What can we do about the epidemic of fake news or the threat of terrorism? What should we teach our children? Yuval Noah Harari takes us on a thrilling journey through today's most urgent issues."

## [<cite>State of Play: under the skin of the modern game</cite>, by Mike Calvin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2409594)

The award-winning author of [<cite>The Nowhere Men</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1421744) and [<cite>No Hunger in Paradise</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2310072) returns with his analysis of the state of modern football, which will include a chapter on the 2018 World Cup. The chapter on the decline of former West Brom hero Jeff Astle is particularly moving.

## [<cite>Memory Activity Book</cite>, by DK](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2458737)

Some of you may be aware of the Pictures to Share series available in libraries to help dementia sufferers. <cite>The Memory Activity Book</cite> covers similar ground but is also aimed at families and carers. The book suggests a variety of brain stimulating activities accompanied by DK’s usual high quality illustrations. 225,000 people in the UK are predicted to develop dementia this year alone.

## [<cite>Endeavour: the ship and the attitude that changed the world</cite>, by Peter Moore](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2408903)

> "The Enlightenment was an age of endeavours. From Johnson's Dictionary to campaigns for liberty to schemes for measuring the dimensions of the solar system, Britain was consumed by the impulse for grand projects, undertaken at speed. 'Endeavour' was also the name given to a Whitby collier bought by the Royal Navy in 1768 for an expedition to the South Seas. A commonplace, coal-carrying vessel, no one could have guessed that Endeavour would go on to become the most significant ship in the history of British exploration.

> "Endeavour famously carried James Cook on his first great voyage, visiting Pacific islands unknown to European geography, charting for the first time New Zealand and the eastern coast of Australia and almost foundering on the Great Barrier Reef. But Endeavour has a secret history too."

August marks the 250th anniversary of Cook's voyage on Endeavour.

## [<cite>A Boy in the Water: a memoir</cite>, by Tom Gregory](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2414789)

Autobiography of the youngest boy ever to swim the English Channel, which was achieved by Gregory at the age of 11 in 1988. There is talk of this being made into a TV drama.
