![Into The Water, Need You Dead, Sidney Chambers and the Persistence of Love](/images/featured/featured-may-fiction.jpg)

## [<cite>Into The Water</cite>, by Paula Hawkins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2126792)

The author of the runaway bestseller and global phenomenon [<cite>The Girl on the Train</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1956254) returns with her much-anticipated new book <cite>Into The Water</cite>.

A single mother turns up dead at the bottom of the river that runs through town. Earlier in the summer, a vulnerable teenage girl met the same fate. They are not the first women lost to these dark waters, but their deaths disturb the river and its history, dredging up secrets long submerged.

We already have a waiting list for this but we have ordered lots of copies. The early indications are that this is even better than <cite>The Girl on the Train</cite>.

## [<cite>No Middle Name: the complete collected Jack Reacher stories</cite>, by Lee Child](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2153845)

Not new material, but this should keep Suffolkâ€™s Lee Child addicts going until the next book.

This is the first time all Lee Child's shorter fiction featuring Jack Reacher has been collected into one volume.

## [<cite>I'd Die For You and other lost stories</cite>, by F. Scott Fitzgerald](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2140410)

In case the bumper list this month was not holding your interest so far, here is a collection of the last remaining unpublished short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald, iconic author of [<cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1397144) and [<cite>Tender Is The Night</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=51184). It comprises 16 finished stories and one partial short fiction.

## [<cite>The Midnight Bell</cite>, by Jack Higgins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138832)

A more contemporary legend, Jack Higgins returns with his latest thriller:

> "The bell tolls at midnight as death requires it. But will it finally toll for Sean Dillon and company?"

## [<cite>Need You Dead</cite>, by Peter James](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2141046)

> "Lorna Belling, desperate to escape her marriage from hell, falls for the charms of another man who promises her the earth. But, as Lorna finds, life seldom follows the plans you've made. A chance photograph on a client's mobile phone changes everything for her.

> "When the body of a woman is found in a bath in Brighton, Detective Superintendent Roy Grace is called to the scene. At first it looks an open and shut case with a clear prime suspect. Then other scenarios begin to present themselves, each of them tantalizingly plausible, until, in a sudden turn of events, and to his utter disbelief, the case turns more sinister than Grace could ever have imagined."

## [<cite>New Boy</cite>, by Tracy Chevalier](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138888)

In the latest modern reimagining in the Hogarth Shakespeare series, Tracy Chevalier gives us her modern take on <cite>Othello</cite>:

> "Arriving at his fourth school in six years, diplomat's son Osei Kokote knows he needs an ally if he is to survive his first day, so he's lucky to hit it off with Dee, the most popular girl in school.

> "But one student can't stand to witness this budding relationship: Ian decides to destroy the friendship between the black boy and the golden girl. By the end of the day, the school and its key players, teachers and pupils alike will never be the same again."

## [<cite>Anything Is Possible</cite>, by Elizabeth Strout](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138211)

The author of [<cite>My Name is Lucy Barton</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2093124) returns with a collection of nine interrelated stories of small town life set around Lucy's family and the community in and around which she was raised.

If you enjoyed the previous book, this is one you really should read.

## [<cite>Anne Boleyn: a king's obsession</cite>, by Alison Weir](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2141014)

> "The second captivating novel in the series. An unforgettable portrait of the ambitious woman whose fate we know all too well, but whose true motivations may surprise you.

> "Fresh from the cultivated hothouse of Renaissance France, Anne draws attention at the English court. A nobleman, a poet and a king vie for her love. She has a spirit worthy of a crown - and a crown is what she seeks. It is a more powerful aphrodisiac than love. And so she embarks on her perilous course, which will plunge a kingdom into turmoil."

## [<cite>Men Without Women: stories</cite>, by Haruki Murakami, translated by Philip Gabriel and Ted Goossen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2138922)

We are extremely fortunate to live in an era when Murakami is writing. Not all of this book is new - some of it has appeared elsewhere - but if you like his writing you will love this.

All the stories are about men, lonely men, strange men, men without women. But every story has its own point and differs from the others. The stories are all quite short, between 30 and 50 pages, so the book is easy and fast to read, but should be savoured nonetheless.

## [<cite>Sidney Chambers and the Persistence of Love</cite>, by James Runcie](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2140995)

James Runcie has been a frequent visitor to Suffolk and was one of the stars of last year's Bookfest, speaking to audiences at our libraries not once but twice.

His latest book, set in May 1971, finds Archdeacon Sidney Chambers walking in a bluebell wood with his daughter Anna and their Labrador, Byron, when they stumble upon a body. Thrust into another murder investigation, Sidney discovers a world of hippies, folk music and psychedelic plants, where permissive behaviour seems to hide something darker.
