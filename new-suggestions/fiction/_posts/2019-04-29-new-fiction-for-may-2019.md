![Cari Mora, Crushed, Those Who Are Loved](/images/featured/featured-may-2019-fiction.jpg)

## [<cite>Cari Mora</cite>, by Thomas Harris](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2547909)

First novel in 13 years from the creator of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This is a standalone novel about a ruthless man desperate to find $25 million of cartel gold buried underneath a Miami Beach mansion.

> "Twenty-five million dollars in cartel gold lies hidden beneath a mansion on the Miami Beach waterfront. Ruthless men have tracked it for years. Leading the pack is Hans-Peter Schneider. Driven by unspeakable appetites, he makes a living fleshing out the violent fantasies of other, richer men.

> "Cari Mora, caretaker of the house, has escaped from the violence in her native country. She stays in Miami on a wobbly Temporary Protected Status, subject to the iron whim of ICE. She works at many jobs to survive. Beautiful, marked by war, Cari catches the eye of Hans-Peter as he closes in on the treasure. But Cari Mora has surprising skills, and her will to survive has been tested before. Monsters lurk in the crevices between male desire and female survival."

## [<cite>The Porpoise</cite>, by Mark Haddon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2548849)

Long awaited new book from the author of [<cite>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1619086). The new book is an eccentric retelling of Pericles, Prince of Tyre, that leaps between ancient and modern.

> "A newborn baby is the sole survivor of a terrifying plane crash. She is raised in wealthy isolation by an overprotective father. She knows nothing of the rumours about a beautiful young woman, hidden from the world. When a suitor visits, he understands far more than he should. Forced to run for his life, he escapes aboard The Porpoise, an assassin on his tail.

> "So begins a wild adventure of a novel, damp with salt spray, blood and tears. A novel that leaps from the modern era to ancient times; a novel that soars, and sails, and burns long and bright; a novel that almost drowns in grief yet swims ashore; in which pirates rampage, a princess wins a wrestler's hand, and ghost women with lampreys' teeth drag a man to hell - and in which the members of a shattered family, adrift in a violent world, journey towards a place called home."

## [<cite>Anna of Kleve, Queen of Secrets</cite>, by Alison Weir](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2547237)

Next Tudor Queen in Alison Weir’s popular series. Alison found some new evidence in her research for this novel, so expect some surprises.

> "The King is in love with Anna's portrait, but she has none of the accomplishments he seeks in a new bride. She prays she will please Henry, for the balance of power in Europe rests on this marriage alliance. But Anna's past is never far from her thoughts, and the rumours rife at court could be her downfall. Everyone knows the King won't stand for a problem queen."

## [<cite>The Doll Factory</cite>, by Elizabeth MacNeal](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2546373)

Debut novel that is reminiscent of [John Fowles’ <cite>The Collector</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=229127).

> "London, 1850. The Great Exhibition is being erected in Hyde Park and among the crowd watching the spectacle two people meet. For Iris, an aspiring artist, it is the encounter of a moment - forgotten seconds later, but for Silas, a collector entranced by the strange and beautiful, that meeting marks a new beginning.

> "When Iris is asked to model for pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint. Suddenly her world begins to expand, to become a place of art and love. But Silas has only thought of one thing since their meeting, and his obsession is darkening."

Victoria Hislop’s fifth novel and one of the biggest titles released in May.

> "Themis grows up during the brutal German occupation of Greece. In the subsequent Civil War, the country is polarised between Right and Left and Themis' family is bitterly divided.

> "During the violent five-year struggle for control of the country, she fights for Communists and is seduced by the leader of her rebel band. Captured and sent to the notoriously cruel islands of exile, Makronisos and Trikeri, Themis gives birth to a son, Angelos."

## [<cite>The Farm</cite>, by Joanne Ramos](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2543775)

## [<cite>The Furies</cite>, by Katie Lowe](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2544353)

> "1998. A sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on school property, dressed in white and posed on a swing. No known cause of death. Four girls know what happened. And until now they've kept their silence.

> "Violet is returning home, back to the sleepy coastal town which holds so many memories. In 1998, after a tragic accident claims the lives of her father and sister, she joins Elm Hollow Academy, a private girls' school with an unpleasant history of 17th century witch trials. There she is drawn to Robin, Grace, Alex and their charismatic teacher, Annabel; she is invited to join them in their advanced study group.

> "There they learn about art, literature and the grisly history of the school. Though Annabel claims her classes aren't related to ancient rites and rituals, she warns them off the topic, describing it as little more than mythology."

## [<cite>Crushed</cite>, by Kate Hamer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2544379)

> "Phoebe stands on Pultenay Bridge trying to cover her face with her hair so she won't be recognized. Her tights are gashed from toe to thigh. She has lost a shoe. People keep looking. Was it five, or ten minutes later she heard the commotion? Phoebe ran down the road until she saw. Mangled metal. Blood ran down the walls.

> "Phoebe believes this was of her making. She thought murder, and murder happened. She had told them her thoughts weren't just thoughts and now she must live with the consequences."

## [<cite>Frankissstein: a love story</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2547913)

Across the Atlantic, in Phoenix, Arizona, a cryogenics facility houses dozens of bodies of men and women who are medically and legally dead but waiting to return to life.

> "But the scene is set in 1816, when nineteen-year-old Mary Shelley writes a story about creating a non-biological life-form."

Fear is driving your well-behaved young daughter off the rails, and you find yourself in bed late at night, looking at the woman who lies asleep beside you. Because you thought you knew the worst about her. The truth is you know nothing at all."

> "Meanwhile, a wealthy divorcée plunges, in suspicious circumstances, from an apartment block in Munich. In the same week, Detective Superintendent Roy Grace is called to investigate the suicide of a woman in Brighton, that is clearly not what it seems.
