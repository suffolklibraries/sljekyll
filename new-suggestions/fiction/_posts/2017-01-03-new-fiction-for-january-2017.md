> "In 1989, a killer dumped the body of twenty-year-old Lucie Martin into a lake in the West of France. Fourteen years later, during a summer heat wave, a drought exposed her remains. No one was ever convicted of her murder. But now, forensic expert Enzo Macleod is reviewing this stone cold case - the toughest of those he has been challenged to solve. Yet when Enzo finds a flaw in the original evidence surrounding Lucie's murder, he opens a Pandora's box that not only raises old ghosts but endangers his entire family."

Although she's surrounded by a loving family, Marie feels lost; living with a lie can be very lonely. Marie has been carrying a secret for years, one that could ruin the lives of those she loves most, and the guilt she feels weighs heavily.

Josephine Cox is a born storyteller and this one is sure to be popular.

Spy Thomas Chaloner investigates another murder in 17th century London, this time during the plague. An unidentified skeleton is found in another man's grave, and it's linked to ongoing battles over the future of the crumbling, neglected St Paul's Cathedral. By returning to London to investigate, Chaloner risks death by illness or violence.

## [<cite>Corpus</cite>, by Rory Clements](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2067952)

Set in 1936. A young woman is found dead from an overdose of drugs, the police decide it is an accidental death. Her friend refuses to believe that it was anything but murder and enlists the help of Professor Thomas Wilde to prove this. Enquiries lead him to Yuri Kholtov, a visitor from Moscow.

When additional murders occur, clues deliberately set at the scene lead police to suspect communist involvement and Kholtov becomes a prime suspect. Wilde is approached by Philip Eaton, a reporter who offers assistance, but seems to know much more than he should. Together they tie the deaths to a conspiracy built around the scandal of King Edward's association with Wallis Simpson.

## [<cite>Gifts For Our Time</cite>, by Anna Jacobs](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080600)

The latest volume in the <cite>Rivenshaw</cite> Saga.

> "Germany, 1939, and Christa Sommer boards the Kindertransport, unsure that she'll ever see her beloved mother and father again. Once in England she is taken in by elderly Mrs Pelling, who grows to love Christa as the daughter she never had.

> "But in 1945 Mrs Pelling dies. When her will cannot be found, her money-grabbing niece appears out of the blue to claim her inheritance and turfs Christa out, with only a suitcase to her name. The prejudice against Germans still runs high in England, and Christa is unable to secure a job or a place to stay. Luck comes her way when a lady she saves from being mugged turns out to be Mayne Esher's friend Daniel's mother.

> "Taking pity on Christa, they take her to Rivenshaw where they plan to start a new life as part of the Esher building firm. There Christa is welcomed with open arms and she soon develops a love for the place, the people and Daniel."

Latest in the <cite>County Guides</cite> series.

> "October 1937. Swanton Morley, the people's professor, sets off to Essex to continue his history of England. Morley's daughter Miriam continues to cause chaos and his assistant Stephen Sefton continues to slide deeper into depression and despair. Morley is an honorary guest at the Colchester Oyster Festival. But when the mayor dies suddenly at the civic reception suspicion falls on his fellow councillors. Is it a case of food poisoning? Or could it be murder?"

## [<cite>Watch Her Disappear</cite>, by Eva Dolan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2080754)

> "The body is found by the river, near a spot popular with runners. With a serial rapist at work in the area, DI Zigic and DS Ferreira are initially confused when the Hate Crimes Unit is summoned to the scene. Until they discover that the victim, Corinne Sawyer, was born Colin Sawyer. Police records reveal there have been violent attacks on trans women in the local area. Was Corinne a victim of mistaken identity? Or has the person who has been targeting trans women stepped up their campaign of violence? With tensions running high, and the force coming under national scrutiny, this is a complex case and any mistake made could be fatal."

Eva Dolan is one of the rising stars of crime writing. If you haven’t read one of her books I strongly urge you to do so.
