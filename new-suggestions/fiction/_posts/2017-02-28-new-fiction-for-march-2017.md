## [<cite>War Cry</cite>, by Wilbur Smith and David Churchill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108804)

Wilbur Smith, with his latest co-writer David Churchill, returns to the Courtney family saga. Saffron Courtney grows up on a sprawling Kenyan estate, under the watchful eye of her father, prominent businessman and distinguished war veteran Leon Courtney. Her childhood is idyllic, until a family tragedy forces her to grow up much faster than necessary.

As she becomes a spirited teenager, her thirst for adventure leads her to England, where she finds herself inevitably drawn into the heart of the gathering storm in the lead up to World War II.

War Cry is a love story on an epic scale set against the backdrop of the second World War.

## [<cite>Lincoln in the Bardo</cite>, by George Saunders](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2115917)

Much anticipated full length novel debut from the famed US short-story writer. Based on the death of Abraham Lincolnâ€™s young son, it is a novel written in voices and set in a supernatural realm between life and death.

> "The American Civil War rages while President Lincoln's beloved 11-year-old son lies gravely ill. In a matter of days, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy's body.

> "From this seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss. Willie Lincoln finds himself trapped in a transitional realm - called, in Tibetan tradition, the bardo - and as ghosts mingle, squabble, gripe and commiserate, and stony tendrils creep towards the boy, a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul."

## [<cite>Exit West</cite>, by Mohsin Hamid](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2108914)

> "In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war, Saeed and Nadia share a cup of coffee, and their story begins. It will be a love story but also a story about war and a world in crisis, about how we live now and how we might live tomorrow.

> "Before too long, the time will come for Nadia and Saeed to leave their homeland. When the streets are no longer useable and all options are exhausted, this young couple will join the great outpouring of those fleeing a collapsing city, hoping against hope, looking for their place in the world."

The Scottish crime writer novelises a true crime with this extraordinary story of a 1950s Glasgow murder mystery.

> "William Watt wants answers about his family's murder. Peter Manuel has them. But Peter Manuel is a liar. William Watt is an ordinary businessman, a fool, a social climber. Peter Manuel is a famous liar, a rapist, a criminal. He claims he can get hold of the gun used to murder Watt's family. One December night in 1957, Watt meets Manuel in a Glasgow bar to find out what he knows."

> "Step into the shoes of Olive. You're a happy, open-hearted girl. Your (tricky) mother is dead and you live with your father in a solid, Edwardian house with apple trees in the garden. He's a kind man who does his fair share around the house. Your passion for books gets you easily into university, where the world is surely waiting for you. There, you take part in a play, and are noticed by the leading man. Even though he's not as glamorous off-stage, he becomes your boyfriend.

> "But then you make a mistake - the kind any one of us could make - and face an impossible choice. You are young, still, and full of hope. You can't possibly know how that mistake will sit in your heart. Or that when you get a wonderful job at a girls' school you will meet an older colleague and fall in love. But the affair must stay secret; the world won't have it any other way."

> "Why is joining a family so difficult? Jojo, Bess's stepdaughter, has a point to make. Bess is not her mother, and she won't replace the one she's been missing every day for the last two years. And will she ever get the chance to become a mum herself?

> "Cousin Cari is a fierce career-woman who isn't unnerved by anything - apart from facing the man who left her at the altar, and he's on the guest list. Her job has been a safe place to hide ever since - but is it time to let love into her life again?"

Soon his plans for a magnificent terrace built above the 200ft drop of the Gorge come under threat."
