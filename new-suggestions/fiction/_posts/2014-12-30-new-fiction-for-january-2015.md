      Instead of an exciting murder case, Detective Inspector Logan McRae gets a &#8216;development opportunity&#8217; in the depths of rural Aberdeenshire. However, a little girl&#8217;s body washes up outside the sleepy town of Banff, kicking off a manhunt. McRae&#8217;s old colleagues stomp around the countryside, burning bridges, and he gets dragged into the investigation.
