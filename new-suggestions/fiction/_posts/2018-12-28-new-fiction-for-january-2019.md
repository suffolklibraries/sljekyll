## [<cite>The Man With No Face</cite>, by Peter May](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2496815)

> "Brussels, 1979. Jaded Edinburgh journalist Neil Bannerman arrives in the capital of European politics intent on digging up dirt. Yet it is danger he discovers, when two British men are found murdered."

Peter May is one of our most popular thriller writers and we are already getting a waiting list for this one.

## [<cite>Last Man Standing</cite>, by Stephen Leather](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2490454)

Standalone thriller from the author of the bestselling Dan 'Spider' Shepherd books.

> "Friendships forged in the heat of combat can be stronger than anything. So when SAS trooper Matt Standing is told that the former Navy SEAL who saved his life is in trouble, he doesn't hesitate to go to his aid - even if that means flying half way around the world to Los Angeles.

> "Navy SEAL-turned-bodyguard Bobby-Ray Barnes has been accused of killing the man he was supposed to be protecting. Three other bodyguards were also killed and now Bobby-Ray is on the run. The dead client was a Russian oligarch with connections to the Kremlin. But who wanted him dead? And if Bobby-Ray wasn't the killer, who carried out the assassination and why is Bobby-Ray being framed? Standing is the only man who can answer those questions - providing he can stay alive long enough."

## [<cite>The Moment Before Impact</cite>, by Alison Bruce](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2488316)

> "Death, disappearance and divorce have shaped Jack Bailey's life. The breakdown of his marriage and the loss of his beloved daughter force him to make a new start. He reluctantly returns to Cambridge, his childhood home, but his decision means living in the shadow that still hangs over the place where he grew up. The old house stirs memories and his reappearance causes ripples amongst the locals who still remember the night, eleven years earlier, when his stepsister vanished without a trace.

> "When another woman disappears, history seems to be repeating itself. The police probe Jack's past and the only possible witness refuses to help."

## [<cite>Once Upon a River</cite>, by Diane Setterfield](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2395644)

From the author of bestseller [<cite>The Thirteenth Tale</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1497058).

> "A dark midwinter's night in an ancient inn on the Thames. The regulars are entertaining themselves by telling stories when the door bursts open on an injured stranger. In his arms is the drowned corpse of a little child. Hours later the dead girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life. Is it a miracle? Is it magic? Or can it be explained by science?"

## [<cite>The Chestnut Man</cite>, by SÃ¸ren Sveistrup](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2447373)

> "On a blistery autumn morning Rosa Hartung returns to her job as Minister for Social Affairs, a year after the dramatic disappearance of her 12-year-old daughter. Linus Berger, a mentally disturbed young man, confessed to her killing, but claims he can't remember where he buried her dismembered corpse.

> "That same day Rosa returns to Parliament, a young mother is found murdered at her home in the suburbs of Copenhagen - she's been tortured, and one hand has been cut off. Detectives Thulin and Hess, sent to investigate the crime, arrive to find a figure made of chestnut hanging from a nearby playhouse. When yet another woman is murdered, and another chestnut figure is found, Thulin and Hess begin to suspect that there's a connection between the previously closed Hartung case and the new recent victims."

## [<cite>Louis & Louise</cite>, by Julie Cohen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2494507)

From the author of book group favourite [<cite>Together</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2309663).

> "On 8th September 1978, Louis David Alder is born male. On 8th September 1978, Louise Dawn Alder is born female. Louis and Louise are the same in many ways - they have the same best friends, the same parents, the same dream of being a writer and leaving their hometown in Maine as soon as they can. But because of their gender, everything looks different, which makes you question: If you could look at one life in two different ways, what would you see?"

## [<cite>Hunted</cite>, by Arne Dahl](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2496832)

Second instalment in the Sam Berger series.

> "It starts when Desire Rosenkvist of Stockholm Police receives a letter. Two things are immediately clear: the letter she holds in her hands was written in a state of utter desperation and paranoia. And it contains details of one of her old murder cases, which only the murderer could know.

> "Desire contacts private investigator Sam Berger, who sets off to the remote north of Sweden with his colleague Molly Blom to find the author of the letter and to stop them in their tracks. But someone wants to keep them from getting to the bottom of the mystery at any cost and is watching their every move. What happens when the cops become the prey?"

## [<cite>The Wall</cite>, by John Lanchester](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2496678)

> "Kavanagh begins his life patrolling the Wall. If he's lucky, if nothing goes wrong, he only has two years of this, 729 more nights. The best thing that can happen is that he survives and gets off the Wall and never has to spend another day of his life anywhere near it. He longs for this to be over; longs to be somewhere else. He will soon find out what Defenders do and who the Others are. Along with the rest of his squad, he will endure cold and fear day after day, night after night. But somewhere, in the dark cave of his mind, he thinks: wouldn't it be interesting if something did happen, if they came, if you had to fight for your life?"

I have heard excellent reports about this one. Some are already saying it will be one of the books of 2019.

## [<cite>The Distance Home</cite>, by Paula Saunders](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2499552)

Beautifully written debut which will appeal to readers of Anne Tyler. Paula Saunders is the wife of Booker Prize winner George Saunders.

> "In 1960s rural America two siblings grow up in a place of love and turmoil. Rene is the apple of her father's eye: an over-achiever, athletic, clever, the best brain in class, and the best dancer in school. Her older brother Leon, doted on by his mother, is shy, a stutterer, but also a brilliant dancer. Rene and Leon share a talent, but it is a gift their father adores in his daughter, and loathes in his son. These two children may be best friends, but life promises to take them down very different paths."

## [<cite>When All Is Said</cite>, by Anne Griffin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2495121)

Set over the course of one night, this book tells the story of 84 year old Irish farmer Maurice Hannigan. He orders five drinks at the bar and with each one toasts a key person in his life on what may be his last day alive.
