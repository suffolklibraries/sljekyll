      Flaubert put much of his own life into the bored, beautiful housewife at the centre of his 1857 tale of provincial adultery. The story is now 150 years old, but readers of both sexes continue to find themselves and their friends in its pages.

      Fitzgerald himself called his 1925 portrait of the Jazz Age and story of obsessive love a &#8220;consciously artistic achievement&#8221; and a &#8220;purely creative work.&#8221; It offers complicated characters who can be interpreted in fresh ways by new readers. It is also beautifully written.

It’s based on the real town of Ciudad Juarez, where thousands of women have been murdered or gone missing in the past 20 years. This is Bolano’s masterpiece.

      The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia&#8217;s nineteenth century landed gentry. While comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century. Some of these problems included the uselessness of landowners and gentry in a feudal society that did not encourage innovation or reform. This is beautifully written and has a lot to say about the human condition.
