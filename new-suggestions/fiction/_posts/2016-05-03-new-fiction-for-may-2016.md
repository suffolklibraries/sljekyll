Another case for Detective Superintendent Roy Grace. We are already getting a waiting list for this one. An ugly duckling as a child, Jodie Bentley had two dreams in life - to be beautiful and rich. She's achieved the first, with a little help from a plastic surgeon, and now she's working hard on the second. Her philosophy on money is simple: you can either earn it or marry it. Marrying is easy, it's getting rid of the husband afterwards that's harder, that takes real skill.

Hopeless failed actor Berthold is exactly the same age as George Clooney (they share a birthday), but still lives with his mum. When he realises at her deathbed that he may lose his mother's lovely council flat, built in the 1960s by celebrated architect Lubetkin, he adopts the old lady in the hospital bed next door and takes her home to impersonate his mum. What could possibly go wrong?

Former Chief Constable Bob Skinner has seen a few crime scenes during his 30-year career. But few have affected him quite as much as the horrifying sight he finds in the back of a stolen car that collides with his own on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As his former colleagues investigate the mystery, Skinner is left to take on the unusual challenge of tracing a million-pound yacht, vanished from its mooring. And yet, as the body count rises, a link surfaces that could provide the key to both. And as discord spreads within the newly unified Police Scotland, it will soon become clear whether Skinner is on the side of the angels - or working against them.

In 1988, two girls with identical names and the same love of ballet meet for the first time. They seem destined to be best friends forever and to become professional dancers. Years later, however, they have both been dealt so many cruel and unexpected blows that they walk away from each other into very different futures - one enters a convent, the other becomes a minor celebrity. Will these new, 'invisible' lives be the ones they were meant to live, or will they only find that kind of salvation when they are reunited 20 years later?

Set in 2029. Darkly funny and unsettling novel with some outcomes that can almost be seen now. The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their 97-year-old patriarch dies. Yet America's soaring national debt has grown so enormous that it can never be repaid. Under siege on the currency markets, the dollar is in meltdown. A bloodless world war will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Their inheritance turned to dust, each family member must contend with disappointment, and as the effects of the downturn start to hit, the challenge of survival. Recently wealthy Avery is petulant that she can't buy olive oil, while her sister Florence is forced to absorb strays into her cramped household. As their father Carter fumes at having to care for his stepmother now that a nursing home is too expensive, his sister Nollie, an expat author, returns from abroad to a country that's unrecognizable.

And finally, one that has been on most people’s must read lists for 2016, The latest Rose Tremain. It is the tutor who tells the young Gustav that he must try to be more like a coconut - that he needs a hard shell to protect the softness inside. This is what his native Switzerland has perfected - a shell to protect its neutrality, to keep its people safe. But his beloved friend, Anton, doesn't want to be safe - a gifted pianist, he longs to make his mark on the world outside. On holiday one summer in Davos, the boys stumble across a remote building. Long ago, it was a TB sanitorium; now it is wrecked and derelict. Here, they play a game of life and death, deciding which of their imaginary patients must burn. It becomes their secret. 'The Gustav Sonata' begins in the 1930s, under the shadow of the Second World War, and follows the boys into maturity, and middle age, where their friendship is tested as never before.
