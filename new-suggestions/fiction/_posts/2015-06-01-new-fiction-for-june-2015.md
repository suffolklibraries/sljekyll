      Limited space requires limited numbers. The year is 2059. Noa Blake is just another normal 15 year-old. Except in The Territory normal isn&#8217;t normal. The richest children have a node on the back of their necks and can download information and bypass the need to study. In a flooded world of dwindling resources, Noa and the other &#8216;Norms&#8217; have their work cut out to even compete. And competing is everything â€“ because anybody who fails the TAA exam at 15 will be shipped off to the disease-ridden Wetlands, which means a life of misery, if not certain death.
