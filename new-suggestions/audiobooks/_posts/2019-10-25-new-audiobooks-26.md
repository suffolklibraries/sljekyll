> "No visitors. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter in a high-profile and mysterious Manhattan building. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendour of her surroundings and accepts the terms.

> "Soon, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story - until the next day, when Ingrid disappears."

Gabriel has no idea why he's been included, or what his connection to the farm - or the Melchiors - can be. As the first apples begin to fall, will Dragonfly Farm give up its secrets?"

> "And Flora discovers she's not the only one invited when her ex-husband shows up out of the blue, complete with his new wife. So now there are <em>two</em> small snags.

> "Can Flora spend the summer playing happy families with the woman who stole her husband's heart, and the mother-in-law who might have had a hand in it? Or will stumbling on the family secret change her mind about them all?"
