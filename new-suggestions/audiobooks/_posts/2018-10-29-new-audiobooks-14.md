> "Waterloo Bridge, London. Two strangers collide. Attila, a Ghanaian psychiatrist, and Jean, an American studying the habits of urban foxes.

> "From this chance encounter in the midst of the rush of a great city, numerous moments of connections span out and interweave, bringing disparate lives together. Attila has arrived in London with two tasks: to deliver a keynote speech on trauma and to check up on the daughter of friends, his 'niece', Ama, who hasn't called home in a while. It soon emerges that she has been swept up in an immigration crackdown - and now her young son Tano is missing.

> "When by chance Attila bumps into Jean again, she joins him in his search for Tano, mobilising into action the network she has built up, mainly from the many West African immigrants working London's myriad streets, of volunteer fox-spotters: security guards, hotel doormen, traffic wardens."

> "When his estranged daughter Katherine suddenly appears on his doorstep, Elder knows that something is badly wrong.

> "Every working mum has had to face it. The guilt-fuelled, anxiety-filled first day back in the office after maternity leave. But this working mum is one of a kind.

> "Meet Alexis Tyler. An elite covert agent within Her Majesty's Secret Service. Her first project back is a high-stakes hit of global significance and the old boys' network of government espionage is far from ready for the return of an operational mother. But woe betide anyone who ever tells Alexis Tyler 'you can't'. She will have it all. Or she'll die trying. And yes, she damn well will be home for bath time."

### [<cite>Bitter Sun</cite>, by Beth Lewis, read by Christopher Ragland](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2380115)

> "In the heatwave summer of 1971, four kids find a body by a lake and set out to solve a murder. But they dig too deep and ask too many questions. Larson is a town reeling in the wake of the Vietnam draft, where the unrelenting heat ruins the harvest, and the people teeter on the edge of ruin. As tension and paranoia run rife, rumours become fact, violence becomes reflex."

### [<cite>The Reason I Jump</cite>, by Naoki Higashida & David Mitchell (trans.), read by Thomas Judd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1748100)

> "Written by Naoki Higishida when he was only 13, this remarkable book explains the often baffling behaviour of autistic children and shows the way they think and feel - such as about the people around them, time and beauty, noise, and themselves. Naoki abundantly proves that autistic people do possess imagination, humour and empathy, but also makes clear, with great poignancy, how badly they need our compassion, patience and understanding."

### [<cite>The Mum Who'd Had Enough</cite>, by Fiona Gibson, read by Paul Tyreman, Rachael-Louise Miller, Nigel Pilkington & Sara Pyzer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2445821)

> "Nate Turner has a nice life. He has a steady job as a driving examiner and lives with his wife Sinead and son Flynn in a lovely house in a good part of town. Yes, it's a very nice life. Until one morning Nate comes downstairs to find Sinead gone and a note lying on the kitchen table, listing all the many things that Nate does wrong - or doesn't do at all.

> "Now, somehow, Nate needs to show Sinead he can change - fast. But as Nate works on being a better husband and dad, his life changes in amazing and unexpected ways. And he starts to wonder whether he wants to go back to normal after all. Could there be more to life than nice?"

> "On a beautiful May morning at New York's JFK Airport, a routine plane departs for San Francisco. Security agent Bernice Adams finds a postcard of the Golden Gate Bridge bearing an ambiguous message. Who left the postcard behind, which flight is that person on, and what exactly does the message mean? Her supervisor dismisses her concerns but she is compelled to contact Homeland Security.

> "As the flight takes off each of the passengers is looking forward to reaching San Francisco, whether it's for a family reunion, a wedding, or a new way of life. But as it emerges, there's someone on the flight planning something terrible and these strangers' lives entwine as they come together to help to avert a tragedy at the eleventh hour."

> "When Angela met Jason Powell, while catering a function in the Hamptons, she assumed their romance would be a short-lived fling, but Jason, a brilliant economics professor at NYU, had other plans, and they married the following summer. For Angela, the marriage turned out to be a chance to start again, for her and her young son to move from her mother's home to Manhattan, where no one knew of her tragic past.

> "Six years later, thanks to a best-selling book and a growing media career, Jason has become a celebrated liberal figurehead, placing Angela near the spotlight she worked so carefully to avoid. When a college intern makes an accusation against Jason, and another woman, Kerry Lynch, comes forward with an even more troubling allegation, their perfect life begins to unravel. Jason insists he is innocent, but increasingly Angela is forced to ask how well she ever really knew her husband."

And then there are the awful noises coming from the church at night.

> "Yet as the months go by, Bea slowly grows accustomed to life on the island. That is until an unexpected and interminably humming guest arrives, and the couple's claustrophobic existence is stretched to breaking point.

> "<cite>The Courage to be Disliked</cite> shows you how to unlock the power within yourself to become your best and truest self, change your future and find lasting happiness. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of 19th century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, the authors explain how we are all free to determine our own future free of the shackles of past experiences, doubts and the expectations of others. It's a philosophy that's profoundly liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change, and to ignore the limitations that we and those around us can place on ourselves."

> "My qualification for writing this book is not that I am better than you, it's that I am worse. I am an addict, addicted to drugs, alcohol, sex, money, love and fame.

> "The program in <cite>Recovery</cite> has given Russell Brand freedom from all addictions and it will do the same for you. This system offers nothing less than liberation from self-centredness, a new perspective, freedom from the illusion of suffering for anyone who is willing to take the necessary steps."

> "We have within us the ability to perform acts of great kindness, and great evil. We would like to think that there are some things that we would always do, and some things that we would never do. But how can we know?

> "The answers lie with the Ten Types of Human: the people we become when we are faced with the most difficult decisions. But who are they? Where are they from? And how did they get into your head?

> "<cite>The Ten Types of Human</cite> is a pioneering examination of human nature. It explores how our minds work, and examines what forces come into play when we are placed in extreme situations. It begins in a courtroom, and journeys across four continents in search of answers.

> "Can you really rewire an adult brain?

> "In theory the answer is 'yes', but there's a problem: no-one seems to know exactly how to do it.

> "In <cite>Override</cite>, science journalist Caroline Williams sets off on a mission to find the answer. Delving into the latest studies on brain plasticity, which indicate that brain games don't actually do much to make you smarter, she tries to square her findings with the reality of brain plasticity â€“ that the brain adapts physically as we learn something new.

> "Visiting top neuroscientists in their labs, Williams volunteers herself as a guinea pig in neuroscience studies, challenging researchers to make real changes to her â€“ functioning, but imperfect â€“ brain. Seeking first to improve on her own weaknesses, such as a limited attention span and a tendency to worry too much, she then branches out into more mysterious areas such as intelligence, creativity and the perception of time.

> "Trying everything from high-tech brain stimulation to meditation, adding bolt-on senses and retraining her stress response, <cite>Override</cite> is a very intimate, fascinating journey into discovering what neuroscience can really do for us â€“ and, crucially, whether it's worth all the bother."

Here he creates a new outlook on the pursuit of happiness â€“ it's not just how you feel, it's how you act.

> "<cite>Happiness by Design</cite> shows that being happier requires us to actively re-design our immediate environment. Enough has been written on how to think happy. <cite>Happiness by Design</cite> is about how to behave happy and how to incorporate the most recent research findings into our everyday lives."
