> "Logan McRae's personal history is hardly squeaky clean, but now that he works for Professional Standards he's policing his fellow officers. When Detective Inspector Bell turns up dead in the driver's seat of a crashed car it's a shock to everyone. Because Bell died two years ago, they buried him. Or they thought they did.

> "As an investigation is launched into Bell's stabbing, Logan digs into his past. Where has he been all this time? Why did he disappear?

But the deeper Logan digs, the more bones he uncovers - and there are people out there who'll kill to keep those skeletons buried."

Aisling goes out every Saturday night with Majella, her very best friend and loyal confidante. Twice a week, Aisling spends the night at her boyfriend Generic John's house.

### [<cite>Moab is my Washpot</cite>, written and read by Stephen Fry](https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/media/606180)

> "a) A fatuous, wasted, degenerate and wholly useless existence captured in delicate, lyrical and exquisitely realised prose.

> "b) Lightly amusing anecdotes and tender reminiscences of the great men and women encountered during a rich, varied and rewarding lifetime, fondly remembered in the tranquil evening of a career of public service.

> "c) The autobiography of a dizzying life fuelled by the lust for power and the search for ever more degrading downward paths of repulsive sexual adventuring and self-destructive debaucheries: the unrepentant libertine author seeks revenge on his many enemies and tears the lid off the private life of blameless churchmen and librarians.

> "Fry's autobiography is all and none of these. Too old to rock and roll, too young to die, the author looks back with bruising frankness at his life so far."
