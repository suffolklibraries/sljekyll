## [<cite>Don't Ever Tell</cite>, by Lucy Dawson, read by Georgia Maguire](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2629988)

> "This is a story about Charlotte - a mother and a wife with the perfect job, the perfect life - at least, that's how it looks from the outside. But behind closed doors, the marriage is breaking, and Charlotte's husband Tris doesn't even know how much. He has no idea what Charlotte has planned for him, who she has found, why she has hired someone to pretend to be her. But he doesn't have long to wait to find out."

## [<cite>The Mister</cite>, by E. L. James, read by Dominic Thorburn & Jessica O'Hara-Baker](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2630702)

> "London, 2019. Life has been easy for Maxim Trevelyan. With his good looks, aristocratic connections and money, he's never had to work, and he's rarely slept alone. But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family's noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It's a role he's not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.

> "But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who's recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful and musically gifted, she's an alluring mystery, and Maxim's longing for her deepens into a passion that he's never experienced and dares not name.

> "Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her? And what will she do when she learns that he's been hiding secrets of his own?"
