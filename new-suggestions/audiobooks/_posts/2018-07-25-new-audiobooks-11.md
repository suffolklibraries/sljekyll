> "When a four-year-old girl disappears in the woods just outside Fjällbacka, the community is horror-struck. 30 years ago, a young girl went missing from the exact same spot, and was later discovered, murdered. Back then, two teenage girls were found guilty of the killing. Could it really be a coincidence that one of the girls - now a world-famous actress - has just returned to Fjällbacka?

> "Detective Patrik Hedström starts investigating, with his wife, bestselling crime writer Erica Falck, by his side. But as Patrik and Erica dig deeper, the truth becomes ever murkier, because it seems that everyone in the tight-knit community is hiding something. And soon, the residents must confront the fact that they could be harbouring a murderer in their midst."

### [<cite>The Perfectly Imperfect Woman</cite>, by Milly Johnson, read by Colleen Prendergast](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2345989)

> "Marnie Salt has made so many mistakes in her life that she fears she will never get on the right track. But when she 'meets' an old lady on a baking chatroom and begins confiding in her, little does she know how her life will change. Arranging to meet, Marnie discovers that Lilian is every bit as delightful as she'd hoped - and that she owns a whole village in the Yorkshire Dales. And when Marnie needs a refuge after a crisis, she ups sticks and heads for Wychwell.

> "But soon Marnie finds that Wychwell has claimed her as its own. Even if what she has to do makes her as unpopular as a force 12 gale in a confetti factory!"

### [<cite>Have You Seen Her?</cite>, by Karen Rose, read by Robert G. Slade](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2345990)

### [<cite>Tinkers</cite>, by Paul Harding, read by Christian Rummel](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2350319)

> "An old man lies dying. Confined to bed in his living room, he sees the walls around him begin to collapse, the windows come loose from their sashes, and the ceiling plaster fall off in great chunks, showering him with a lifetime of debris: newspaper clippings, old photographs, wool jackets, rusty tools, and the mangled brass works of antique clocks. Soon, the clouds from the sky above plummet down on top of him, followed by the stars, till the black night covers him like a shroud.

> "He is hallucinating, in death throes from cancer and kidney failure. A methodical repairer of clocks, he is now finally released from the usual constraints of time and memory to rejoin his father, an epileptic, itinerant peddler, whom he had lost seven decades before."

### [<cite>Look for Me</cite>, by Lisa Gardner, read by Regina Reagan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2389608)

> "Newly married, newly pregnant, Lucy Robin is having trouble remembering the little things. Like what day she's due to visit her mother. Or where she left her shoes. Or whether she's left the gas hob on.

> "Forgetting the little things is annoying, but the more it happens, the more scared she gets. As her world gets smaller, soon both Lucy's life, and that of her unborn baby, are placed in danger. But is there something more sinister behind Lucy's forgetfulness? Her husband doesn't think so. And Adam always knows best."

### [<cite>The Devil's Dice</cite>, by Roz Watkins, read by Caro Clarke](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2375702)

> "A lawyer is found dead in a Peak District cave, his face ribboned with scratches. Amidst rumours of a local curse, DI Meg Dalton is convinced this is cold-blooded murder. There's just one catch - chiselled into the cave wall above the body is an image of the grim reaper and the dead man's initials, and it's been there for over a century.

> "As Meg battles to solve the increasingly disturbing case, it's clear someone knows her secrets. The murderer is playing games with Meg - and the dice are loaded."

### [<cite>Report for Murder</cite>, by Val McDermid, read by Caroline Guthrie](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2366482)

> "Freelance journalist Lindsay Gordon is strapped for cash. Why else would she agree to cover a fund-raising gala at a girls' public school?

> "Five women reluctantly pick up their backpacks and start walking along the muddy track. Only four come out the other side. The hike through the rugged landscape is meant to take the office colleagues out of their air-conditioned comfort zone and teach resilience and team building. At least that is what the corporate retreat website advertises.

> "Federal Police Agent Aaron Falk has a particularly keen interest in the whereabouts of the missing bushwalker. Alice Russell is the whistleblower in his latest case - and Alice knew secrets. About the company she worked for and the people she worked with. Far from the hike encouraging teamwork, the women tell Falk a tale of suspicion, violence and disintegrating trust. And as he delves into the disappearance, it seems some dangers may run far deeper than anyone knew."

### [<cite>Mercy Killing</cite>, by Lisa Cutts, read by Deryn Edwards](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392828)

> "The death of a local sex offender places the police officers at East Rise incident room under immense pressure - they must treat this case like any other murder, but they know what Albie Woodville did and can feel little sympathy. Except, as the investigation progresses, it becomes clear this isn't just a one-off killing - someone is out for revenge."

> "1957, Munich. Bernie Gunther's latest move in a long string of varied careers sees him working for an insurance company. It makes a kind of sense: both cops and insurance companies have a vested interest in figuring out when people are lying to them, and Bernie has a lifetime of experience to call on.

> "Sent to Athens to investigate a claim from a fellow German for a ship that has sunk, Bernie takes an instant dislike to the claimant. When he discovers the ship in question once belonged to a Greek Jew deported to Auschwitz, he is convinced the sinking was no accident but an avenging arson attack. Then the claimant is found dead, shot through both eyes.

> "It's a win for Bernie's employers at least: no one to pay out to even if the claim is genuine. But who is behind the murder, and why?"

### [<cite>The Last Hour</cite>, by Harry Sidebottom, read by Dugald Bruce Lockhart](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392858)

> "A lone figure stands silhouetted atop the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Far below, the river is in full flood. The City of Rome lies spread out before him on the far bank. Footsteps pound up the stairs. He's been set up.

> "An enemy is closing in; he is cornered. He jumps. Bruised and battered, he crawls out of the raging river. He is alone and unarmed, without money or friends, trapped in a deadly conspiracy at the heart of the Empire. The City Watch has orders to take him alive; other, more sinister, forces want him dead.

> "As the day dies, he realises he has only 24 hours to expose the conspirators, and save the leader of the world. If the Emperor dies, chaos and violence will ensue. If the Emperor dies, every single person he loves will die. He must run, bluff, hide and fight his way across the Seven Hills. He must reach the Colosseum, and the Emperor. He must make it to The Last Hour."

### [<cite>The Hoarder</cite>, by Jess Kidd, read by Aoife McMahon](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392878)

> "Maud Drennan - underpaid carer and unintentional psychic - is the latest in a long line of dogsbodies for the ancient, belligerent Cathal Flood. Yet despite her best efforts, Maud is drawn into the mysteries concealed in his filthy, once-grand home. She realises that something is changing: Cathal, and the junk-filled rooms, are opening up to her.

> "With only her agoraphobic landlady and a troop of sarcastic ghostly saints to help, Maud must uncover what lies beneath Cathal's decades-old hostility, and the strange activities of the house itself. And if someone has hidden a secret there, how far will they go to ensure it remains buried?"

### [<cite>The Silver Wolf</cite>, by Rob Sinclair, read by Marston York](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392829)

> "Ex-intelligence agent James Ryker sets out on a revenge mission that takes him from the crystal waters of Mexico's Caribbean coast right back to his country of birth, England.

But just who is he, and why is he hell-bent on punishing not just Ryker but his closest allies?"

### [<cite>Born Bad</cite>, by Helen Burnside, read by Emma Swan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392030)

> "Brother and sister Peter and Adele Robinson never stood a chance. Dragged up by an alcoholic, violent father and a weak, beaten mother, their childhood in Manchester only prepared them for a life of crime and struggle.

> "But Adele is determined to break the mould. She studies hard at school and, inspired by her beloved grandmother Joyce, she finally makes a successful life for herself on her own.

> "Peter is not so lucky. Getting more and more immersed in the murky world of crime and gangs, his close bonds with Adele gradually loosen until they look set to break altogether."

### [<cite>Perfect Death</cite>, by Helen Fields, read by Robin Laing](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392756)

> "There's no easy way to die. Unknown to DI Luc Callanach and the newly promoted DCI Ava Turner, a serial killer has Edinburgh firmly in his grip. The killer is taking his victims in the coldest, most calculating way possible - engineering slow and painful deaths by poison, with his victims entirely unaware of the drugs flooding their bloodstream until it's too late.

> "But how do you catch a killer who hides in the shadows? A killer whose pleasure comes from watching pain from afar? Faced with their most difficult case yet, Callanach and Turner soon realise they face a seemingly impossible task."

### [<cite>Death of a Macho Man</cite>, by M. C. Beaton, read by David Monteath](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2355749)

> "Everybody in Lochdubh knew about the Macho Man, a bully who claimed to be a professional wrestler. His insults and sneaking around caused concern. So when he challenged PC Macbeth to a public fight, it triggered an epidemic of bookmaking."

> "It was two days after Christmas when Kinsey Millhone received the bank slip showing a credit for five thousand dollars.

> "The account number was correct but Kinsey hadn’t made the deposit.

> "Then came the phone call and suddenly everything became clear. The frame-up was working and Kinsey was trapped..."

### [<cite>The Right Time</cite>, by Danielle Steel, read by Victor Bevine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2392823)

> "Alexandra Winslow takes solace in the mysteries she reads with her devoted father - and soon she is writing them herself, graduating to dark, complex crime stories that reflect skill, imagination and talent far beyond her years. Alex writes in every spare moment, gripped by the plots and themes and characters that fill her mind. Midway through college, she has finished a novel - and manages to find a seasoned agent, then a publisher.

> "But as she climbs the ladder of publishing success, she resolutely adheres to her father's admonition: Men read crime thrillers by men only - and so she publishes under a male pseudonym, her true identity known known only to those closest to her - creating a double life that isolates her. Her secret life - and her own life as a talented young woman - exposes her to the envious, the arrogant and Hollywood players who have no idea who she really is."

Abagnale — alias Frank Williams, Robert Conrad, Frank Adams, and Robert Monjo — one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history. In his brief but notorious criminal career, Abagnale donned a pilot's uniform and copiloted a Pan Am jet, masqueraded as the supervising resident of a hospital, practiced law without a license, passed himself off as a sociology professor, and cashed over $2.5 million in forged checks, all before he was twenty-one.
