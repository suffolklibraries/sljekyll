![Nat King Cole & Me, Colors](/images/featured/featured-music-october-2017.jpg)

## [Liam Gallagher - <cite>As You Were</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2279101)

First solo album from Liam following his work with his band Beady Eye. If you were an Oasis fan, or a Beatles fan for that matter, there is much to enjoy on the new album. 'For What it's worth' is late 1960s Beatles to a tee.

## [Robert Plant - <cite>Carry Fire</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2290299)

Robert Plant releases his 11th studio album. He is accompanied by his backers The Sensational Space Shifters from his last album [<cite>Lullaby and the Ceaseless Roar</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1660005).

For lovers of trivia, <cite>The May Queen</cite> on the album is a reference to the lyrics of <cite>Stairway to Heaven</cite>.

## [Gregory Porter - <cite>Nat "King" Cole & Me</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2298079)

If ever there was a sure thing, this is it. Grammy award winning vocalist Gregory Porter releases a tribute to his idol, the legendary singer Nat King Cole.

Porter's obsession with Nat King Cole dates back to when he was five. He wrote a song and put it on tape for his mother. His mother told him it sounded like Nat King Cole. This sent the young Gregory delving into her record collection and the rest is history.

## [The Darkness - <cite>Pinewood Smile</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2281299)

The Lowestoft band release their fifth album. Expect plenty of guitar riffs and Justin Hawkins' falsetto.

Rock fans of a certain age will be interested to hear that the band's new drummer Rufus Taylor is the son of Roger Taylor of Queen.

## [Beck - <cite>Colors</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2295892)

A lot of artists are happy to churn out variations on the same album time after time. Some artists get better and better. Beck is firmly in the latter category. <cite>Dear Life</cite> is a great song. This is definitely worth a listen.

## [St Vincent - <cite>Masseduction</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2303943)

"If you want to know about my life listen to this record".

St Vincent reveals all.

## [Neil Finn - <cite>Out of Silence</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2288302)

Strictly speaking, this was a September release but it would be a shame to miss it as Neil Finn is one of the greatest songwriters today. It is not long at 35 minutes, but if you are a fan of Crowded House you will find the usual subtlety and complex instrumentation.

If you have not heard any of Finn's material, either start here or with [<cite>The Very Very Best of Crowded House</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1558209).
