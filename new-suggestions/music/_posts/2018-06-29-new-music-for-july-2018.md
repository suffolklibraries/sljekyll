## [Florence + The Machine - <cite>High As Hope</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2424479)

Florence has moved seamlessly from the quirky performer we first saw surrounded on stage by bird cages and assorted paraphernalia to a fully fledged stadium filler. <cite>High As Hope</cite> continues her ascent.

## [Let's Eat Grandma - <cite>I'm All Ears</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2405349)

The Norwich synth duo really hit their stride on this stunningly original second LP. The album is produced by David Wrench, who has worked with the xx and Frank Ocean.

## [Ray Davies - <cite>Our Country: Americana Act II</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2422058)

The legendary voice of The Kinks has hit a rich new seam with his <cite>Americana</cite> work. <cite>Americana Act II</cite> riffs on his American influences and covers the incident when he was shot during a mugging in 2004. Despite the serious subject matter, there is plenty of his trademark wit and observation.

## [Wilko Johnson - <cite>Blow Your Mind</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2408410)

Wilko Johnson releases his first album of original new material since the 1980s.

## [Years & Years - <cite>Palo Santo</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2420468)

Plenty of great choruses on the follow up to their 2015 debut album [<cite>Communion</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1790245). This is more ‘pop’ than their earlier work and will be everywhere this summer.

## [Kamasi Washington - <cite>Heaven and Earth</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2409699)

Latest album from the saxophone virtuoso who has often been hailed as the saviour of modern jazz.
