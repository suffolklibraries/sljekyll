## [First Aid Kit - <cite>Ruins</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2328138)

Klara and Johanna's first album since 2014's [<cite>Stay Gold</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1619413) has a more rootsy sound. You can really hear the influences of musicians such as Gram Parsons, and members of REM, Midlake and Wilco guest on the album, but there are still plenty of harmonies to enjoy.

## [Craig David - <cite>The Time is Now</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2306213)

Surely winner of the award for greatest comeback, Craig David's new album features collaborations with Bastille, JP Cooper, AJ Tracey and more.

## [Various Artists - <cite>Highway to Hell: a tribute to Bon Scott & AC/DC 1974-1979</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2330525)

This tribute to the legendary Bon Scott, who died in 1980, features current and former members of AC/DC, Guns N Roses, Thin Lizzy, Skid Row, Alice Cooper, Black Star Riders, Ratt, Damn Yankees and AC/DC tribute bands from around the world. The recent death of Malcolm Young makes this album very timely.

## [Mary Black - <cite>Mary Black sings Jimmy MacCarthy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2342452)

For those of you who are unaware, Jimmy MacCarthy is Ireland’s nearest equivalent to Jimmy Webb, with Mary as his Glen Campbell. This album features two new MacCarthy compositions and a duet. This is a must-listen for anyone who enjoys Irish folk or even just beautiful melodies.

## [Frank Turner - <cite>Songbook</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2323487)

Frank Turner first came to wider notice when he played at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony. <cite>Songbook</cite> is a career-spanning collection with an additional disc of new versions of older material, as well as a new song.

## [Björk - <cite>Utopia</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2331731)

Björk never makes the same album twice and she doesn't play to the crowd either. This is definitely worth borrowing from the library and giving a few spins, but it won't be for everyone.
