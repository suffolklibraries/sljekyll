## [Rag 'n' Bone Man - <cite>Human</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2124642)

First album from the 2017 BRIT Awards Critics' Choice Award winner. The prize is usually a prelude to a glittering career. Previous winners of the award include Florence And The Machine, Jessie J, Emeli Sandé, Adele, Ellie Goulding, Tom Odell, and, last year, Sam Smith.

## [Sundara Karma - <cite>Youth is Only Ever Fun in Retrospect</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2066699)

2017 looks likely to be the year Oscar Pollock, androgynous frontman of Sundara Karma, becomes a major star. Big choruses and sold out small gigs have led to the band being championed by the mainstream taste makers.

## [Elbow - <cite>Little Fictions</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2125030)

Guy Garvey and co return for their seventh album. <cite>Little Fictions</cite> was produced by the band's own Craig Potter and sees them working with the Hallé Orchestra, the Hallé Ancoats Community Choir, members of London Contemporary Voices and session drummer Alex Reeves. Reeves has replaced longtime drummer Richard Jupp, who left recently.

## [Amy Macdonald - <cite>Under Stars</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2120833)

Amy MacDonald's first new album since 2012’s <cite>Life in a Beautiful Light</cite>. She has recently announced a 13 date UK tour for 2017 including a night at the Royal Albert Hall.

## [Black Star Riders - <cite>Heavy Fire</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2116897)

<cite>Heavy Fire</cite> is the follow up to BSR's acclaimed 2015 release <cite>The Killer Instinct</cite> and finds the quintet - frontman Ricky Warwick, guitarists Scott Gorham and Damon Johnson, bassist Robbie Crane and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso - in electric form, crashing through 10 tracks of swaggering, life-affirming hard rock.

## [Wilko Johnson - <cite>I Keep It To Myself: The Best of Wilko Johnson</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2129463)

Collected together for the first time on CD, the first of two volumes presenting the finest recordings of one of the most idiosyncratic and iconic guitarists in rock history, Wilko Johnson. Includes key tracks from both Wilko's time with Dr. Feelgood and his solo career.
