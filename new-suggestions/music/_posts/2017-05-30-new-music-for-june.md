## [Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie - <cite>Lindsey Buckingham; Christine McVie</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2188099)

This is probably the nearest you will get to a new Fleetwood Mac album for the moment. This album also includes Mick Fleetwood and John McVie as the rhythm section. Buckingham has described this as a 'duets' album. It should be an interesting listen. Last time these two worked together was in 1987 for <cite>Tango in the Night</cite>.

## [Fleet Foxes - <cite>Crack-up</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169853)

First new music from the Fleet Foxes since [<cite>Helplessness Blues</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=845883) in 2011.

All the songs on <cite>Crack-up</cite> are written by frontman Robin Pecknold. For years there has been a fan theory that the final song on <cite>Helplessness Blues</cite> ended too soon and that maybe <cite>Crack-Up</cite> will open with that missing chord, so that <cite>Helplessness Blues</cite> blends seamlessly into it. They even worked out that an F chord would bridge the gap nicely.

Unlikely as it sounds that a band would choose a specific note to connect albums made six years apart, Pecknold himself logged on to respond to the theory: "First note on new album is F for exactly this reason," he revealed in a response to the original post. "First main song chord is Bb / F for this reason too, never thought anyone would think about it besides me but you nailed it!"

## [Glen Campbell - <cite>Adiós</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2189705)

After his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2011, this was Campbell’s final trip to the studio. <cite>Adiós</cite> spotlights some of Campbell's favourite songs, most of which he had never recorded before. The album finishes with the heartbreaking <cite>Adiós</cite>, which, like three other songs, was written by legendary songwriter Jimmy Webb.

Because of Campbell’s illness some of the songs had to be recorded a line at a time and painstakingly put together. This is a late present for all Glen Campbell fans.

## [Lorde - <cite>Melodrama</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2170956)

Massively anticipated new album from the multi-talented New Zealand songstress who is still only 20. Lorde has described this as an album about being alone at a house party, the good and bad parts. She has been living with this album for a while, playing it on headphones so she will get the same experience as her fans.

[<cite>Pure Heroine</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1492908) and in particular <cite>Royals</cite> were career-defining for Lorde, so the pressure on her to deliver with this album will be immense.

## [Chuck Berry - <cite>Chuck</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2178656)

<cite>Chuck</cite> is the final album and first new recordings in nearly 40 years by the late rock and roll legend.

## [Royal Blood - <cite>How Did We Get So Dark?</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2188941)

More bass riffs and pounding rhythms from the Brighton duo.

## [alt-J - <cite>Relaxer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2172518)

It is probably an answer on <cite>Pointless</cite> now that alt–J won the Mercury Prize in 2012. [<cite>An Awesome Wave</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1312719) was a huge hit in 2012. Since then they have all been busy doing other things so it will be interesting to see how this one performs.

## [London Grammar - <cite>Truth is a Beautiful Thing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2180369)

Follow-up to London Grammar’s critically acclaimed 2013 platinum selling debut [<cite>If You Wait</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1470967). You may have seen them performing <cite>Stay Awake</cite> recently on Jools Holland’s show.

## [Dua Lipa - <cite>Dua Lipa</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2196262)

This is London born Dua Lipa's highly anticipated self-titled debut album. Co-written by Lipa with a raft of top notch songwriters, this is sure to be a hit.
