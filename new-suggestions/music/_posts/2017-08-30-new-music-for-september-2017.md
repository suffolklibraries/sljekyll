![The Punishment of Luxury, Native Invader](/images/featured/featured-music-september-2017.jpg)

## [The Killers - <cite>Wonderful Wonderful</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2279132)

Fifth studio album from Brandon Flowers and co. This is the band’s first album for five years. The first single release <cite>The Man</cite> is Bowie-inspired and should be a festival singalong.

## [Van Morrison - <cite>Roll with the Punches</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2277244)

Unbelievably this is Van Morrison’s 37th album. This one is a mixture of rhythm & blues classics and some new self-written material. The backing musicians are not bad either, with the likes of Georgie Fame, Chris Farlowe, Paul Jones and Jeff Beck contributing.

## [Yusuf - <cite>The Laughing Apple</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2273917)

Yusuf, or Cat Stevens as he was formerly known, still has a loyal following. On this album you will find new songs and covers. The twist in this case is that the covers are of Yusuf's own songs, presented as he wishes he had recorded them originally.

The album is produced with Paul Samwell-Smith, the original producer behind Yusuf’s legendary recordings, including 1970’s <cite>Tea for the Tillerman</cite>, which featured the classics <cite>Wild World</cite> and <cite>Father and Son</cite>.

## [Motörhead - <cite>Under Cöver</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2279429)

As the title suggests, this is an album of cover versions. If you have always wanted to hear Lemmy’s take on Bowie’s <cite>Heroes</cite> or The Ramones' <cite>Rockaway Beach</cite>, this is for you.

## [OMD - <cite>The Punishment of Luxury</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2202617)

If you thought OMD were lost somewhere in the 80s, here is their latest album – their 13th. As ever, the band centres around Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphries. If you were a fan in the 80s you will find much that is familiar. Some of the biggest bands of the moment like The Killers and the xx have cited OMD as an inspiration.

## [Foo Fighters - <cite>Concrete and Gold</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2258366)

Foo Fighters release their ninth record. Some of it will be familiar if you watched their headlining set at Glastonbury. <cite>Run</cite> has already been released if you want to get a taste of the new material.

## [Tori Amos - <cite>Native Invader</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2278039)

Latest album from the singer-songwriter. The record looks at Nature and how she heals herself. The songs also wrestle with the question: what is our part in the destruction of our land, as well as ourselves, and in our relationships with each other?

## [Wolf Alice - <cite>Visions of a Life</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2277245)

Wolf Alice are currently poised on the brink of superstardom. After the runaway success of their debut [<cite>My Love Is Cool</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1801189), this should cement their position as a stadium filling band.
