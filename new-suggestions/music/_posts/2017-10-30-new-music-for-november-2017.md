## [Sam Smith - <cite>The Thrill of It All</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317098)

This second studio album from Sam Smith follows the massively successful [<cite>In the Lonely Hour</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1566673), which sold over 12 million copies. Produced by Jimmy Napes, who co-produced much of <cite>In the Lonely Hour</cite>.

## [Taylor Swift - <cite>Reputation</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2298077)

Long-awaited and anticipated, Taylor's sixth album includes the number one single <cite>Look What You Made Me Do</cite>.

## [Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds - <cite>Who Built the Moon?</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2311332)

Noel's new album features appearances by Paul Weller and Johnny Marr. This is his most experimental work to date, featuring instrumentals and samples instead of his usual electric guitar sound.

## [Morrissey - <cite>Low in High School</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2310245)

Morrissey reluctantly engages again with the music industry for his first new material since 2014. He was recently quoted as saying, 'there was a time when the music industry served the artist but now the artist must serve the music industry, which is why everything is now so tasteless.'

## [Maroon 5 - <cite>Red Pill Blues</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317102)

Featuring the band's recent single, <cite>What Lovers Do</cite>, featuring SZA, as well as collaborationd with A$AP Rocky, Julia Michaels and LunchMoney Lewis.

## [Paloma Faith - <cite>The Architect</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2310260)

Paloma's fourth album includes collaborations with John Legend, Sia, Rag'n'Bone Man and even Samuel L. Jackson.
