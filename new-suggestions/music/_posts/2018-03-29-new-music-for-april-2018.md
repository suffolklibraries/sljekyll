## [Jack White - <cite>Boarding House Reach</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2377577)

First all-new album from the former White Stripes frontman for nearly four years. <cite>Boarding House Reach</cite> was recorded in spartan surroundings with minimal distractions using the most basic instrumentation.

## [George Ezra - <cite>Staying at Tamara's</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2391071)

This album is inspired by Ezra's travels. Places he stayed included a Norfolk pig farm and the Barcelona Airbnb that gives the LP its bizarre name. This is music to chase away the winter blues.

## [Manic Street Preachers - <cite>Resistance is Futile</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2391070)

The Manics return with an album of songs mostly about people. Subjects include Dylan Thomas, David Bowie and street photographer Vivian Maier.

## [Goat Girl - <cite>Goat Girl</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2381305)

Debut album from the band at the centre of the ‘South London scene’. If you haven’t heard them before, expect post-punk vocals with country tinged guitar riffs.

## [The Vaccines - <cite>Combat Sports</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2343274)

Fourth album from the indie guitar band. This promises brash, bold, rock and roll songs that mix melancholy and euphoria.

## [Eels - <cite>The Deconstruction</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2376956)

Mark Everett returns with his trademark brutally honest lyrics and hummable tunes.

## [Hinds - <cite>I Don't Run</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2369483)

Jangly lo-fi pop from the Spanish indie outfit.

## [Willie Nelson - <cite>Last Man Standing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2384825)

The country music legend turns 85 this year. The title is a humorous comment on recent rumours about his health.
