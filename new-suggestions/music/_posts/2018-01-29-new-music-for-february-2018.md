![Always Ascending, Open Here](/images/featured/featured-music-february-2018.jpg)

## [Franz Ferdinand - <cite>Always Ascending</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2330444)

Long awaited fifth studio album from the band who are re-inventing themselves with a new line-up after the departure of original member Nick McCarthy. There is more synth and less guitars on this one and critically Alex Kapranos is on good form lyrically.

## [Field Music - <cite>Open Here</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2341725)

Field Music are the Brewis brothers from Sunderland. They already have a lot of devotees, including Vic Reeves. Prince even tweeted about one of their singles, back in 2015. The problem is they have not hit the mainstream after five albums.

There are inevitably Steely Dan comparisons but you can also hear the influences of XTC on this record. While this album is unlikely to trouble Taylor Swift and co at the top of the charts, it is proof that there is a lot of good music being made out there.

## [U.S. Girls - <cite>In a Poem Unlimited</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2346928)

This one is a bit different. The subject matter is thought-provoking, including domestic violence and vulnerable people in society, but it is wrapped in lush pop melodies.

## [Ezra Furman - <cite>Transangelic Exodus</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2330434)

If you have never heard anything by Ezra Furman, think Jonathan Richman/Velvet Underground. This is hopefully the album which will see him reach a wider audience.

## [Joan As Police Woman - <cite>Damned Devotion</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2341731)

Singer/songwriter Joan Wasser is JAPW. If you would like a taste of this, check out <cite>Warning Bell</cite> and <cite>Silly Me</cite> online.
