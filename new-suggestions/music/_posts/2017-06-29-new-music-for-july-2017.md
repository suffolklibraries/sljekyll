![Arcade Fire, Lucy Rose](/images/featured/featured-music-july-2017.jpg)

## [Arcade Fire - <cite>Everything Now</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2245244)

The album was co-produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, Pulp bassist Steve Mackey, and Markus Dravs, who has co-produced Arcade Fire's past three albums, so it looks to have a good pedigree. First single <cite>Everything Now</cite> has already been released and the band have been out and about promoting the album at the Isle of Wight Festival, Edinburgh and er... Scunthorpe.

## [Public Serving Broadcasting - <cite>Every Valley</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186283)

On a slightly smaller scale PSB return with a third album. <cite>Every Valley</cite> was inspired by the traditions surrounding British coal mining. It concentrates on abandoned and neglected communities across the western world, and the politics that have arisen as a result.

## [Lucy Rose - <cite>Something's Changing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2178591)

The British singer/songwriter Lucy Rose recently took her guitar and backpacked across South and Central America, writing songs as she travelled and stayed with fans performing free shows as she went. This album is the result.

## [Paul Heaton & Jacqui Abbott - <cite>Crooked Calypso</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2250403)

Follow up to [<cite>What Have We Become</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1588125) and [<cite>Wisdom, Laughter & Lines</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1872927) sees the two former Beautiful South stars re-united. There is likely to be a tour soon to promote the new album.

## [Calvin Harris - <cite>Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2201621)
