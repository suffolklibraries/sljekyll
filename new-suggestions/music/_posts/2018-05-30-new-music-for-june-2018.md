## [LUMP - <cite>LUMP</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2409775)

Not the most inspired of names for a group but this is a collaboration between mega-selling folk star Laura Marling and Mike Lindsay (Tunng). You can catch them at Latitude in July.

## [Roger Daltrey - <cite>As Long as I Have You</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2396748)

Long before The Who became successful they were playing soul and blues. This album sees Daltrey going back to his roots to play nine cover versions and two original tunes. At 74, Daltrey has now grown into the blues voice he aspired to in those early days.

## [Janelle Monáe - <cite>Dirty Computer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2391402)

This is an early contender for the 'album of the year' lists. There are echoes of Prince here and there is a similarly uninhibited attitude to sexuality. All this and Brian Wilson on the title track.

## [Father John Misty - <cite>God's Favorite Customer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2415274)

Fourth album from the former Fleet Fox. Songs like <cite>Please Don’t Die</cite> mark this out as what he has called a ‘heartache album’ but look closer and you will find the usual wit and wordplay.

## [Belly - <cite>Dove</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2391773)

This is the first album in 23 years from Tanya Donnelly and co and follows their recent reunion gigs.

## [Jorja Smith - <cite>Lost & Found</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2416435)

Much-anticipated debut from the 20-year-old singer-songwriter. <cite>Lost & Found</cite> includes previously released singles <cite>Blue Lights</cite>, <cite>Teenage Fantasy</cite> and <cite>Where Did I Go?</cite>.

## [Snow Patrol - <cite>Wildness</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2395488)

Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has been on a gruelling personal journey since the band’s last album in 2011. Thankfully he seems to have emerged and this album is the result. He recently played a track from the new album on <cite>Later... with Jools Holland</cite>.
