![Courtney Marie Andrews, The Breeders](/images/featured/featured-music-march-2018.jpg)

## [David Byrne - <cite>American Utopia</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2363601)

At last, a solo album from the former Talking Heads frontman. For fans, this links to 2008's <cite>Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</cite> with Brian Eno, as Eno also contributes here. It is always a joy to hear new music from Byrne and this is no exception. It has been worth the wait.

## [Wild Beasts - <cite>Last Night All My Dreams Came True</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2351841)

This live-in-the-studio album is Wild Beasts' last. They seem destined to be a band that are loved by some and unappreciated by others. Spanning their five-LP career, this will give you an idea of what you have missed.

## [Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Swears - <cite>Tearing at the Seams</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2373954)

Anyone who watches <cite>Later... With Jools Holland</cite> will be familiar with Rateliff’s track <cite>S.O.B.</cite> and his last album, which channelled the spirit of vintage Stax Records. This new album gives more of a feel of his riotous live performances.

## [Courtney Marie Andrews - <cite>May Your Kindness Remain</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2364189)

If you haven’t heard of her, Courtney Marie Andrews is the finest young singer-songwriter in America™ and numbers Elton John among her fans. <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> have compared her to Joni Mitchell, but she is probably nearer to Emmylou Harris vocally, which is not a bad starting point.

Courtney is touring the UK in April - catch her now before she becomes a huge star.

## [The Breeders - <cite>All Nerve</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2365263)

This is the first Breeders album in a decade and features the classic line up that recorded <cite>Last Splash</cite>. Groups getting together after a long break is not always a great idea, but this is really good.

## [Moby - <cite>Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2353475)

Moby’s new album is a return to the gospel and trip-hop style of his earlier work, including the 1999 classic <cite>Play</cite>.

## [Wiley - <cite>Godfather II</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2334832)

Everyone thought [<cite>Godfather</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078178), but here is <cite>Godfather II</cite> from the 'Godfather of Grime'.

## [MGMT - <cite>Little Dark Age</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2369418)

MGMT famously had huge success with their first album <cite>Oracular Spectacular</cite> in 2008, which included the anthem <cite>Time to Pretend</cite>. They had the world at their feet then threw it away by releasing a follow-up that alienated most of their fanbase. Now amazingly they are back and so are the melodies. This is excellent.
