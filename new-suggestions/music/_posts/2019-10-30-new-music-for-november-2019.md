![Angel Olsen, Jeff Lynne's ELO](/images/featured/featured-music-november-2019.jpg)

## [Jeff Lynne's ELO - <cite>From Out of Nowhere</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2681969)

ELO are many peopleâ€™s secret favourite band. On this album, as with their last in 2015, Jeff Lynne plays and contributes to almost every note.

## [The Who - <cite>Who</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2677880)

A late candidate for the most difficult item to find on our catalogue, The Who return with their first album since 2006. Frontman Roger Daltrey says this is their best album since [<cite>Quadrophenia</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=980949).

## [Van Morrison - <cite>Three Chords & the Truth</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2678040)

At 74, Van Morrison shows no signs of slowing down. <cite>Three Chords</cite> is his sixth album in four years. All the songs are written by Morrison, including <cite>If We Wait for Mountains</cite>, which he co-wrote with Don Black.

## [Freddie Mercury - <cite>Never Boring</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2671848)

Solo hits and other material are included on this tribute to Freddie.

## [Angel Olsen - <cite>All Mirrors</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2658366)

If you have heard <cite>Lark</cite> and <cite>All Mirrors</cite>, you are likely to be eagerly waiting for this one. An amazing voice.

## [Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - <cite>Ghosteen</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2681802)

Personal and intimate album as the singer tries to come to terms with loss.
