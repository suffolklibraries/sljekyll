## [Lewis Capaldi - <cite>Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2569088)

Scottish singer/songwriter continues his unerring rise to stardom by releasing his first album.

## [Morrissey - <cite>California Sun</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2578362)

The controversial former Smiths frontman returns with an album of covers by artists as diverse as Bob Dylan, Dionne Warwick and Roy Orbison.

## [Vampire Weekend - <cite>Father of the Bride</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2578207)

Keyboardist and producer Rostam Batmanglij has left the band, signalling a change in direction. Ezra Koenigâ€™s voice and guitar still dominate but there are a few surprises in store for longtime fans.

## [Aldous Harding - <cite>Designer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2573393)

Indie folk with a dark undertow.

## [Steve Earle & The Dukes - <cite>Guy</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2570037)

Guy Clark was one of the figures who inspired Steve Earle as a young man. The 16 tracks on this album are a fitting tribute to Clark, who died in 2016.
