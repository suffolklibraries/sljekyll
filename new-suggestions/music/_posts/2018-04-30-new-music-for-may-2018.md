![Arctic Monkeys, CHVRCHES](/images/featured/featured-music-may-2018.jpg)

## [Arctic Monkeys - <cite>Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2407844)

The standout title on this month's list. The sixth studio album from Arctic Monkeys is their first new material in five years and has been eagerly awaited by fans.

## [James Bay - <cite>Electric Light</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2394828)

Bay, now minus his trademark hat and sporting a short haircut, signals a new direction in his music. There is even an excerpt from Allen Ginsberg’s love poem <cite>Song</cite> at the album’s close.

## [Plan B - <cite>Heaven Before All Hell Breaks Loose</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2330437)

Fans of Ben Drew, aka Plan B, tend to fall into two camps. There are those who champion his earlier hip-hop and those newer fans who came on board when he took a more soulful direction with <cite>The Defamation of Strickland Banks</cite>. This album is neither of those. There is hardly any rapping and it is closer to Rag’n’Bone Man than <cite>Strickland</cite>.

## [Isaac Gracie - <cite>Isaac Gracie</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2387507)

What started out as an Internet sensation is now a fully fledged debut album. <cite>Last Words</cite> was the song that started the ball rolling. You will find that here alongside other strong tracks like <cite>Terrified</cite>.

## [Laura Veirs - <cite>The Lookout</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2388673)

10th solo album from Laura Veirs. Anyone who was alerted to her talent by the 2016 album [<cite>case/lang/veirs</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1986562) is likely to enjoy this one.

## [CHVRCHES - <cite>Love is Dead</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2391416)

Third album from the Glasgow synth pop trio. Matt Berninger from The National has also contributed.
