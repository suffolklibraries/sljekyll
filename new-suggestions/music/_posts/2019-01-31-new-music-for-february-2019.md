Sharon Van Etten's last album, [<cite>Are We There</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1598088), topped many ‘best of the year’ lists for 2014, so <cite>Remind Me Tomorrow</cite> is eagerly awaited.

This is an album of covers but it features old obscure blues songs that have hardly been covered.
