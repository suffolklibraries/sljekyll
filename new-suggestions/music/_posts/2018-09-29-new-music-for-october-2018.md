## [Cher - <cite>Dancing Queen</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2477462)

Cher recently appeared in <cite>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</cite>, so an album of ABBA covers is a natural progression. This will be very popular.

## [Nile Rodgers & Chic - <cite>It's About Time</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2454731)

A recent visitor to Suffolk for one of the Newmarket Nights, Nile Rodgers returns with Chic for the group’s first album for 25 years.

## [Elvis Costello & The Imposters - <cite>Look Now</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2468824)

After his recent health scare, Elvis Costello returns with the first record he’s made with The Imposters since 2008 and his first new album since 2013.

## [Willie Nelson - <cite>My Way</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2464194)

Frank Sinatra tribute album from the 85 year old Country music legend.

## [Richard Ashcroft - <cite>Natural Rebel</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2477477)

Ten new songs from the former frontman of The Verve.

## [alt-J - <cite>Reduxer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2464276)

Remixed version of [<cite>Relaxer</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2172518) featuring the likes of Pusha-T and Danny Brown.

## [Paul Weller - <cite>True Meanings</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2460458)

Paul Weller has always tried to something different. On <cite>True Meanings</cite>, the opening track is written by Villagers’ Conor O’Brien and there are nods to folk-soul. His albums are always worth a listen and this is no exception.
