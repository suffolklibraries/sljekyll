![Blondie, Hurray for the Riff Raff](/images/featured/featured-music-may-2017.jpg)

## [Blondie - <cite>Pollinator</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2151272)

This one has been described as 'old school' by the band. If you have heard the first single <cite>Fun</cite>, it sounds like it could have been on the track list of 1978's <cite>Plastic Letters</cite> or <cite>Parallel Lines</cite>.

There is also a star studded list of collaborators on this album. Guest contributors include Sia who wrote <cite>Best Day Ever</cite>, which features guitar work by The Strokes’ Nick Valensi. Charli XCX helped out on <cite>Gravity</cite>, and Johnny Marr is on <cite>My Monster</cite>. Elsewhere, Joan Jett sings on <cite>Doom Or Destiny</cite>. If that is not enough for you, Laurie Anderson pops up on a secret track also written by Charli XCX, titled <cite>Tonight</cite>.

## [Gorllaz - <cite>Humanz</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2179594)

Damon Albarn returns in one of his old guises with a party record about the world falling apart. There are plenty of vocalists to help things along including Mavis Staples and Mercury Prize winner Benjamin Clementine. There is also the spectacle of Grace Jones playing a villain on <cite>Charger</cite>. Savages singer Jehnny Beth also features, on <cite>We Got The Power</cite>.

## [BNQT - <cite>Volume 1</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2180384)

This band is pronounced 'banquet'. It centres around Eric Pulido from Midlake and vocalists include Alex Kapranos (Franz Ferdinand), Fran Healy (Travis) and Jason Lytle (Grandaddy). If you like any of these bands this is worth a listen.

## [Hurray for the Riff Raff - <cite>The Navigator</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2123308)

I’m not sure how best to describe this one. It is kind of a folk concept album, if such a thing exists.

Alynda Segarra, the creative force behind the band, grew up obsessed with <cite>West Side Story</cite> until she discovered Bikini Kill. Segarra tells a story through her alter ego, a Puerto Rican street kid named Navi. The result is a two 'act' album with Puerto Rican sounds and some spoken word thrown in. Even at this early stage it is likely to feature in many of the 'best of' lists for 2017.

## [Diana Krall - <cite>Turn Up The Quiet</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2160048)

<cite>Turn Up The Quiet</cite> is Krall's 13th studio album and marks her return to jazz with standards like Cole Porter’s <cite>Night And Day</cite>. This album reunites her with Tommy LiPuma who has produced her most successful work.

## [Nick Cave - <cite>Lovely Creatures</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2169824)

This is not new material but a best of. Let’s let Nick Cave describe the album for himself:

> "There are some people out there who just don’t know where to start with The Bad Seeds. Others know the catalogue better than I do! This release is designed to be a way into three decades of music making. That’s a lot of songs.

> "The songs we have chosen are the ones that have stuck around, for whatever reason. Some songs are those that demand to be played live. Others are lesser songs that are personal favourites of ours. Others are just too big and have too much history to leave out. And there are those that didn’t make it, poor things. They are the ones you must discover by yourselves."

## [Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers - <cite>Psychotic Reaction</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2168402)

1991 broadcast from the <cite>Into The Great Wide Open</cite> tour.

On 24th November 1991, the band performed at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in California, a show which was the subject of an FM radio broadcast, transmitted live across the state, and which is now presented on this CD in its full version. The band draw largely on material from <cite>Full Moon Fever</cite> and <cite>Into The Great Wide Open</cite>, including all five of Petty's recent hits, plus a decent selection of covers.
