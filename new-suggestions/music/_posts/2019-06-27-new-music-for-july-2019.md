## [Ed Sheeran - <cite>No. 6 Collaborations Project</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2616243)

The fourth full-length studio album from the Framlingham singer-songwriter, following on the heels of his Grammy-winning album [<cite>รท</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=981783), released in 2017. The album features collaborations with Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and PnB Rock, and many more.

## [Freya Ridings - <cite>Freya Ridings</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2537220)

Freya is a rising star who has rather unfairly been tagged 'the new Adele', or at least a superstar in waiting. Judge for yourself with her first studio album.

## [The Flaming Lips - <cite>King's Mouth Music and Songs</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2600826)

A former Record Day limited edition release which is now available for all to listen to.

## [Kaiser Chiefs - <cite>Duck</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2619877)

The band return to their musical roots for their seventh studio album. There will be a stadium tour to support the release.

## [Bastille - <cite>Doom Days</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2606392)

Third album from Bastille. This is not as anthemic as the other two but there should be enough tunes on here to satisfy most of their fans.

## [The Black Keys - <cite>Let's Rock</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2602026)

Five years on from their last album, Carney and Auerbach return. As usual nothing was written before going into the studio, but the old magic is there. Play loud.

## [Of Monsters and Men - <cite>Fever Dream</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2610156)

Third album from the much-acclaimed Icelandic band.
