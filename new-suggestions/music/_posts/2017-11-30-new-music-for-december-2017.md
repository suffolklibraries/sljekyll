![Jeff Lynne's ELO, The Rolling Stones](/images/featured/featured-music-december-2017.jpg)

## [U2 - <cite>Songs of Experience</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2332452)

The 14th studio album by U2 is a companion piece to their last album, [<cite>Songs of Innocence</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1697288). <cite>Songs of Experience</cite> is based on a collection of letters written by frontman Bono to people and places closest to his heart.

## [Van Morrison - <cite>Versatile</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2333344)

A mere three months after his last album, [<cite>Roll with the Punches</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2277244), Van Morrison returns with some new material. While <cite>Roll with the Punches</cite> was made up of blues standards mixed with new songs, <cite>Versatile</cite> comprises jazz standards and mew songs. There are interpretations of songs by Gershwin and Cole Porter and a song featuring Sir James Galway.

## [Jools Holland & José Feliciano - <cite>As You See Me Now</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2310234)

This came out in mid November, but it is well worth a mention. It includes covers of a wide range of artists including Stevie Wonder, Lead Belly and Percy Mayfield, as well as new versions of José Feliciano's international hits such as <cite>Let's Find Each Other Tonight</cite> and <cite>One More Drink</cite> and a ska makeover of festive favourite <cite>Feliz Navidad</cite>.

## [Jeff Lynne's ELO - <cite>Wembley or Bust</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317117)

<cite>Wembley or Bust</cite> is a recording of a concert by Jeff Lynne's version of ELO at Wembley in July 2017. There are also songs from Lynne's time with The Move and The Traveling Wilburys.

## [The Rolling Stones - <cite>On Air</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2317094)

A collection of BBC recordings from the 1960s which offer a unique insight into the formative days of The Rolling Stones. As well as the usual classics, you can hear some blues, R&B and even country from long forgotten shows such as <cite>Saturday Club</cite> and <cite>The Joe Loss Pop Show</cite>.
