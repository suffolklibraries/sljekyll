## Picture books for pre school age

### [<cite>That dog!</cite>](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6518249?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1391765)&QRYTEXT=That%20dog!) by Gillian Shields

The eponymous dog leaves his mean minded family to seek his fortune on the stage. Much more fun!

### [<cite>Scruffy Bear and the lost ball</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800138?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1168394)&QRYTEXT=Scruffy%20Bear%20and%20the%20lost%20ball) by Christopher Wormell

Missing the John Lewis advert already and longing to see more rabbits and a bear? Then here’s the perfect picture book.

## Short chapter books for young independent readers

### [<cite>Queen Bee!</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800522?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35039959)&QRYTEXT=Queen%20bee!) by Alan McDonald

Angela Nicely is a feisty new heroine from the author of the very popular Dirty Bertie series. Good news for little girls!

### [<cite>Choosing Crumble</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800840?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32043877)&QRYTEXT=Choosing%20Crumble) by Michael Rosen

Actually it’s the dog, Crumble, who does the choosing and it was Tony Ross who drew him. Bound to be good for a laugh.

## Junior novels for more confident readers

### [<cite>Baby aliens got my teacher</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5801067?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(23531374)&QRYTEXT=Baby%20aliens%20got%20my%20teacher) by Pamela Butchart

Why is Miss Jones being nice all of a sudden? There’s only one explanation!

### [<cite>Knightley and son</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5801405?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(21833228)&QRYTEXT=Knightley%20and%20Son) by Rohan Gavin

A fast paced mystery adventure about a father/son detective team. I hope this is the start of a new series. Definitely one to look out for.

## Teen novels

### [<cite>Noble Conflict</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5801609?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25297198)&QRYTEXT=Noble%20conflict) by Malorie Blackman

Written by the current Children’s Laureate <cite>Noble Conflict</cite> is an edge of your seater, with ethics. Brilliant.

If you missed this when it came out in hardback in 2013, put your name down for the new paperback edition to carry you into January.
