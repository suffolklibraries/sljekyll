      Eliza, a young rabbit, discovers the funny little creature who has been stealing her books. In a remarkable act of generosity, she offers to read him a nightly bedtime story so he can forsake his life of crime whilst still enjoying books. Now if there had been a public library in Eliza’s wood, the Snatchabook could have joined, borrowed all the books he could read for free and gone along to storytimes and Tot Rock too.

      Bear has 7 books already, so why does he need to go the library? When he gets there (cajoled by his friend Mouse) he overhears a story time and is seduced. Bonny Becker’s other picture books about Bear and Mouse are well worth hunting out if you haven’t come across them before. We have them all because we are a library, and you may borrow them for free, just like Bear. This paperback edition came out in November 2015.

      Now we were very pleased to see Emily Gravett’s masterpiece about the book loving rabbit reissued last year for its 10th anniversary. However, if you are of a squeamish disposition, you may not be as pleased as we were, and may not want to find out what happens to the poor little rabbit when the wolves in his library book come alive.

      We really wish the librarian in this story didn’t say “Shhhhh!” (none of the staff in Suffolk Libraries would ever say such a thing) but we know all those Sarah and Duck enthusiasts will not unable to resist borrowing this cute little book, so we bought lots of copies.

      Originally published in 2005 and reissued in 2015, this is a powerful story about a boy who hates school, being drawn into a magical world when he listens to story at the local library. It’s a wonderful book, quite short at only 112 pages, but it packs quite a punch. The exquisite illustrations are by Gary Blythe.
