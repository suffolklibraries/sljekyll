      Taking a baby to the seaside this summer? This lovely lift-the-flap board book is just the ticket. Not taking a baby to the seaside this summer? I bet you’ll like it too. In fact, so many people in Suffolk like this book, we’ve had to buy more copies!

      A sturdy little board book which includes some very attractive black and white photos of babies. The mirrored end page is bound to be popular for any baby playing peek-a-boo; perhaps the baby equivalent of a selfie?

    <p>
      Subtitled “a tall tale of a small frog”, this is a wonderfully ludicrous version of <cite>The Frog Prince</cite>, but without the kiss and with a dragon for good measure. The narrative simply flows through the rhyming text and Sara Ogilvie’s illustrations are a delight.

      I love stories with bossy little girls as the protagonist, and luckily for me, there are so many. Here is a classic in the making. This delightfully Africanised retake of <cite>Little Red Riding Hood</cite> is packed with visual humour and smashing to read aloud.

      A tender and sensitive portrayal of the overwhelming sense of rejection and bewilderment a new baby can bring. For poor little Atinuke, the pain seems doubled because her mum just had twins, so all the adults in her life are too busy for her. A beautiful book with a warm resolution; it brought tears to my eyes!

      We’ve been waiting to read the next hilarious episode in the life of Emily Sparkes and here it is. Brainchild of local author Ruth Fitzgerald, Emily is a well-intentioned but hapless heroine. She entered her mum in a “Mum in a million competition”, but couldn’t have imagined in her worst nightmare that she would actually be shortlisted. I mean really, her mum is soooo embarrassing.

      Jonny Jakes investigates dodgy hamburgers being handed out by a suspiciously alien looking head teacher in this first book of a new series by a debut author. It’s funny, well written and quite simply, brilliant. I reckon Jonny Jakes would get on well with Greg Heffley. I hope it’s not too long before the next instalment.

      A gem of a book, first published in the US back in 1967. Republished now by Pushkin books, this beautifully written adventure story features two children, who having run away to the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/~/media/Files/Learn/Family%20Map%20and%20Guides/MuseumKids/The%20Mixed%20Up%20Files%20Issue.pdf">Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York</a> become involved in a mystery.

    <p>
      I never got round to reading this amazing book when it was first published in 2004 and to be honest I think the difficult subject matter put me off. When JJ was 10, she killed a school friend and spent the next few years in a Young Offenders Institution. As the story starts, JJ has been released and is starting a new life with an assumed identity under the care of a social worker. The novel is totally absorbing, raises loads of important questions, for example about culpability, blame, redemption, and press freedom, but offers no easy answers. I got hooked on it and went straight on to the sequel <cite>Finding Jennifer Jones</cite>. Brilliant books, both of them and perfect in this eAudio format.

      High quality glossy photography, good clear captions, lots of facts set out like top trumps, a ton of sharks and some very weird looking &#8216;things&#8217;. Hope your arms are strong enough to carry it home from the library.

      221 pages of fun facts. For example, on page 90; “Vending machines kill 4 times more people each year than sharks”. On page 61, “The Ancient Aztecs ate tortillas stuffed with tadpoles for dinner.” It’s square and easy to read, with lots of photos on matte paper. But don’t look for explanations because it’s just facts. And it’s addictive. Page 103 “Cows can be identified by their noseprints.” See?
