    <p>
      Bruno is the latest relative to be introduced in the <cite>My Freaky Family</cite> series, currently being re-issued by Orchard Books after a break of many years. Excellent for young collectors (if you are a collector, Brave Bruno has a coach load of alliterative relatives, Mucky Micky, Rude Ruby, Tiny Tina to name but 4), for Tony Ross addicts, and for children whose own families can’t bear them to read another book about a certain horrid boy who shall remain nameless.

    <p>
      Just in time for autumn comes this nice little book for children just starting to read by themselves. The illustrations are &#8216;staged&#8217; photographic and rather appealing, whereas the hat is a matter of opinion. In Bob’s opinion, it’s horrible.

    <p>
      The second title in Gill Lewis’ <cite>Puppy Academy</cite> series is this delightful tear jerker for puppy lovers, (and lovers of little lambs too.) Sarah Horne’s illustrations hit just the right note of pathos and humour, and I love the bones at the foot of each page!

      “Feo lives in the snowbound woods of Russia, in a house full of food and fireplaces. Ten minutes away, in a ruined chapel, lives a pack of wolves. Her mother is a wolf wilder, and Feo is a wolf wilder in training. A wolf wilder is the opposite of an animal tamer: it is a person who teaches tamed animals to fend for themselves, and to fight and to run, and to be wary of humans.” Set during the Russian Revolution, this is a challenging read for Years 6 to 8.

      There is a line of humour running throughout this new title by Patrick Ness. Juxtaposed against and almost despite the backdrop of “normal” teens with their normal angsts are a series of supernatural manifestations; you know, “zombies, soul-eating ghosts” and whatever. I couldn’t help imagining the characters played by younger versions of David Mitchell, Hugh Dennis et al. In fact I think a film of this book is already overdue!
