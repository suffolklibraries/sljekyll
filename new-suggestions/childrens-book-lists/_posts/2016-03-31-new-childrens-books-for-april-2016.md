      This is a brilliant board book, fresh from the US best-seller charts. It’s a rhyming road-trip of a book, begging to be read in a square-dance-drawl. If only it were nearly Christmas I’d give it to every family of every toddler I know!

      You may have met Knitbone Pepper in 2015, when his first novel came out. If so, you’ll remember how he and Winnie helped her parents gets loads of money to save their beloved Starcross Hall. If you didn’t, I suggest you read that one first, before embarking on this second crazy adventure. If you did, read this next because there are even more ghosts, Knitbone P is as heroic as ever, the book is lovely to hold and the illustrations are perfect.

      A mystery set on the south coast in the 1920s, in which 3 children foil a plan to steal people’s life savings. Jointly narrated by the children, Nancy a housemaid, who records her thoughts and events in her journal, Ella the solitary daughter of an American archaeologist and by Quentin, an unwilling scholar sent for extra tuition with a vicar, it’s delightfully old fashioned and a “jolly good read”.

      The miniature dragon from the title arrives unexpectedly in a box of bean sprouts from the Chinese take away, and that’s when life becomes chaotic. Packed with humorous illustrations by Sarah Horne, this fast-paced book is hilarious. It’s always exciting to find a funny new series of books for children in KS2 (we’ve ordered the next title <cite>Dragon in my backpack</cite> due out in May.) particularly one that appeals alike to both boys and girls.

      This gripping sci-fi thriller by a talented new author is set in a post-apocalyptic community led by &#8220;The Saviour&#8221;. In this divisive world, medieval in its cruelty, twins (&#8220;idents&#8221;) are ostracised and feared. The story opens at the annual Peace Fair, attendance compulsory, where caged idents are tortured to reveal the one real human. Kyle the central character, appalled by the cruelty he sees, is attacked as he travels home and his life changes forever. Brilliant characterisation and fast-paced action make this an enticing start to a new series.
