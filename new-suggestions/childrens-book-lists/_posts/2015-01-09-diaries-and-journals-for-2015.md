    <p>
      What a lie! Little Wolf has not written a diary at all. He has written loads and loads and loads of letters to his mum and dad. But they are jolly good to read, particularly with his phonetic spellings. Oh, and Tony Ross’ illustrations of course.

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      The diary documents a year in the life of a young woman driving an ambulance in France during WWI. The expressive narrative should enrich learning from non-fiction books on the subject.

### [<cite>The Isobel Journal</cite> by Isobel Harrop](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2887664?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(27169292)&QRYTEXT=The%20Isobel%20journal%20%3A%20just%20a%20Northern%20girl%20from%20where%20nothing%20really%20happens)

  </div>

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      Scrapbook documenting the life of the teenage author. It’s rather like <cite>Wreck this journal</cite>, but already filled in. It’s very funny and I loved it.

### [<cite>I capture the castle</cite> by Dodie Smith](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2891277?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(462801)&QRYTEXT=I%20capture%20the%20castle)

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      First published in 1949, it’s still delighting readers 65 years later. It often appears in lists of favourite books and has a local connection too; Dodie Smith once lived near Sudbury and the movie version was filmed at Framlingham Castle.

### [<cite>The Dirt Diary</cite> by Anna Staniszewski](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2893423?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(45373459)&QRYTEXT=Dirt%20Diary)

  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p>
      This diary is a salvation, and then a liability. 13 year old Rachel’s life hits a new low when her mum sets up a cleaning business employing just her and gets even worse when she has to clean the houses of all her school mates. Her life begins to look up when she captures their secrets in her newly named “dirt diary”. It’s very funny and would make a brilliant film.

      Based on a multi-platform adaptation of <cite>Pride & Prejudice</cite>. You may already have seen it on YouTube or Tumblr, but if not, watch this then read the book. The Guardian says they “like to think that if Austen were alive now, she might have created something very like this”.
