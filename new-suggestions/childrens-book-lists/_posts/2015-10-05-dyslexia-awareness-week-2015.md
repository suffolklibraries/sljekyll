## Ludicrous delightful picture books for any age, from 3 to 83!

Both these brilliant books are packed full of phonic silliness, perfect to laugh at and relax with!

## Joke books

Joke books are brilliant for children who find reading a struggle or boring; short punchy sentences, lots of illustrations, a captive audience and usually, very poor taste!

## Poems

The rhyming text in poetry is great for dyslexic children, because it helps them to predict the words. Children who lack &#8216;reading stamina&#8217; won’t flag in the middle or reading a poem, so they could get to finish reading a whole something, without prompts, persuasion or coercion. Most of the poems in these two books are also very funny!

## Factual books

Don’t forget that our libraries are crammed full of brilliant information books. We’ve got tons of books about dinosaurs, pirates, football, kittens and more. For a real reading reward, why not borrow one of these cookery books? Your dyslexic child can read the ingredients and follow the instructions, then get to eat the results of their labours.
