      This little board book is pleasing to read and beautifully produced. It’s a simple story about a little mouse who enlists the help of his friends, to roll a snowball up a hill. As they do so, the snowball and the die-cut hole in the book get bigger and bigger and bigger until at last.

      An imaginative picture book, beautifully produced in muted tones on gorgeous thick paper. It’s a humorous modern take on a medieval bestiary. By the way, a ‘Zoomer’ is of course, a cross between a farmer and a zookeeper.

      I’ve just started this and it’s brilliant, very funny, enlivened with sympathetic characters, wit by the spoonful and plenty of illustrations by Jim Field. But I can’t read anymore now because my laughter is annoying other people in the office, probably because they wish they were reading it instead of answering emails. <a href="http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/3C95C882-2AA7-4DE7-B37E-8B76D320E38A/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=C2E723B5-A28A-462D-B290-887803C1941B">Also available as an eBook on Overdrive</a>.

This second instalment is just as fast paced and just as funny. Once you start to read, you more or less get abducted too, which is brilliant excuse not to clear the table or do the washing up.

      This un-put-down-able story of a family, forced to emigrate to America during the Irish potato famine, is as inspiring as it is exciting. Slim, the heroine, has courage and determination running through her veins along with a capacity for story-telling fostered by her father. Despite dealing with prejudice, fear and the awful poverty faced by those who are forced to migrate across the world, this book is a super read to add to the growing list of Toksvig titles, and it’s all set for a sequel. If you can’t wait that long before reading another Toksvig tale, read <cite>Hitler’s Canary</cite>, whilst you’re waiting for the next instalment about Slim’s extraordinary life.

      A super little book, full of concise explanations for complex questions, such as; what makes the wind blow? What is a hailstone?. The very jolly illustrations and the board book format aim this at the younger end of our non-fiction readers, but the quality of the information would be useful through Key Stage 1.

      In good time for Christmas, comes this second title in the riotously funny series. Is it even funnier than his <cite>Blunder Years</cite>, or is that just my imagination?

      Inspired by Chris Priestley’s memories of his teenage yearning to escape the mundanity of the lives around him. It’s a compelling read about a society which stifles ambition and imagination, about inter-generational alienation, and about love. His powerful black and white illustrations haunt the book, which Chris Riddell calls “an astonishing novel, beautiful to look at, thrilling to read”. I think we have a future classic right here, right now.
