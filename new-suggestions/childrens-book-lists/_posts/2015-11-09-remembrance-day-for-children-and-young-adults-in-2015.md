      Just aching to be made into a film, this exciting book opens in 1930s Paris before evacuating to “La France profonde”, where work on a revolutionary car design can continue not quite under the noses of the Germans. It’s an adventure with colourful central characters, a moving story of courage and inventiveness, a warm portrayal of a father and son relationship, a gripping tale of invention and engineering and another way to look at life during WWII.

      Billy’s father has gone off to war, and his mother doesn’t want her children to be evacuated from London. During a bombing raid, the tube station they sheltered in and much of their neighbourhood suffers a direct hit and their mum remains unaccounted for. Billy and his little sister fall into the hands of the evacuation officer, and their subsequent adventures take the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride. It’s a superb book, and an atmospheric portrayal of London life during the blitz.

      Michael Foreman grew up in Pakefield during WWII. One of his earliest memories is of the night the village was bombed, and the consequences of those bombs and that war coloured the following years. This gem of a book is his personal record of a wartime boyhood in Suffolk. His beautiful water colour illustrations glow through the book.
