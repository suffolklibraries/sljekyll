      We’re so pleased to see another stunning picture book from Steve Antony. I love his limited colour palette, very patriotic. Even the end papers are beautiful and witty. In his first book, we followed the Queen around the sights of London. This time she follows a swan around the major landmarks of the UK. It would make a super Christmas present, because the production is of heirloom quality.

      A scatalogical tale (toilet humour to you and me). This simple picture book is bound to be popular with young children, though less so for those of us who have ever walked under a bird. The illustrations by Dan Widdowson are full of character and humour. Let’s hope the two of them collaborate on more books soon.

      Have you ever asked a child to stop jumping on the sofa? Yes? Well, you’ll certainly enjoy this cautionary tale and perhaps the children you share books with will curb their exuberance in future. No? Read it anyway, because it’s super – in a rather Lauren Childesque sort of a way.

      A polar bear embarks on a journey around the world to return a family of penguins to the South Pole. (They got lost at the North Pole whilst picnicking.) The story is a delightful read and just resounds with humour, It would be brilliant for topics about journeys, landmarks or countries too, clever old Jeanne Willis.
